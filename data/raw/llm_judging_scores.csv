Orthognathic surgery affects patients’ appearance and ability to chew,1 and improves quality of life,2 but this operation has a complex recovery period.3 Patients undergoing orthognathic surgery cannot consume a standard diet for 6–8 weeks due to trismus and postoperative occlusal management.4 Considering that nutrition in the early postoperative period is thought to be one of the critical factors for faster recovery,5 how well these patients' postsurgical nutritional needs are supported,6 and the effect of this situation on anthropometric measurements and laboratory values poses an essential question for the clinician.
The number of articles published that are related to orthognathic surgery is increasing,7 but most focus on techniques and complications.8 However, studies on postoperative interventions, such as nutritional support,9 which can easily lead to an increase in patients' quality of life, is limited.10–12 There have been studies investigating weight loss after orthognathic surgery,4,12 or the effect of intermaxillary fixation on nutrition after fracture.13,14 However, there is a need for studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow ups.4,12 These studies are necessary for establishing evidence-based nutritional care protocols in orthognathic surgery patients, taking a detailed look at the process, and identifying problems.10,15
This study aims to investigate postoperative changes in anthropometric measurements and laboratory markers in orthognathic surgery patients, serving as a foundation for future studies on intervention. We hypothesise that the surgery significantly impacts these markers, identifying key areas for targeted postoperative care.
Material and methods
Study design/sample
This prospective observational cohort study took place from May 2021 to March 2023 at Marmara University’s Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The study sample was obtained from patients who presented with deformities of the jaws and were scheduled for orthognathic surgery. Patients about to undergo orthognathic surgery and aged 18 to 45 were included, given that they consented to participate and committed to attending follow-up appointments. Exclusion criteria were any of the following surgeries: bilateral sagittal split osteotomy alone, Le Fort 1 osteotomy alone, or Multi Le Fort 1 with bilateral sagittal split osteotomy. Other exclusions included refusal or inability to consent, noncompliance with follow up, or pre-existing conditions impacting postoperative recovery and nutritional status.
During the study, various surgical and biochemical parameters were noted. Blood loss was estimated by subtracting the cooling fluid volume from the total suctioned volume. The surgery duration, from the first incision to wound closure, was recorded. Blood samples were taken for analysis of parameters such as haemoglobin, serum albumin, total protein, and cholesterol levels.
Anthropometric parameters and changes were tracked using measurements such as body weight, body fat, and muscle mass. Height was measured without shoes with a 0.5 cm gauge at the initial visit. Weight and body composition were assessed via a bioelectrical impedance device. Weight loss rate was calculated from pre- and postoperative weights, and BMI was calculated as; weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). An expert dietitian conducted measurements at five time-points: one week pre- and post-surgery, two weeks post-surgery, and one- and three-months’ post-surgery. Lab parameters were evaluated at T0 and T4.
Orthognathic surgery protocol
All patients received bimaxillary orthognathic surgery. Arch bars were not applied to the patients after bimaxillary orthognathic surgery, and functional intermaxillary fixation with metal brackets and elastics was used for two or three weeks. In our study, all patients received standardised recommendations for postoperative dietary consistency from a surgical team. During hospitalisation, all patients received a standardised postoperative diet with homogenous liquid foods, composed of vegetables, soups, fruit juices, and oral nutritional supplements (ONS). ONS composition was 1.5 kcal/ml, caloric distribution of 15%–16% of proteins, 28%–35% of lipids, and 47%–52% of carbohydrates, homogenous, tasteful, and with varied flavour. The liquid diet transitioned to a pureed diet after 1–2 weeks and then to a soft food diet approximately 2–6 weeks postoperatively.
Statistical analysis
Normality was assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Paired t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests compared normally and non-normally distributed variables, respectively. Time-dependent variables were analysed via repeated measures ANOVA or Friedman test, with post hoc analyses using Dunnett's tests. Multiple regression identified variables linked to postoperative weight loss. Analyses were conducted in GraphPad Prism 10 (GraphPad Software Inc) at p < 0.05 significance level.
Results
Descriptive and intraoperative findings
Initially, 70 patients were assessed for eligibility; 60 were included, with exclusions due to surgery cancellations (n = 5), postponements (n = 5), and nonadherence (n = 22). One required revision surgery and was excluded. Of the remaining, 37 patients (62%) completed the study. Participant flow is shown in the STROBE diagram (Fig. 1).

Baseline characteristics were similar between study and lost-to-follow-up groups across various factors (p > 0.05) (Table 1). Mean (SD) operation duration was 315.27 (69.39); mean (SD) blood loss was 416.35 (253.06) ml. First postoperative intake occurred at a mean (SD) of 3.36 (0.93) hours, with a 24-hour oral fluid intake of 1679.05 (492.26) ml.

Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in weight change (%) across the time points. Dunnett's multiple comparisons tests showed a significant decrease in mean weight (kg) with their respective 95.00% confidence intervals (CI) between T0 and T1 (MD = 3.25, 95.00% CI: 2.58 to 3.93), T0 and T2 (MD = 3.84, 95.00% CI: 3.072 to 4.62), T0 and T3 (MD = 3.38, 95.00% CI: 2.58 to 4.17), and T0 and T4 (MD = 2.26, 95.00% CI: 1.295 to 3.23) (Fig. 2A). When applied to BMI changes, the same ANOVA procedure demonstrated a significant effect of time (p < 0.01). Dunnett's multiple comparisons tests showed statistically significant mean differences between T0 and T1 (MD = 1.11, 95.00% CI: 0.87 to 1.34), T0 and T2 (MD = 1.32, 95.00% CI: 1.06 to 1.58), T0 and T3 (MD = 1.16, 95.00% CI: 0.88 to 1.44), and T0 and T4 (MD = 0.76, 95.00% CI: 0.38 to 1.15) (Fig. 2B).

Further investigation into weight loss percentages at different time points for both genders revealed a significant difference across time points (p < 0.01) but not between genders (p > 0.05). The overall mean weight loss percentage for males was −5.24% and −4.31% for females (Fig. 2C).
Significant alterations were observed in various parameters over different time points. Weight demonstrated a mean difference of 3.257 kg, 3.846 kg, 3.381 kg, and 2.262 kg at T1, T2, T3, and T4 postoperative weeks, respectively, all with a p value of < 0.0001 as evaluated by repeated-measures ANOVA. Fat percentage showed changes that were less consistent; although the mean differences were noted as 0.8108, 0.6081, 1.173, and 1.289 at the respective time points, statistical significance was only achieved at T3 and T4 (p = 0.008 and p = 0.023). Body mass index (BMI) followed a pattern similar to weight, showing statistically significant mean differences of 1.114, 1.322, 1.168, and 0.7676 at the four postoperative intervals (all p < 0.0001). Fat mass and muscle mass also exhibited significant changes, with rank sum differences ranging from 54.50 to 60.50 for fat mass and 29.50 to 107.0 for muscle mass, corroborated by adjusted p values of less than 0.0001, analysed using the Friedman test (Table 3).

Laboratory parameters
Haemoglobin levels at T0 were significantly higher than those at T4, as determined by a paired t test (MD = 0.35, 95% CI = 0 to 0.7). The total protein levels at T0 were higher than those at T4; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance (MD = 1.16, 95% CI = −0.57 to 2.89). Total cholesterol and albumin levels also demonstrated similar trends.
Multiple linear regression analyses showed that fat and muscle mass changes mainly explained weight alterations at different times. Fat and muscle mass changes accounted for 80.3% of weight loss from T0–T2, with fat mass changes primarily driving weight loss. From T2–T4, muscle mass changes became more influential, explaining 23.89% of the weight gain variance.
Discussion
This study investigated postoperative changes in orthognathic surgery patients’ anthropometric and lab parameters. The findings confirmed our initial hypothesis: these values are impacted, especially weight and BMI, in the early postoperative period, with no gender effect. Fat percentage determines weight loss in the initial two weeks, while muscle mass influences weight gain thereafter.
Orthognathic surgery,4,6,11,12,15 as well as jaw fractures,13,14 or simply restricting jaw movements for weight control,16 results in weight loss in individuals. Inaba et al observed a statistically significant weight loss by the tenth postoperative day in three groups who underwent single jaw, double jaw, or three-piece surgery, with no substantial differences between the groups.11 In contrast, Ooi et al noted a loss of 5% or more body weight in the second week among five patients from both the wire-based IMF group and the elastic traction group, with none in the first week.4 Hammond et al observed weight loss in nearly all their patients, with an average loss of nearly five kilograms in the first four weeks postsurgery.6 In contrast, Kuvat et al reported weight gain in 30% of patients by the fourth week following surgery.17 Following up with our patients three months after their procedures, we found that most had not yet returned to their initial weights; in fact, a few participants had experienced substantial weight loss of 10% or more, and only a minority had gained weight. Our results, which align with previous findings,10 suggest that the most drastic changes in weight and BMI occur early in the post-surgical recovery period. However, some continued decreases may occur throughout the later stages. These results are also consistent with those reported by Kim et al, who noted an average weight loss of 6.4% two months following surgery.18
To mitigate the influence of gender on postoperative weight loss, several studies have focused on single-gender populations.12 In a large-scale retrospective study, Ruslin et al found that women experienced significantly more weight loss than men.15 However, research by Hammond et al and Kuvat et al, mirroring our study, revealed no significant difference in weight loss between sexes.6,17 In a study exclusively following female orthognathic patients over two weeks, Ooi et al reported that patients lost 2.3% of their pre-surgery weight in the first week, escalating to 3.9% in the second week, suggesting a continued weight loss trajectory.12 In contrast, Christensen et al, focusing on fracture patients, noted that weight loss relative to pre-surgery peaked at 4.9% on the 49th day.14 Our investigation revealed a significant change in weight loss percentages, although no significant gender-based differences were observed.
Significant alterations in fat percentage were observed later in the recovery process, while the early stages showed less pronounced changes. This trend suggests that while the immediate aftermath of surgery may exert a substantial impact on adipose tissue, a stabilisation or recovery phase in fat mass may follow. This observation is comparable to the findings of Hammond et al, where patients lost a portion of their fat mass within the first four weeks postoperatively.6 Similarly, Kuvat et al reported significant changes in fat mass within the first postoperative month in female patients, further corroborating our observations.17 Our study noted significant muscle mass fluctuations over the study period. Initial postoperative weight loss was mainly due to fat mass reduction, while later weight gain was predominantly influenced by increased muscle mass.
Contrary to a meta-analysis10 that found changes in serum albumin and stable haemoglobin levels, our study observed no variations in total protein or albumin but noted decreased haemoglobin levels postoperatively. Importantly, the physiological turnover rate of red blood cells, which is approximately 120 days, should be considered. The observed reduction in haemoglobin levels at the three-month postoperative period aligns with this physiological timeline, suggesting that the turnover of red blood cells could be a contributing factor to these observed changes.
Our study's strengths include access to patients’ presurgical measurements and laboratory data, precise assessments by a skilled dietitian, and regular follow up. While a three-month post-surgical review is sufficient for initial assessments of nutritional status, it is acknowledged that this short follow-up period primarily captures the acute recovery phase. Consequently, the weight changes observed may not be reflective of long-term postoperative outcomes, which could normalise at one year postoperatively. It is imperative to underscore that our study employed functional intermaxillary fixation for two to three weeks postoperatively, allowing patients to consume a pureed diet early in the postoperative phase. This less restrictive approach could have contributed to the observed anthropometric and biochemical parameter changes and is a significant aspect when considering the nutritional and recovery trajectory of orthognathic surgery patients. One of the limitations of this study is its single-centre, observational design without interventions, along with the absence of direct measures to assess nutritional deficiencies or the quality of postoperative healing. Additional limitations include postoperative reductions in patient activity and muscle mass, which can significantly impact weight and dietary intake, variables central to our study. The composition of the diet, in addition to its form and volume, plays a role in metabolic changes and consequently impacts weight and dietary intake metrics. Moreover, the absence of a standardised postoperative diet introduces variability in dietary intake and metabolism, potentially influencing the study outcomes.
Conclusions
The study shows that orthognathic surgery induces temporary, mild to moderate changes in body weight, BMI, and haemoglobin parameters. Future studies should explore whether interventions could alleviate these changes, enhancing patient nutritional status, postoperative recovery, and quality of life.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission
The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from local ethics committee (Approval Number: 29.04.2021/48). Patient permission obtained.","This prospective observational study examined postoperative changes in anthropometric and laboratory parameters among patients undergoing bimaxillary orthognathic surgery, aiming to elucidate how these alterations affect recovery and nutritional status. Conducted at Marmara University from May 2021 to March 2023, the research enrolled patients aged 18 to 45 who met inclusion criteria and followed a standardized postoperative dietary protocol. Participants received a liquid diet immediately after surgery that transitioned to pureed and soft foods over several weeks. An expert dietitian collected data at five time points: one week pre-surgery, one and two weeks post-surgery, and one and three months post-surgery. Measurements included body weight, BMI, fat and muscle mass (via bioelectrical impedance), and laboratory parameters such as hemoglobin, serum albumin, total protein, and cholesterol.

Results demonstrated a significant decrease in weight and BMI during the early postoperative period. Mean weight loss ranged from approximately 3.3 kg in the first week to 2.3 kg by the third month, with fat mass reductions driving early weight loss and muscle mass changes contributing more to later recovery trends. Although fat percentage and most biochemical markers showed variable changes, only the decline in hemoglobin levels at three months reached statistical significance. No gender differences in weight loss percentages were observed.

The study concludes that orthognathic surgery induces temporary, moderate changes in anthropometric and laboratory parameters, emphasizing the potential benefits of evidence-based nutritional interventions to enhance postoperative recovery and quality of life. Limitations include its single-center design, short follow-up period, and variability in dietary intake, suggesting that further research with larger samples and longer follow-up is warranted.","This study investigates the impact of orthognathic surgery on anthropometric measurements and laboratory markers in patients undergoing bimaxillary orthognathic surgery with functional intermaxillary fixation. It was hypothesised that the surgery significantly impacts these markers, identifying key areas for targeted postoperative care.

The prospective observational cohort study followed 37 patients, tracking weight, BMI, body fat, muscle mass, haemoglobin, and other lab values at various points from one week before surgery to three months after. The results indicated significant decreases in weight and BMI in the early postoperative period (up to 2 weeks), with weight loss primarily driven by fat mass reduction initially, then influence from muscle mass. Haemoglobin levels were also reduced by the 3-month follow-up. While these significant changes were observed over time, no significant impact on weight change was found for the additional variables of gender, deformity type, chronic disease status, medication use, supplement use, smoking, nor alcohol use.

The study concludes that orthognathic surgery induces temporary changes in body weight, BMI, and haemoglobin. It advocates for further research into interventions that might improve patient nutritional status, recovery, and overall quality of life after orthognathic surgery.","This research paper investigates the impact of orthognathic surgery on patients' anthropometric measurements and laboratory markers, focusing on postoperative nutritional status and recovery. The study, conducted at Marmara University, involved 37 patients who underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery. Anthropometric data (weight, BMI, fat, and muscle mass) and laboratory parameters (haemoglobin, albumin, total protein, and cholesterol) were measured at multiple time points: preoperatively, one week, two weeks, one month, and three months post-surgery. Results showed significant weight loss and BMI reduction in the early postoperative period, with an average weight loss of 3.25 kg in the first week and 3.84 kg by the second week. Fat mass primarily drove initial weight loss, while muscle mass influenced later weight changes. Haemoglobin levels decreased significantly by three months, but no significant changes were observed in total protein or albumin levels. Gender did not significantly affect weight loss patterns. The study highlights the temporary but notable impact of orthognathic surgery on patients' nutritional and physiological status, emphasizing the need for targeted postoperative nutritional support to enhance recovery and quality of life. Limitations include the short follow-up period and lack of standardized dietary interventions. The findings suggest that future research should explore interventions to mitigate these changes and improve patient outcomes.",18,2.8,14.93,,,95,95,10,100,85,85,10,100,88,90,10,100

Antibiotics’ discovery and the realisation of their clinical significance were major milestones of twentieth century medicine. However, the increasingly widespread, and often inappropriate use of antibiotics has resulted in the emergence of penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.1 By the 1970s, reports of organisms resistant not only to penicillin-type drugs, but multiple other classes of antimicrobial agents, such as tetracyclines and aminoglycosides, were common. This resistance has become a global healthcare crisis, resulting in an increase in resistant hospital-acquired infections.2 Furthermore, antibiotic misuse has resulted in the development of pathogens which are multidrug resistant, raising concerns about the management of certain infections.3 Global estimates indicate that antibiotic resistance will result in approximately 10 million deaths per annum by the year 2050.4
In oral surgery, guidelines for antibiotic use, based on established principles, exist in the literature, and appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy have been demonstrated to be effective in preventing and controlling infections.5 Despite this anecdotal evidence suggests, and peer reviewed surveys confirm, that fundamental principles are often ignored.6 Antibiotic selection is often based on personal preference, antibiotics are often initiated at an inappropriate time and are continued beyond the time required to be influential on reduction of infection rates.6,7
The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised concerns about the misuse of antibiotics amongst dentists in their attempt to reduce aerosol generation by treating odontogenic pain and sepsis solely with antibiotics. Research conducted in England before and during the pandemic showed an 25% increase in antibiotic prescriptions from dentists during the pandemic.8 In South Africa, elective and aerosol-generating dental procedures were postponed in an attempt to help mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This delay in treatment created a fertile ground for injudicious and excessive use of antibiotics.
A study in North America reported that 15%–20% of patients received antimicrobial therapy prescribed via teledentistry consultations or by emergency physicians with limited dental knowledge.9 It was reported that some of the antibiotic prescriptions were not indicated according to the clinical practice guidelines by the American Dental Association.9 Anecdotal evidence suggests that the patterns of use of antibiotics could have been impacted by the pandemic and consequently worsened the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Limited data are however available on antibiotic prescribing patterns of oral health practitioners in South Africa. The present study was designed to evaluate antibiotic prescribing pattern of oral health practitioners before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at Wits Oral Health Centre (WOHC). The specific aims of the present study were (1) to determine the indications for prescribing antibiotics, (2) to determine the type of antibiotics prescribed and (3) to compare the prescribing patterns between the two time periods.
Methodology
Study design
To address the research question, we designed and implemented a retrospective, descriptive study to determine the antibiotic prescribing pattern of oral health practitioners at WOHC over a two-year period: pre-COVID-19 period (23 March 2019-22 March 2020) and COVID-19 pandemic period (23 March 2020-22 March 2021).
Study population
The dispensing records of all patients who received antibiotics were used to retrieve clinical records. The records were anonymised and categorised into two groups. The first group included prescription records of patients during the pre-COVID-19 period. The second group included records of patients who received antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic period.
Study sample
The ideal sample size was estimated at 694 (347 per year) patient records in Epi Info Version 7.2 software at the confidence interval of 95% and an acceptable margin of error of 5% assuming an antibiotic prescription rate of 65.5% among patients who received medications from the dispensary.10
Sampling method
A systematic random sampling method was used i.e., the total population (N) was divided by the sample size (n) to calculate the k number (sampling interval). The records were then arranged in chronological order based on the date of consultation. An initial starting point was selected by a random process, and then every Kth number was selected from the population until the sample size was achieved.10

Inclusion criteria
Patients of all ages who were prescribed antibiotics at WOHC within the specified period.
Exclusion criteria
Patient records with medication prescribed by independent private practitioners where access to the clinical records was not possible. Incomplete or missing clinical records and prescriptions were also excluded from the study.
Ethical clearance
Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Research and Ethics Committee (Medical) at the University of Witwatersrand (Ethics number M210860).
Data collection
Data were collected from the dispensing records, administrative registers, and outpatient clinical records available at WOHC for the period 23 March 2019-22 March 2021. A data collection tool was used to record the data. Data collected included variables such as patient demographics, prescriber discipline, medical history, dental condition, dental procedure, type of antibiotic, dose, frequency, and duration of use. The data were categorised and captured using Microsoft Excel for data analysis.
Data analysis
Frequencies and percentages were used to describe categorical variables such as patient demographics; prescriber discipline; date of prescription; medical history; dental condition; dental procedure; type of antibiotic; dosage, and frequency. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise all the quantitative variables. Statistical significance level for association tests was set at p < 0.05 and estimates were reported at the 95% confidence interval. Differences in proportions between the two periods (pre-COVID-19 vs COVID-19) and between patterns of antibiotic prescription were performed using the chi squared test. The z test was used to assess specifically whether there were differences in the proportion of type of antibiotics used between the pre-COVID and COVID periods. Age was presented as median and interquartile range. All analysis were performed in RStudio (Version 2022.07.1). The results were illustrated using figures and tables created with Microsoft Excel (2021).
Results
Over a two-year period (23 March 2019-22 March 2021), a total of 44067 patients were consulted and 2680 antibiotic prescriptions were written at WOHC. A systematic random sample of 698 records of patients who were prescribed antibiotics was selected and analysed.
Demographic characteristics and medical history of patients
The 698 patients included 186 (53.1%) females and 164 (46.9%) males with a median age of 34 years (IQR 26-49) in the pre-COVID-19 group and 191 (54.9%) females and 157 (45.1%) males with a median age of 33 years (IQR 25-47.3) in the COVID-19 group. A significant proportion of patients in both the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups (70.3% and 73%, respectively) were healthy with no relevant medical history. In both groups, multimorbidity (6% and 4%, respectively), immunocompromised (5.5% and 3.7%, respectively) and diabetes mellitus (4% and 5.7%, respectively) were the most common medical conditions.
Antibiotic prescribing patterns before and during the COVID-19 pandemic
As shown in Figure 1, significantly more antibiotics were prescribed during the COVID-19 period than pre-COVID-19 (9.5% vs 4%; p=0.02). There was a significant reduction in the number of consultations in the COVID-19 group than the pre-COVID-19 group (16542 vs. 27525; p <0.001). In both the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups, antibiotics were mostly prescribed in healthy individuals with no relevant medical history (70.3% and 73%, respectively).

Fig. 1 Antibiotic prescribing patterns in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups. Pre-COVID-19 data are shown in blue and COVID-19 data are shown in orange. There was a statistically significant reduction in the number of patients consulted in the COVID-19 group compared with the pre-COVID-19 (p < 0.001; chi squared test). A significant increase in the use of antibiotics was shown in the COVID-19 group compared with the pre-COVID-19 (p = 0.02; chi squared test).
Comparison of prescribing patterns between the two time-periods in terms of indications for prescribing antibiotics
As shown in Table 2, in both the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups, the common indication for prescribing antibiotics was a painful tooth (n = 180 and 217). Maxillofacial trauma was the second most common indication and occurred more frequently in the pre-COVID-19 group than in the COVID-19 group (15.4% vs 7.2%). In the COVID-19 group, symptomatic third molars (11.8%) were the second most common indication compared to the pre-COVID-19 group (7.4%). The number of procedures performed significantly decreased during the pandemic, with more patients treated with antibiotics only and no procedures as compared to the pre-COVID-19 group (46.8% vs 33.7%; p < 0.001) (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, most of the prescribed antibiotics were not indicated in both the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups (53.1% and 54.3%, respectively).

Comparison of prescribing patterns between the two time-periods in terms of type of antibiotics prescribed
Amoxycillin was the antibiotic of choice before and during the pandemic (62.9% and 62.1%, respectively) (Table 2). There was a significant increase in the use of metronidazole in the COVID-19 group as compared to the pre-COVID-19 group (22.7% vs 15.8%; z = −3.94). The antibiotic combination of choice in both groups was amoxycillin and metronidazole (Table 3). A significant increase in the use of this combination was seen in the COVID-19 group when compared to the pre-COVID-19 group (24.4% vs 16.6%; p = 0.001) (Table 3).

The association between indications for prescribing antibiotics, type of antibiotics, and the prescriber’s discipline
The antibiotic of choice for all dental conditions was amoxycillin (Table 4). The most common indication for prescribing antibiotics in both groups was a painful tooth (58.7%). In maxillofacial and oral surgery, augmentin (29%) was preferred over metronidazole (9.2%) (Table 5). In both the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups, clinicians from maxillofacial and oral surgery and general dental practice were frequent prescribers of antibiotics (43.3% and 22.2%, respectively) (Table 5).

Discussion
We designed this study to determine the antibiotic prescribing pattern of oral health practitioners before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at WOHC, South Africa. The specific aims of the present study were to determine the indications for prescribing antibiotics, the type of antibiotics prescribed, and to compare the prescribing patterns between the two time periods.
We found in this study that despite a decrease in the number of patients consulted during the COVID-19 pandemic era, there was a significant increase in the number of antibiotics prescribed by oral health practitioners when compared with the corresponding pre-COVID-19 era. The reported increased usage of antibiotics in the current study could be the result of poor antibiotic stewardship, limited access to dental care and patients presenting with advanced stages of disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings of a significant reduction in the number of patient consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to other studies that were conducted globally, indicating the impact restrictions and travel bans had on the access and provision of dental services. 11–16
During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions to only non-aerosol generating procedures resulted in an increase in antibiotic prescriptions at WOHC, more antibiotics were prescribed in the COVID-19 group (9.5%) compared to the pre-COVID-19 group (4%). Furthermore, more patients were treated with antibiotics solely rather than with antibiotics as an adjunct to surgical intervention in the COVID-19 group compared with the pre-COVID-19 group. Similar studies conducted in other geographic regions also showed an increase in overall antibiotic prescriptions and a reduction in surgical intervention during the pandemic. 11–16 Also, most of the patients who received antibiotics were healthy with no relevant medical history. The indication for and effects of prescribing antibiotics in healthy patients without surgical intervention is questionable and the potential role it plays in the development of antibiotic resistance is concerning.
In the present study the most common indication for prescribing antibiotics in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups was for a painful tooth. Similarly, in studies conducted in India, Nigeria, and North America, toothache was a common reason for visiting physicians, emergency departments, and dentists.17–21 Our findings underscore the need to emphasise to clinicians that the emphasis in the treatment of a painful tooth is not antibiotic prescription but source control, either by restoration, periodontal therapy, root canal therapy, or extraction. We also observed increased usage of antibiotics in the treatment of dry socket, a condition evidently requiring local treatment without the use of systemic antibiotics in otherwise healthy individuals. 22,23
The decrease in maxillofacial trauma observed in this study may be attributable to the alcohol ban, restrictions on social gatherings, and travelling during various levels of pandemic lockdown.
In other trauma-related studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic there was a decrease in the overall trauma admissions and consultations, in concordance with the present study. 24–28
The present study found that there was a significant difference in the type of procedures performed in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups (p=<0.001). To limit the risk of spread through aerosol generation during the COVID-19 pandemic, most dental procedures were postponed, and instead patients were treated solely with antibiotics. Studies in different geographic locations showed a similar trend in the reduction of aerosol generating procedure and remote management of patients during various levels of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. 11–16
This findings in the present study corroborates previous reports that amoxycillin remains the antibiotic of choice in dentistry.28,29 The antibiotic combination of choice in both pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups was amoxycillin and metronidazole. A scoping review confirmed that this combination is frequently used by dentists and dental specialists worldwide.28 We however observed that there was a significant increase in the use of this combination in the COVID-19 group when compared with the pre-COVID-19 group.
In this study, common antibiotic prescribers included maxillofacial and oral surgery and general dental practice. Similarly, in a study conducted in the United States, general dentists prescribed the most common antibiotics prescribed by oral and maxillofacial surgeons.30 The possible reason for the increased use of antibiotics in oral and maxillofacial surgery could be the result of the dual role the discipline plays in managing dental and maxillofacial emergency conditions.
Limitations
This study only included antibiotic prescription data of oral healthcare practitioners working at WOHC and excluded prescriptions written by private practitioners and inpatient prescription charts. Since it is a retrospective study, data were not as descriptive as they would have been if it were a prospective study with a predetermined format. Also, the outcome of patients treated with and without antibiotics was not included.
Conclusion and recommendations
Notwithstanding its limitations, this study provides valuable data on how antibiotics are used in our institution. From the findings of the present study, which have revealed an increase in antibiotic prescription by oral health practitioners during the COVID-19 period, we conclude that more strategies need to be implemented to strengthen antimicrobial resistance surveillance. The increased prescription without clear indications underscores the need for more robust antibiotic stewardship initiatives. In particular, universally-accepted guidelines on the use of antibiotics in dentistry, its indications, contraindications, and appropriate regimens must be reinforced to reduce unnecessary and inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. Responsible use of antibiotics and the establishment of best practices amongst clinicians will not only reduce antibiotic resistance but will also ease the financial burden to help manage adverse antibiotic effects, which include antibiotic-associated colitis, antibiotic-related allergic reactions, and drug interactions.

Patient permission/consent was not required for this study.","This study examines antibiotic prescribing patterns among oral health practitioners at the Wits Oral Health Centre (WOHC) in South Africa, comparing practices before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing that widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics has fueled the emergence of multidrug-resistant infections, the research addresses a critical global healthcare challenge. A retrospective, descriptive design was employed, reviewing patient records from two periods: pre-COVID-19 (23 March 2019–22 March 2020) and COVID-19 (23 March 2020–22 March 2021). Systematic random sampling yielded 698 anonymized records (347 per period) from 44,067 consultations, with 2,680 antibiotic prescriptions overall.

Data collection focused on patient demographics, medical history, dental conditions, procedures performed, and specifics of antibiotic prescriptions (type, dose, frequency, and duration). Statistical analysis using chi-square and z tests revealed a significant increase in antibiotic prescriptions during the pandemic (9.5% versus 4%) despite a reduction in overall consultations. The most common indication for antibiotic use was a painful tooth, with a notable shift during COVID-19 toward treating patients solely with antibiotics rather than combining them with surgical interventions. Amoxycillin remained the antibiotic of choice; however, its combination with metronidazole saw a significant rise during the pandemic period.

The study underscores deficiencies in antibiotic stewardship and calls for the reinforcement of universally accepted guidelines to ensure appropriate use in dentistry. Enhanced surveillance and robust stewardship initiatives are recommended to mitigate the risk of further antimicrobial resistance. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Human Research and Ethics Committee of the University of Witwatersrand.

The introduction highlights the global crisis of antibiotic resistance, exacerbated by inappropriate use. While guidelines exist for oral surgery, anecdotal evidence suggests deviations, possibly worsened by the pandemic as dentists attempted to manage odontogenic issues with antibiotics alone to reduce aerosol generation.

A retrospective, descriptive study was conducted, reviewing 698 patient records using systematic random sampling. The study found a significant increase in antibiotic prescriptions during the COVID-19 period despite fewer consultations. Most patients receiving antibiotics were healthy, and the most common indication was a painful tooth, often treated without surgical intervention. Amoxycillin was the most prescribed antibiotic, with increased use of metronidazole and amoxycillin/metronidazole combination during COVID-19. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons and general dentists were the most frequent prescribers.","This research paper examines antibiotic prescribing patterns among oral health practitioners at Wits Oral Health Centre (WOHC) in South Africa before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The most common indication for antibiotics was tooth pain, with amoxicillin being the preferred antibiotic. A notable rise in the use of amoxicillin-metronidazole combinations was observed during the pandemic. Many prescriptions were deemed inappropriate, as antibiotics were often prescribed without surgical intervention, particularly for conditions like dry socket, which typically do not require systemic antibiotics. The study highlights poor antibiotic stewardship, exacerbated by pandemic-related restrictions on aerosol-generating procedures, leading to increased reliance on antibiotics. The findings underscore the need for improved antimicrobial resistance surveillance, robust antibiotic stewardship programs, and adherence to evidence-based guidelines to curb inappropriate antibiotic use.

Our project, which utilised the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS) recently published outcome data from the Quality and Outcomes in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (QOMS) project to benchmark data prospectively collected from a small-volume, emerging centre in Northern Queensland, was the first of its kind in terms of validation studies. As expected, the small volume of our centre impacted the ability to derive powerful statistical models and comparators, an intrinsic limitation for small-volume centres whilst they are developing services.

The centralisation of subspecialty head and neck oncology services has demonstrated superior clinical outcomes in higher volumes and concentrated institutional experience.1,2 However, as populations grow, the “hub and spoke” model needs to scale services to meet demand, especially in countries such as Australia where geographical distances are vast and centralisation, whilst improving measurable outcomes,2 often isolates patients from their families and support networks.3,4 Furthermore, with Australia’s indigenous populations, isolation and separation from family and country can further add to issues of cultural safety.5
Whilst health service administration and governments grapple with the logistics of upscaling services, the onus is on clinicians in lower-volume centres to ensure that the level of service delivery is comparable to the standard of care in metropolitan services. If these standards are not comparable, as part of the informed consent process, patients in regional areas should have the option to travel to larger city-based centres. A comparative quality management system is therefore a prerequisite for the safe and effective establishment of regional services.
The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS) recently published outcome data from the Quality and Outcomes in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (QOMS) project, which included oncology and reconstructive surgery.6 The quality metrics selected were based on clinically relevant outcomes that were measurable and actionable by the clinical team. An optimal quality management system should be transferable across similar healthcare systems, facilitating international sharing of best practice and providing a basis for benchmarking outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the QOMS oncology and reconstructive surgery quality metrics in a regional Australian health service setting.
Methods
The objective data points as per the QOMS project were collected and analysed. These data were retrospectively extracted from a prospectively collected database, collected from the 1 January 2021 to 1 February 2023. If any additional data were required, they were manually collected from patient records. Patients were identified from the Townsville University Hospital (TUH) head and neck multidisciplinary team. Any patient with an oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) managed with curative intent was included in our initial collection.
Marginal status and lymph node yield were obtained initially from the prospective data set and then cross-checked by the lead author against the final histological report. Due to the small numbers, deep and mucosal margin status metrics were combined.
Complications as per the QOMS protocol were prospectively collected on every patient undergoing free tissue transfer for oral cavity SCC with curative intent, and cross-checked manually against electronic patient records and discharge summaries. They were recorded only for the 30-day period following surgery. The Clavien-Dindo classification was used to record complications.7
Flap survival was similarly recorded on every patient undergoing free tissue transfer for defects following the removal of oral SCC with curative intent.
Delays to radiotherapy (RT) were obtained from a separate data set collected by the Department of Radiation Oncology. At TUH a different system is used to record radiation doses and thus the department provided more accurate data compared with patients’ electronic records.

Discussion
This study provides indicative data that the BAOMS QOMS metrics for oncology and reconstruction are readily applicable to an emerging Australian regional setting, and likely to retain quality assurance value. Establishing a new service in an institution presents significant quality assurance challenges with hospital administrators obliged to ensure safe and effective care delivery. Central to this is the application of appropriate audit metrics with established external validity. It is no longer acceptable in contemporary health-service provision for compromises to be the accepted norm, citing geographical isolation as an acceptable collateral trade-off for being close to family and social/cultural support.
Benchmarking is particularly important in smaller volumes, as well as in transitional and new services.
Participation in collaborative projects such as QOMS adjusts for small numbers using confidence intervals set at 2 (alert level) and 3 standard deviations (alarm level), and usually depicted as funnel plots. Prospective data submission can also allow for risk adjustment via case mix. There is a modest cost to institutions in the form of personnel to collect and submit data and interact with the clinical team. In so doing, the QOMS is designed to identify and share best practice with the stated aim of improving outcomes over time. It is likely therefore, that larger and more established clinical teams in Australia would also benefit from participation in a project of this type. If replicated elsewhere, these findings support the introduction of a similar quality assurance project for head and neck surgical oncology and reconstruction across Australia and New Zealand.
This study shows that data collection and benchmarking serve as an initial and vital step in the development of a head and neck oncology/reconstructive service. They can demonstrate safety and effectiveness, which can reduce concerns about achieving inferior results in smaller-volume surgical or emerging units, and provide measurable targets with which surgeons and units can aim to ensure that their practice is at the same standard as national or global norms. We acknowledge that the relatively small numbers influence the derivation of meaningful statistical analysis, but they still have a role in providing objective comparators of safety. Our hope is that such projects and benchmarking can continue to develop, not only in head and neck surgery, but also across other subspecialty areas in various surgical fields.

Centralisation of head and neck oncology services has been shown to improve outcomes due to higher volumes and concentrated expertise. However, in a country like Australia—with vast geographical distances and significant indigenous populations—centralised care can isolate patients from their families and cultural support networks. This challenge necessitates ensuring that regional, lower-volume centres achieve standards comparable to metropolitan services so that patients can be adequately informed of their care options.

The study retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from Townsville University Hospital between January 2021 and February 2023, focusing on patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma managed with curative intent. Key metrics included surgical margin status (with margins <1 mm considered involved), lymph node yield, free flap survival, postoperative complications classified by the Clavien-Dindo system, and delays in initiating radiotherapy. Comparative analysis with BAOMS QOMS benchmarks revealed that, despite small numbers, the regional centre’s outcomes for margins, lymph node yield, and free flap success were largely comparable. Some differences, such as a longer postoperative discharge timeline, were noted.

The findings suggest that the BAOMS QOMS quality metrics are transferable to emerging regional services, providing a robust framework for benchmarking and improving clinical outcomes. This approach supports safe service expansion, enhances informed consent discussions by ensuring patients are aware of comparable care standards, and offers a model for quality assurance across other surgical subspecialties in similar healthcare settings.

These studies have revealed a direct association between disc displacement without reduction (DDWoR) and the occurrence of fatty degeneration within the superior fascicle of the lateral pterygoid muscle (SPLM). While the aetiology of this phenomenon remains unclear, it has been suggested that it stems from the interaction between this muscle fascicle and the bony surface of the medial wall of the joint.","Introduction
Alterations in the position of the articular disc constitute one of the most common causes of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pathology. It is estimated that approximately one-third of patients with untreated disc displacement will progress to a more advanced Wilkes stage. These degenerative changes on the disc can occur at any time during the course of the disease and are not necessarily linked to its duration.1–5 Consequently numerous authors have recommended early surgical intervention when conservative measures have proven ineffective. This approach aims to prevent disease progression and subsequent joint deterioration, thereby optimising the likelihood of treatment success.5,6
The TMJ disc is closely connected to the joint capsule throughout its circumference. Except for the structure of the lateral wall of the joint capsule, organisation of the connective tissue of the TMJ remains unclear.7,8 Anatomical studies have described the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM) as a complex structure comprising two distinct muscle fascicles.9–12 The superior fascicle (SLPM) glides along the bony surface of the medial wall and, in most cases, only a few of its superomedial fibres insert into the medial region of the capsule and disc.11 The remaining fibres of the SLPM, together with the fibres of the inferior fascicle of the lateral pterygoid muscle (ILPM), insert into the pterygoid fovea of the mandibular condyle. This anatomical configuration of the SLPM, which descends along and traverses the anteromedial bony wall of the joint and ascends to the condylar fovea, serves to closely cradle the disc against the eminence, resembling a hammock-like support structure.10 Radiographic studies have described the close relation that exists between disc displacement without reduction (DDWoR) and the presence of fatty atrophy of the SLPM.13–17
Arthroscopic notes
To our knowledge, few studies have examined the anatomy of the medial wall of the joint and the relations between the soft tissues and bony surfaces.18 Additionally, limited attention has been directed towards the developmental variability of the bony surface.
Despite numerous attempts to describe the joint capsule, our extensive experience involving over 250 interventions on the medial wall, has not identified any structure that shows the characteristics of a typical capsule (Video 1, Fig. 1). When approaching the anteromedial wall during arthroscopy, separation of the fascia of the SLPM shows two distinct layers. One is closely attached to the muscle fibres, while the other inserts into the inner surface of the medial wall, defining the boundary of the cavity (Fig. 2). The medial bony wall has a variable shape. At times it extends smoothly from the skull base, while in other instances it forms a distinct wall of varying depth. This diversity in structure, coupled with variations in the height of insertion of the SLPM fascia, often leads to the creation of an anteromedial recess in the superior joint space, which may vary in depth and could have implications for disc displacement (Fig. 3).

Fig. 2 Unfolding of the superior fascicle of lateral pterygoid muscle (SLPM) fascia. The external lamina (black arrow) inserts into the inner wall of the medial bone. The internal lamina (black star) accompanies the SLPM to the inferior joint space.

Fig. 3 White arrows: medial wall recess (Type II medial wall). White star: area of attachment of the fibrocartilage of the eminence to the external fascia of the superior fascicle of lateral pterygoid muscle (SLPM). MBW: medial bone wall.
The relation between the bony surface of the anteromedial wall and the SLPM is particularly significant. The presence of a recess in this area is associated with distinct developmental patterns in both the medial bony surface and level of insertion of the SLPM fascia into the wall. In the literature reviewed, we found no reference to the presence of this anteromedial recess in the superior joint space. Using a 1.5 mm hook probe we have been able to differentiate three types of variations in this location to study the differences. Sometimes there is no evidence of a recess and the SLPM descends to form a dihedral angle with the bony surface of the medial wall, which we have called a Type I recess. In other cases a recess with a depth of less than 1.5 mm in this anteromedial region of the superior joint space would be a Type II recess. Finally, if the recess is more than 1.5 mm deep, we have termed it a Type III recess (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4 The variability of the medial wall is determined by the characteristics of the bony wall and its relation with the superior fascicle of lateral pterygoid muscle (SLPM): a) Type I medial wall: the SLPM descends at a dihedral angle without evidence of recess. b) Type II medial wall: the fascia of the SLPM is inserted into the medial bony wall forming an inferior recess of 1.5 mm. c) Type III medial wall: the SLPM fascia is inserted into the medial bony wall, forming a recess in the anteromedial region of the superior joint space equal to or greater than 1.5 mm.
Arthroscopic exploration of the inferior articular space is considerably more challenging, but in cases where the articular disc is perforated, particularly in lateral perforations, it allows visualisation of the anteromedial wall. In these cases, the muscle fibres that should normally attach to the floor of the disc cannot be distinguished. We suspect that these may be the first fibres affected by displacement of the articular disc. Consequently, it is possible to observe tendon sheaths intermingled with muscle fibres descending to insert into the medial wall of the condyle along with fibres of the inferior fascicle (IPLM) (Fig. 5).

The superior fascicle of the lateral pterygoid muscle (SLPM) fibres that should typically attach to the floor of the disc cannot be discerned (star). We suspect these may be the first fibres affected by the displacement of the articular disc. These findings are in line with those found in NRM studies. The muscle and tendon fibres of the SLPM descend to insert into the condylar fovea. LJS: lower joint space. UJS: upper joint space. C: condyle.
Material and methods
Between January 2021 and February 2022, a total of 77 patients underwent osteoplasty of the medial bony wall and high myotomy for the treatment of TMJ disc displacement. A total of 104 joints were treated (50 patients had unilateral TMJ arthroscopy and 27 bilateral arthroscopy). All patients had previously undergone non-surgical treatment, such as occlusal splint therapy, medical interventions, or TMJ rehabilitation programmes, without satisfactory outcomes. Postoperative assessments were conducted with a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. All surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon (GMB). Twenty-one joints with prior interventions, the presence of tumours, or incomplete data, were excluded from the study, resulting in 83 joints for analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 21.0 (IBM Corp). Bivariate analysis employing the Student’s t-test was utilised to evaluate differences in pain levels and mouth-opening capacity.
Surgical technique
A 1.9 mm, 30° approach arthroscope (Dyonics, Smith & Nephew), equipped with video support, is utilised along with 2.2 mm outer protective cannulas for diagnostic and therapeutic arthroscopy. The surgery is conducted under general anaesthesia, employing a double-puncture technique19 This approach necessitates the use of operative arthroscopy instruments and a coblation electrosurgical device (ArthroCare Reflex Corp). For remodelling of the medial wall, a lanceolate sheath with a spherical and Cuda burr (CONMED Corp) is employed. Initially, the fibrocartilage of the medial bony wall is meticulously released from its attachment to the fascia of the SLPM. This dissection must be performed carefully to avoid damaging the nerve and vascular structures within the medial wall while preserving the integrity of the SPLM fascia. Subsequently, a metal guide is placed on the working cannula, allowing for replacement of the cannula with a 2.9 mm lanceolate sheath (spherical burr 2.9 mm CONMED Corp). This manoeuvre facilitates the substitution of the working cannula with the protective sheath for the rotary handpiece in the preceding recess,20 and enables milling of the bone and remodelling of the bony surface of both the anteromedial and medial walls of the TMJ. Once the new line of insertion of the lateral pterygoid fascia to the bone has been established, the drill is removed and the coblator terminal introduced through its sheath. Again, the fascia of the SLPM is released from its insertion into the bony surface, starting from the anteromedial wall, to continue with the previously described bony remodelling of said wall. These manoeuvres are repeated until the medial bony surface is remodelled, ensuring a reduction of no less than 2 mm and no more than 4 mm (Fig. 6, Video 2). Finally, myotomy approximately 1 mm deep is performed to open the fascia of the SLPM at its highest point (Video 3).21

Results
In this series, 20 patients were classified as Wilkes II, 24 as Wilkes III, 19 as Wilkes IV, and 20 as Wilkes V. Statistically significant differences were observed in preoperative and postoperative pain levels. Preoperative pain, as measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS), was recorded at 7.32, decreasing significantly to 2.43 postoperatively (p = 0.0001). Likewise preoperative mouth opening, which averaged 26.35 mm, increased to 30.74 mm postoperatively (p = 0.0001). Data analysis highlighted the more pronounced improvement in pain experienced by patients in the early stages (Wilkes stages II and III). Among those classified as Wilkes II and III, average preoperative pain of 6.97 dropped significantly to 1.35 postoperatively (p < 0.05). Conversely, for patients classified as Wilkes IV and V, the average preoperative and postoperative pain levels were 8.08 and 3.41, respectively (p < 0.05). A pain reduction of 5.62 points was therefore observed in the early stages compared with 4.67 points in the advanced stages. Regarding analysis of the presence of a recess in the medial wall of the joint space among the 69 joints evaluated, 54 exhibited a medial Type II-III recess (78.26%), while 15 patients (21.7%) demonstrated a middle wall Type I recess.
It is important to note that the results regarding pain reduction and mouth opening are based on 65 and 63 patients, respectively. However, these data were not collected consistently for all patients in the study.
Data were incomplete for every parameter, so the results are reported for the number of patients analysed for each variable. The reason for this is that we treat people who are referred from other hospitals around the country and some patients cannot come to our hospital for follow up.
Discussion
The primary outcome of concern in cases of internal derangement of the TMJ is displacement of the articular disc, so optimal treatment involves the anatomical and functional restoration of the disc. However, its unique characteristics present challenges in achieving this restoration. Unlike other joints, in which the disc is fixed to a bony surface, the TMJ features a mobile disc that must move within its functional space. Furthermore, this displacement is not synchronised with the bony surface on which it slides. In short, achieving stability for the disc requires 3-dimensional support, primarily from the lateral and medial walls of the condyle, and a correct muscular arrangement of the LPM to ensure strong adherence to the bony surface of the eminence during displacement. We have not yet addressed the underlying cause of this process, which may be located on the bony surface of the medial wall.
Despite the multiple theories surrounding this clinical condition, further scientific evidence is required to explain it fully. The medial wall has a series of characteristics that could shed light on the development of this disease. First, this is the only extensively perforated space within the joint, allowing the muscle fascicles of the LPM to penetrate. Both muscle fascicles support the disc during its anterior displacement. With their fascias attached to the medial wall, the superior fascicles serve as a pulley mechanism, penetrating below the disc to maintain close attachment to the eminence during movement. These anatomical and arthroscopic findings have been confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, which reveal an evident deterioration, particularly of the SLPM (Fig. 7). In summary, anatomical, radiographic, and arthroscopic observations collectively support the notion that this region is the primary cause of the process.

Fig. 7 a) Disc displacement without reduction (DDWoR) mouth closed, b) DDWoR mouth open (white arrows: articular disc. C: mandibular condyle). In DDWoR all 3-dimensional structures that connect the disc to the condyle are very deteriorated or broken. In this situation the normal condyle-disc relation is lost and mandibular movements tend to worsen. The stability provided by the superior fascicle of the pterygoid muscle is also lost. In these cases, 3-dimensional disc-condyle stability seems difficult to achieve with current surgical techniques.
In our case series, we observed a Type II and III medial wall in 54 of 69 patients studied (78.26%), while 15 (21.7%) exhibited a Type I middle wall. The significance of the anterosuperior and medial recess in the anteromedial wall remains unclear, particularly as we lack data on its incidence in individuals with no articular disc pathology. However, its presence appears to predispose individuals to increased vulnerability to trauma in the superior fascicle, given the need to traverse this thin wall, exposing it more readily to local trauma.
Myotomy of the lateral pterygoid muscle has frequently been associated with various arthroscopic techniques for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Synovectomy of the posterior recess, which has been described in conjunction with myotomy to enhance the position of the articular disc and alleviate symptoms in patients at both early and advanced stages, has yielded favourable clinical outcomes.22–25 Additionally, these techniques have been reported to be associated with anatomical disc replacement using various discopexy techniques.26–31
Involvement of the LPM in the development of articular disc displacement is well-established. Fatty infiltration and hypotonia of the superior fascicle identified in imaging studies suggest that loss of disc stability could contribute to disc displacement.10,13,14,16 This muscle atrophy may be attributed to trauma experienced by the muscle fascicle as it interacts with the medial wall, serving as a reflection point to alter the direction of its fibres and insert into the condylar fovea.
The literature has yet to determine why myotomy should be performed proximal to the junction of the anterior synovium with the anterior edge of the articular disc.22–25 However, several factors could contribute to the use of this protocol. First, accessing the medial wall can be difficult, needing a wide release of the muscle to facilitate repositioning of the disc to a more posterior position. This approach may also serve as a preventive measure against the recurrence of disc replacements. However, this process is not without risks, including the potential for creating a less stable disc in the long term. The anatomical arrangement of the superior fascicle, with its fibres converging to insert into the condyle, suggests that a myotomy proximal to the insertion may sever a significant portion of the muscle fibres of the SLPM. Consequently, the stability of the articular disc could be irreversibly compromised.
Although high myotomy might be regarded as an overly invasive technique, it is, in fact, a highly conservative approach that prioritises the preservation of soft tissues with minimal intervention on the articular fibrocartilage. In this technique, only the fibrocartilage is released from its attachment to the muscular fascia of the lateral pterygoid, enabling remodelling of the medial wall. Consequently, only the muscle fibres in direct contact with the bony wall are affected during the procedure.
When a disc has suffered a reducible disc displacement, all the disc-condyle fixation structures have undergone distension, leading to instability of the disc. A significant group of these patients will present with non-reducible disc displacement over time. It is assumed that these alterations could be the result of disc-condylar impingement when the mandible is displaced.6 In these situations, the fixations that join the disc to the condyle are broken and can hardly be repaired in a 3-dimensional way (Fig. 8). For this reason, to avoid irreversible degenerative changes in the articular disc, early surgical treatment for patients who do not respond to conservative measures should not be deferred. It seems logical that the release of the disc and the trapped muscle structure should be one of the first actions to be performed in the anteromedial region of the joint. The purpose of this technique in the initial stages is to convert a symptomatic joint into a pain-free joint with no joint locking, while avoiding its deterioration.

Evaluating results compared with other surgical groups can sometimes be challenging. This difficulty arises from the fact that the final stage of the disease can vary depending on the observer and other parameters not accounted for in the Wilkes classification, but which nonetheless, are crucial in determining prognosis.32,33 Additionally, the doctor-patient relationship can significantly impact final outcomes. In our practice, patients who present with symptoms of pain and MRI abnormalities that indicate disc displacement and alterations in articular bony surfaces, and who do not respond to conservative treatment, are offered arthroscopy as the primary therapeutic option. Only if a second arthroscopy fails to yield satisfactory results do we consider alternative open surgery techniques.34
Conclusions
The relation between the SLPM and the bony surface of the medial wall appears to play a crucial role in the development and progression of disc displacement. Anatomical variability in this region may contribute significantly to the occurrence of anterior disc displacement.
Intervening on the bony surface of the medial wall and releasing the muscle fibres of the SLPM could potentially stop the degenerative processes occurring in the joint.
Although the characteristics of joints that are prone to degenerative processes remain unknown, it seems logical to assume that persistent pain could be the most important predictive factor when deciding on surgical intervention.
Since the progression of joint degeneration is not linked to the duration of its evolution, early diagnosis and treatment that addresses the underlying cause, together with early rehabilitation, could alleviate or eliminate clinical symptoms while preventing the progression of joint degeneration.

Beginning of high myotomy not exceeding a depth of 1 mm.","This research project investigates the anatomical and surgical aspects of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc displacement, a common cause of TMJ pathology that often progresses to advanced degenerative stages if untreated. The study highlights that approximately one-third of patients with disc displacement experience further deterioration, emphasizing the importance of early surgical intervention when conservative treatments fail. Anatomically, the TMJ disc is supported by the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM), particularly its superior fascicle (SLPM), which forms a hammock-like structure anchoring the disc against the eminence. Variability in the medial wall of the TMJ and its relation to the SLPM is a critical factor; the researchers identified three types of medial wall recesses (Types I, II, and III), with Types II and III being more prevalent among patients.

The surgical technique involves arthroscopic osteoplasty of the medial bony wall and a high myotomy of the SLPM. Using a 1.9 mm arthroscope with specialized cannulas and coblation devices, the procedure carefully releases the SLPM fascia from its bony insertions and remodels the medial wall to reduce friction and restore disc stability. In a cohort of 77 patients (83 joints analyzed), significant postoperative improvements were observed, with pain scores (VAS) dropping from 7.32 to 2.43 and mouth opening increasing from 26.35 mm to 30.74 mm. Notably, patients in early disease stages (Wilkes II and III) showed more pronounced pain relief. The findings suggest that targeting the anatomical interplay between the SLPM and the medial wall may halt or reverse degenerative processes, underscoring the value of early diagnosis and intervention.









","This paper investigates the anatomical relationship between the superior fascicle of the lateral pterygoid muscle (SLPM) and the medial wall of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in patients with disc displacement. The authors observed variations in the medial wall's bony structure, classifying them into three types based on the presence and depth of an anteromedial recess in the superior joint space.

The study involved 83 TMJs that underwent arthroscopic medial wall osteoplasty and high myotomy of the SLPM after failing conservative treatments. The procedure aimed to remodel the medial wall and release SLPM fibers, potentially halting degenerative processes. Postoperative pain significantly decreased, and mouth opening improved, especially in early-stage Wilkes classifications (II & III). A Type II or III recess was observed in 78.26% of the TMJs studied.

The authors propose that anatomical variations in the medial wall, specifically the anteromedial recess, might predispose the SLPM to trauma and contribute to disc displacement. They suggest early surgical intervention for patients unresponsive to conservative measures to prevent further joint degeneration by addressing the underlying cause and promoting early rehabilitation.","This research project investigates the anatomical and pathological factors contributing to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc displacement, a common cause of TMJ dysfunction. The study focuses on the relationship between the superior fascicle of the lateral pterygoid muscle (SLPM) and the medial bony wall of the TMJ, exploring how anatomical variations in this region may predispose individuals to disc displacement and degenerative joint changes. The authors hypothesize that the SLPM, which supports the disc like a hammock, plays a critical role in maintaining disc stability, and that fatty atrophy or trauma to this muscle may lead to disc displacement.

The study involved 77 patients (104 joints) who underwent arthroscopic osteoplasty of the medial bony wall and high myotomy of the SLPM after unsuccessful conservative treatments. Results showed significant improvements in pain reduction and mouth opening postoperatively, particularly in early-stage (Wilkes II and III) patients. The research identified three types of medial wall recesses (Type I-III) and found that 78.26% of patients exhibited Type II or III recesses, which may increase vulnerability to disc displacement.

The authors conclude that early surgical intervention, including bony remodelling and SLPM release, can halt degenerative processes and improve clinical outcomes. They emphasize the importance of addressing the underlying anatomical causes of disc displacement and recommend early diagnosis and treatment to prevent joint deterioration.

At the forefront of this advancement lies TMJ arthroscopy, a procedure that offers a precise approach to diagnosing and treating joint issues. TMJ arthroscopy is indicated in various clinical scenarios where a detailed evaluation and targeted interventions within the TMJ are required to alleviate symptoms, improve joint function, and enhance the overall quality of life of patients suffering from TMJ disorders.","Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthroscopy is an increasingly used technique in the treatment algorithm for temporomandibular disorders. In recent years its effectiveness, safety, and high patient tolerance have allowed it to gain enormous popularity. Patients will often inquire about arthroscopy, which is minimally invasive and results in quicker recovery.
There are primarily three different levels of TMJ arthroscopy. Level 1 consists of diagnostic arthroscopy. Level 2 is a diagnostic arthroscopy, but also has an operative aspect. Finally, level 3 is intended for advanced interventions such as meniscal repair or discopexy.
Articular disorders can lead to significant pain, and an appropriate diagnosis of the articular origin of the pain is important. Failure to diagnose non-articular pain (such as neurological or muscular pain) can diminish the results of surgical intervention. In patients with arthrogenous pain, a meta-analysis of treatment modalities has shown a clear benefit to minimally invasive procedures over non-invasive procedures.1 It is important to obtain an accurate diagnosis of the pathology or arthralgia in the TMJ early in the treatment algorithm to determine when minimally invasive surgery should be considered.1 In a 6-year multicentre trial of 4831 joints, McCain et al found that arthroscopy provided improvement in the treatment of internal derangement, osteoarthritis, hypermobility, fibrous ankylosis, and arthralgia, with good or excellent range of motion (ROM) in 91.6% of patients, good or excellent pain reduction in 91.3%, reduction in disability in 90.6%, and a complication rate of 4.4%.2 In addition to the clearly demonstrated efficacy in improving function and reducing pain, the real benefit of arthroscopy, when properly performed, lies in its minimalist aspect.3 It results in a lower risk of scar tissue formation and tissue damage, which lead to subsequent degenerative changes.4 Some even argue that by improving the condyle-disc relationship and optimising the internal mechanics, we can expect some regeneration.5,6
In patients in whom conservative treatment has failed, level 1 arthroscopy can be used for both diagnostic purposes and arthroscopy-assisted arthrocentesis. The ability to visualise the TMJ is a significant advantage over arthrocentesis. In fact, it allows the surgeon to accurately assess the vast majority of the joint contents and to rule out the presence of defects or pathologies that may have been missed by other diagnostic modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), which is more common than it may seem in the authors’ experience.7 This, in turn, allows for better clarification of the next steps or therapies. It is also an excellent tool, both for academics and for patients looking to better understand their condition. Level 1 diagnostic examination, as described by McCain et al,2 includes the seven points of visualisation: (1) medial synovial drape; (2) pterygoid shadow; (3) retrodiscal synovium; (4) posterior slope of the articular eminence and glenoid fossa; (5) articular disc; (6) intermediate zone; and (7) anterior recess (Figs. 1–3).

Fig. 3 Interior recess of the left temporomandibular joint.
Assessment of the mobility of the disc through jaw manipulation is also a useful and important step in the understanding of disc pathologies. Unless there is a meniscal perforation, arthroscopic examination of the inferior joint space is not done routinely. Level 1 can be considered an arthroscopy- guided arthrocentesis with the benefit of a solid understanding of the joint pathology. Arthroscopy has been found to be superior to arthrocentesis in the management of internal derangement,8 but the incidence of complications is similar (4% for arthroscopy and 3% for arthrocentesis).9
Level 2 arthroscopy, or operative arthroscopy, allows the surgeon to perform operative procedures using a minimally invasive approach in the TMJ. Nowadays, the authors of this article consider it an inevitable step in the treatment of a pathological joint confirmed during the level 1 phase. The ability to biopsy synovial tissue or suspicious lesions helps us to diagnose articular pathologies such as infection, gout and pseudogout, synovial chondromatosis, and systemic arthropathies.10,11 The biopsies can then help us to manage patients appropriately with medical therapies where required. Arthrocentesis can provide benefits in terms of pain and ROM, but will delay diagnosis of non-osteoarthritic pathologies. Additional procedures like myotomy, synovectomy, capsular stretch, and disc manipulation can also be performed. Synovectomy of hyperaemic areas in both the anterior recess and retrodiscal synovium can provide therapeutic benefit by reducing inflammation and pain (Fig. 4).12 These procedures are often performed with a radiofrequency (RF) ablation device or holmium YAG laser. Care must be taken to avoid damage to normal articular surfaces, and it is important to stay away from any procedures near the glenoid fossa. Level 2 arthroscopy has been found to be statistically beneficial in Wilkes II and III patients.13

Fig. 4 Posterior recess synovitis.
Level 3 arthroscopy, or an advanced procedure, includes meniscal repair or discopexy as well as meniscectomy. These can be help to treat internal derangement in Wilkes II, III, and IV patients.
There are multiple different techniques for arthroscopic meniscal repair or discopexy.14,15 The techniques described in the literature differ essentially in the location of the third, or more, arthroscopic portal, and the method of disc fixation or repair. In some methods, the third portal of entry is directly lateral to the capsule, as in the technique described by McCain et al,14 which has the advantage of granting direct access and is easier to execute. However, the traction vector during discopexy is not always ideal as it tends to be lateral. This could also result in the formation of skin indentations. Other authors have described a third portal in the ear canal, like that presented by Ohnishi in the paper by González-García and Martín-Granizo,16 or with a posterior fixation point, like that described by Zhang et al.15 This has the benefit of masking the site—an obvious aesthetic advantage—in addition to creating purely posterior traction on the meniscus. However, a third portal that passes through the ear canal or involves suture exit from this location is more technically difficult to achieve and involves more manipulation. This results in a longer operating time, and thereby increases the risk of complications such as extravasation. For discopexy, some authors recommend a single stitch, while others prefer two.16–18 Admittedly, two stitches reduce the risk of recurrence, but once again, this is more technically difficult to achieve and may lead to over-correction or over-reduction. Finally, during discopexy, fixation can be non-rigid (that is, attached to the subcutaneous tissue), semi-rigid (as with attachment to the cartilage of the external auditory canal) or more rigid (as with the external button technique or a pin attached to the head of the condyle). The type of fixation depends on the level of stability and durability required for the reduction (Fig. 5).6,16,19

Fig. 5 Discopexy using one resorbable suture through a modified tragal approach.
Over the past few years, numerous innovative arthroscopic techniques have been described. The main goals are always to avoid an open approach and to be as little invasive as possible. Arthroscopic reduction of the eminence is one such technique; this aims to improve the prognosis of meniscus repositioning and prevent interference with the articular surface. When a shaver is inserted through the second working portal, the contour of the articular eminence can be smoothed, opening up the joint space. However, the technique itself is not easy since visualisation is often temporarily lost due to the turbulence generated, and it is advisable to remain cautious when making reductions, especially as the cranial fossa may be very close.
Always with a view to improving the overall prognosis of the treatment, some authors have stressed the importance of paying attention to the content of the inferior joint space. They point out that, like the superior compartment, anomalies may be found in the inferior compartment. They even suggest that persistent symptoms after conventional arthroscopy can be explained by undiagnosed or untreated synovitis and fibrous adhesions in the inferior compartment. Others hypothesise that the presence of adhesions in the inferior compartment could have a significant impact on function, particularly in the first step of locomotion. Historically, the inferior compartment has not been investigated unless there has been significant meniscus perforation allowing access to the inferior compartment. Nevertheless, some authors have described different approaches to access the inferior compartment. They largely involve either a conventional approach followed by incision of the anterior or posterior attachment to access the inferior space, or insertion of a cannula with a sharp trocar directly into the inferior space along the lateral pole of the condyle. Accessing the inferior compartment also opens the door to a new range of procedures. For instance, approaches such as high condylar shaving or osteoplasty for osteoarthritis and/or chondromalacia can be considered.20,21
The literature increasingly discusses the use of biological therapy as an adjuvant treatment to arthroscopy. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) both involve use of the patient’s own blood, which is centrifuged. PRGF is PRP activated by calcium chloride and thrombin, which initiates the coagulation process and the formation of fibrin and platelet gel.22 By proceeding so, it confines the material to the injected site and promotes the targeted release of growth factors.
Although the mechanism of action of PRP and PRGF remains poorly understood, the theory is that the released growth factors have a role in the activation and secretion of cells that promote and accelerate the regeneration of damaged tissues.23 The hope is to reduce inflammation locally, ease the resulting pain, and improve the ability to open. The properties of these substrates make them particularly interesting for use in Wilkes IV and V cases. In fact, the literature has shown benefits in terms of pain reduction and improved mouth opening. That said, however, a major bias must be considered when interpreting these results. As these injections are often combined with a surgical procedure, it is difficult to discern with certainty their true beneficial effects. Nevertheless, the literature encourages their use as they are relatively safe.22,24,25
Similarly, the use of hyaluronic acid (HA), which has been widely discussed in the orthopaedic literature, has also made its entry into maxillofacial surgery. HA is a high-molecular-weight glycosaminoglycan that is naturally synthesised by synovial cells and is the main component of synovial fluid. Like PRP and GFRP, its mechanism of action is not yet entirely clear. However, many authors agree that its beneficial effects are linked to an increase in the viscosity and elasticity of synovial fluid. Numerous studies have highlighted the benefits of HA in terms of pain reduction and improved mouth opening. Its safety makes it relatively easy to use at the end of an arthroscopic procedure, particularly in cases of osteoarthritis.1,24,26
Some authors have raised the possibility of using navigation during the procedure to optimise performance and make arthroscopy more accessible. Navigation systems combine imaging (CT, MRI), transmitter/receiver equipment, and interpretation software.27 Because the procedure can be arduous and technically sensitive, the goal of navigation is to simplify the surgeon’s orientation in all three planes and in real time, and prevent them from damaging noble structures. Del Castillo Pardo de Vera et al even argue that the technique enables better localisation of the joint structures that need to be addressed, and makes it easier to measure certain joint defects such as meniscus perforation.28 The use of navigation may be appealing, especially in a teaching context or when first introduced to the technique, but accuracy is questionable given the mobility of the condylar head.
When a prosthetic joint shows late complications, management can be particularly challenging. Determining the real causes behind the clinical picture can be complex. Classically, if patients are not responding well to conservative therapy, algorithm treatments include open approaches with debridement and prosthetic replacement. Hardware failure and heterotopic bone should be visible on imaging, thus the treatment pathway is evident. Synovial entrapment and arthrofibrosis can be a cause of pain and functional limitation, nevertheless their diagnosis is not easy. Their implications in postoperative total knee arthroplasty have been clearly detailed. Arthroscopic management of total joints has been used by orthopaedic surgeons in the last years to handles such issues.29 Davis et al described the use of arthroscopy in cases of painful TMJ prostheses with limited opening. None responded to conservative treatment, and arthrofibrosis or synovial impingement was suspected. Arthroscopy included diagnostic arthroscopy and various procedures such as biopsy, synovectomy, and release of fibrosis.30 This is another example of simple and innovative use of arthroscopy.
The advantages of arthroscopic discopexy over an open approach include smaller incisions, reduced operating time, safe guided joint injections, and a lower risk of complications. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of arthroscopic discopexy have shown improvements in visual analogue scales and maximal incisal opening, with greater changes resulting from arthroscopic procedures than open joint procedures.4 The surgery is minimally invasive, so there is less risk of damaging the joint contents and surrounding structures. This, in turn, significantly lowers the risk of nerve damage or damage to the bone and cartilage. It is therefore rare to see postoperative facial palsy. Similarly, given the minimally invasive nature of the procedure and the minimal dissection required, there is less risk of avascular necrosis. Significantly shorter healing times and shorter recovery times have also been demonstrated. Operating time is significantly reduced compared with open surgery and, unlike some procedures that require arthrotomy, no hospital stay is necessary.31,32 While this has yet to be demonstrated, some authors have even mentioned osteocartilaginous regeneration after atraumatic disc repositioning or repair.5,6 In view of all these benefits and the proven success of arthroscopy, it is becoming more common to prioritise this therapeutic option and to consider it earlier in the treatment algorithm.
While the procedure is generally safe, some intraoperative and postoperative complications may be encountered. Most are minor and temporary. but it is important for the practitioner to be able to recognise them, especially as some can be catastrophic. Otological complications, which have been extensively detailed in the literature, are most often due to incorrect inclination of the trocar during entry or inadequate positioning of the patient’s head. Anatomically, a persistent foramen of Huschke or a large petrotympanic fissure can lead to middle ear involvement. Otherwise, extravasation of the irrigation fluid into the middle ear is the most common cause of hearing impairment; patients may report feelings of fullness, hearing loss, tinnitus, or vertigo. A lacerated ear canal or tympanic membrane can lead to bleeding. If there is auditory damage, specifically to the tympanic segment, then facial nerve damage must also be suspected. Neurological complications are rare, nevertheless their consequences can be severe in certain situations.
Extravasation of the irrigation fluid, especially medial to the mandibular ramus, can lead to temporary numbness in various branches of the trigeminal nerve. Traumatic manipulation or aggressive entry into the joint can also lead to facial weakness. Due to the proximity of the middle cranial fossa, it is important to be very careful when penetrating the capsule and, once the scope has been inserted, to thoroughly examine the glenoid fossa for any potential breaches, which is uncommon but a contraindication to pursue the procedure. As the average thickness of the deepest point of the glenoid fossa is 0.9 mm, it can be easily perforated with minimal pressure.
Extra care is also necessary to prevent intraoperative bleeding, which can render the procedure impractical. Abrupt entry into the capsule or traumatic manipulation of the instruments can damage the superficial temporal artery or the medial aspect of the capsule. If bleeding remains uncontrollable after local measures (compression, increased irrigation flow, anaesthetic infiltration with epinephrine, or electrocauterisation), be prepared to perform an arthrotomy. Although exceptional, arteriovenous fistulas of the superficial temporal artery and middle meningeal artery have been described. Finally, extravasation of irrigation fluid is the most common complication. It is very often benign and resolves spontaneously, but fluid accumulation in the parapharyngeal space may delay extubation and require prolonged postoperative monitoring.9,33,34
Arthroscopy has gained enormous popularity in recent years and its usefulness in the TMD treatment algorithm has been clearly demonstrated. Its reliability, predictability, and safety make it an essential therapeutic modality in the hands of a surgeon with the appropriate training. The authors believe that arthroscopy should more accessible, and encourage future studies exploring its added value.

TMJ arthroscopy provides diagnostic and therapeutic benefits while minimizing tissue trauma, reducing recovery times, and lowering complication risks compared to open surgical approaches. The project delineates three levels of arthroscopy: Level 1 involves diagnostic arthroscopy, which allows visualization of key joint structures including the medial synovial drape, articular disc, and anterior recess, facilitating both diagnosis and arthrocentesis. Level 2 expands upon this by integrating operative interventions such as synovectomy, myotomy, and biopsy, enabling treatment of conditions like internal derangement, osteoarthritis, hypermobility, and arthralgia. Level 3 encompasses advanced procedures like meniscal repair/discopexy and meniscectomy, tailored for more severe cases.

Clinical studies cited in the project demonstrate significant improvements in pain relief, range of motion, and overall function, with a complication rate comparable to less invasive techniques. The authors emphasize the importance of early and accurate diagnosis to distinguish articular pain from other sources, ensuring optimal treatment selection. They also discuss innovative adjuncts, including the use of biological therapies (e.g., platelet-rich plasma, plasma rich in growth factors, and hyaluronic acid) to promote tissue regeneration, as well as emerging navigation technologies to enhance procedural accuracy. Despite minor risks such as otological and neurological complications, the favorable outcomes and reduced invasiveness underscore TMJ arthroscopy’s evolving role as a safe and effective modality in TMD management. Ongoing studies should refine these techniques and evaluate long-term efficacy and safety for optimal patient outcomes in real-world settings.","Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthroscopy is a minimally invasive, increasingly popular treatment for temporomandibular disorders (TMD) due to its effectiveness, safety, and patient tolerance. There are three levels: diagnostic (Level 1), operative (Level 2), and advanced (Level 3) for complex procedures like meniscal repair. Early, accurate diagnosis of arthralgia is crucial, as arthroscopy is beneficial for arthrogenous pain. Studies show it improves range of motion, reduces pain and disability, and has a low complication rate.

Level 1 allows visualization surpassing MRI or CT scans, guiding arthrocentesis, while Level 2 permits biopsies and procedures like synovectomy, proving helpful in Wilkes II and III patients. Level 3 involves complex repairs like discopexy, with various techniques focusing on portal placement and fixation methods, each with pros and cons. Newer techniques address the inferior joint space, and biological therapies like PRP and hyaluronic acid are used as adjuncts for regeneration and symptom relief. Navigation systems show promise, and arthroscopy also addresses complications in prosthetic joints.

Arthroscopic discopexy is superior to open surgery due to smaller incisions, quicker recovery, and reduced risk of complications. While generally safe, potential complications include otological and neurological issues, intraoperative bleeding, and fluid extravasation, requiring vigilance. Arthroscopy's demonstrated benefits and safety profile suggest it should be considered earlier in TMD treatment.","This research project explores the growing use of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthroscopy as a minimally invasive and effective treatment for temporomandibular disorders (TMD). TMJ arthroscopy is categorized into three levels: Level 1 for diagnostic purposes, Level 2 for diagnostic and operative procedures (e.g., synovial biopsy, synovectomy), and Level 3 for advanced interventions like meniscal repair or discopexy. The study highlights the benefits of arthroscopy, including improved pain reduction, range of motion, and reduced disability, with a low complication rate of 4.4%. It emphasizes the importance of accurate diagnosis to differentiate between articular and non-articular pain, as misdiagnosis can reduce surgical efficacy.

The project underscores the advantages of arthroscopy over traditional methods like arthrocentesis, particularly in visualizing joint pathology and guiding treatment. It also discusses innovative techniques, such as biological therapies (e.g., platelet-rich plasma and hyaluronic acid) and navigation systems, to enhance outcomes. Despite its benefits, the study acknowledges potential complications, such as otological issues, nerve damage, and fluid extravasation, though these are generally minor and temporary.

Overall, the research advocates for the increased accessibility of TMJ arthroscopy in TMD treatment, citing its reliability, safety, and effectiveness when performed by trained surgeons.

A study involving 31 patients with temporomandibular dysfunction who underwent level II arthroscopic surgery prior to 2019 is presented.

Objective parameters were assessed preoperatively at one year and five years postoperatively, while quality of life was evaluated both preoperatively and five years after the procedure. Subsequently, the long-term status of patients was analysed, including surgical outcomes and the necessity for supplementary techniques such as second arthroscopy or open surgery. The quality-of-life scores significantly improved (p¬†<¬†0.001) after five years of follow up when compared with preoperative assessments. Pain levels exhibited a statistically significant decrease over the follow-up period (p¬†<¬†0.001). Significant differences were observed between preoperative and both 12-months? and five-years? follow up (both p¬†<¬†0.001) but not between the 12-month and five-year marks (p¬†=¬†0.899). Similar trends were noted for maximum mouth opening, with differences between pre-surgery and both 12-months? and five-years? follow up (p¬†=¬†0.049 and p¬†=¬†0.005, respectively) but not between the 12-month and five-year assessments (p¬†=¬†0.482). Mouth opening at 12 months (p¬†=¬†0.003) and five years (p¬†=¬†0.032), as well as OHIP results at five years (p¬†=¬†0.003), demonstrated statistically significant differences between groups according to the final status. In all cases, poorer clinical outcomes post-surgery (requiring a second arthroscopy or meniscectomy) correlated with decreased mouth opening and worse OHIP results. Arthroscopy emerges as an effective technique in the long-term treatment of temporomandibular joint dysfunction, as parameters such as pain and maximum mouth opening improve, and this improvement remains stable at the five-year follow up.","Introduction
Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) comprise a group of conditions affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), its bony components, and/or its muscular components.1 Symptomatology arises when the physical tolerance of the temporomandibular joint to microtrauma and/or macrotrauma is exceeded. The prevalence of TMD is estimated to be around 31% in the adult population,2 with women being twice as likely to be affected,3 although only 5% require treatment.4 The main symptom is pain, followed by limitation in mouth opening.
Treatment of TMDs encompasses a spectrum ranging from conservative measures such as local heat application, physiotherapy, and pharmacotherapy, with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) playing a prominent role. Local injections of substances such as hyaluronic acid or platelet-rich plasma,5 or more invasive approaches like arthrocentesis or arthroscopy, are considered when patients are unresponsive to conservative treatment.6
The first to perform arthroscopy on the temporomandibular joint was Onishi in 1975.7 Subsequent authors, such as McCain, have further specified, developed, and refined the technique.8 Over the years, numerous studies have been conducted on the efficacy of different arthroscopic procedures, including arthroscopic lysis and lavage or operative arthroscopy, comparing both short and medium-term outcomes.9 Additionally, studies have evaluated modifications to these procedures for the treatment of specific or complex cases.10
Despite the long-standing use and development of arthroscopy on the TMJ and its ongoing evolution,11 current literature lacks evidence determining the long-term status of patients with TMD treated using arthroscopy. Thus, the objective of this study is to preliminarily present the outcomes of patients treated at least five years ago via arthroscopy, analysing both objective and subjective variables, as well as their final status.
Material and methods
A prospective study of patients who underwent temporomandibular joint arthroscopy at the Maxillofacial Surgery Department of a tertiary hospital with a follow up of at least five years was conducted. The study was conducted following the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Ethics Committee under reference number 4921. All patients provided signed informed consent for both surgery and participation in the study.
Patients who underwent arthroscopy from 2010 to 2018 were identified from the hospital’s databases. Selection criteria included: patients over 18 years old without anaesthesia contraindications for surgery, who underwent unilateral level II arthroscopy (double puncture arthroscopy)12 at least five years prior, with Wilkes stages III-V, who had not undergone previous open joint surgeries, attended one-year follow-up appointments, and who had completed the preoperative OHIP-14sp quality of life questionnaire between 15 and 30 days before surgery. Patients requiring bilateral arthroscopy, those treated for conditions other than joint dysfunction (ankylosis, joint tumours), minors, those who did not complete the preoperative quality of life questionnaire, and those who did not attend the one-year follow-up appointment were excluded. The medical records of 50 randomly selected patients operated on between 2010 and 2018 were reviewed using the online minimisation and randomisation (OxMaR) system, and those meeting the selection criteria were chosen: 37 patients were selected (eight did not attend the one-year follow-up visit and five did not complete the questionnaire). Subsequently, these patients were contacted by phone to attend a follow-up visit at least five years after the initial arthroscopic procedure. Finally, 31 patients were included in the study, as six declined to attend this final appointment.
Preoperatively (between 15 and 30 days before surgery), both objective variables such as maximum mouth opening (MMO, measured as the maximum central interincisal oral opening in millimetres) and subjective variables such as pain measured on the visual analogue scale (VAS 0-100mm) were analysed. These variables were reanalysed postoperatively at one year and during the follow-up visit at least five years after the intervention. During this final visit, additional variables were considered, including the presence or absence of signs of joint overload (this evaluation is conducted using the ‘bite test’ or Krogh-Poulsen test, which involves biting down on a flat, thin wedge positioned unilaterally between the molars. Pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) on the same side (ipsilateral) is indicative of a muscular issue, while pain on the opposite side (contralateral) suggests an intracapsular problem),13 the occurrence or absence of pain upon palpation of the articular condyle with the mouth open and closed. This condylar tenderness is systematically assessed as follows: joint palpation is conducted internally (by inserting the little finger into the external auditory canal and applying forward pressure) and externally (by applying pressure to the outer pole of the joint with the index and middle fingers of the hand). This evaluation is performed both with the mouth open and with the mouth closed. Finally, the presence of trigger point tenderness, such as in the masseter muscle, is assessed. Additionally, patients completed the quality-of-life questionnaire (OHIP-14sp) twice: preoperatively and at the follow-up visit at least five years later, aiming to assess the real impact of the pathology and surgery on these patients. During this final review, overall patient satisfaction was evaluated by adding the question of whether they would undergo surgery again to the questionnaire.
The final status of the patients was defined as follows: (1) surgical success (if no additional surgery was required); (2) required second arthroscopy within the first five years of follow up; or (3) required open joint surgery.
Statistical analysis
Absolute values and percentages were employed for categorical variables representation and mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables. The association between variables and the final status were evaluated by the ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U test or the chi squared test, when appropriate. The data present missing values completely at random, therefore, the strategy used (listwise deletion) do not imply biased means, variances, or regression weights.
The comparison of patients’ follow up was performed using t test (for pre-surgery vs post-surgery comparison) or one-way ANOVA (for pre-surgery, 12 months, and five years post-surgery), considering time as the main factor. ANOVA results are expressed as the F-statistics and degrees of freedom. For those variables showing statistically significant time effect a further post hoc comparison was performed (pair-wise comparison with Bonferroni adjustment).
Data were analysed using our own codes and basic functions in R, version 4.2.2 (http://www.R-project.org; the R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
Results
The final sample size was 31 patients, with a mean (SD) age of 34.1 (11.3) years, 30 (96.7%) were females.
The pain variable showed a statistically significant decrease over the follow-up time [F (2, 60) = 13.9, p < 0.001]. Differences were found between pre-surgery and follow up at 12 months and five years (both p < 0.001), but not between 12 months and five years (p = 0.899) (Fig. 1).

The maximum mouth opening variable showed a statistically significant increase over the follow-up time [F (2, 60) = 6.9, p = 0.002]. In the same way, differences were found between pre-surgery and follow-up at 12 months and five years (p = 0.049 and p = 0.005, respectively), but not between 12 months and five years (p = 0.482) (Fig. 2).

The quality-of-life score results improved (p < 0.001), after five years of follow up as compared to pre-surgery. There was a decrease of 7.9 points in the OHIP14sp test at the end of follow up (Fig. 3).

Of all the patients, 41.9% required reintervention; mostly (n = 11, 35.4%) a second arthroscopy within the first five years due to persistent pain at one year. Nine of them (81%) showed improvements in both pain relief and mouth opening. However, among the remaining two patients (19%), mouth opening improved, but pain did not. One patient (3.2%) needed a second arthroscopy after the initial five years due to progressive loss of mouth opening without significant pain. Lastly, only one patient (3.2% of the total) ultimately required open surgery due to decreased mouth opening and elevated pain and underwent a meniscectomy.
Regarding the presence of signs of joint overload in late postoperative assessment, the majority (77.8%) of patients who did not require additional surgical treatments did not exhibit signs of joint overload. However, among those who did require arthroscopy within the first five years, over half continued to exhibit signs of joint overload (54.5%) five years after surgery, with no significant differences between the groups. These results are not considered clinically relevant as patients showed significant improvement in both pain and mouth opening.
Regarding trigger point tenderness, most operated patients (n = 26, 83.8%) still experienced masseter muscle tenderness at least five years later, again, with no statistically significant differences between final patient statuses.
Most patients (87%) did not experience condylar pain upon palpation with a closed mouth at least five years later, but this proportion increased among those who required a second arthroscopy (n = 12, 38.7%). Among patients who underwent arthroscopic reintervention, 16.6% experienced condylar tenderness regardless of the timing of reintervention. Regarding the occurrence of condylar tenderness with an open mouth, this proportion rose to 35.4% among all patients, with a higher incidence noted in those who underwent a second arthroscopy (50% of patients reintervened via arthroscopy experienced condylar tenderness with an open mouth regardless of the timing of reintervention). The patient who underwent meniscectomy did not report condylar tenderness with an open mouth. However, no statistically significant differences were found between the final comparison groups in any of these cases.
The comparison of variables according to the final status of patients is shown in Table 1. Mouth opening at 12 months (p = 0.003) and at five years (p = 0.032), and OHIP results at five years (p = 0.003) presented statistically significant differences between groups. In all cases, there was a worse clinical outcome post-second surgery (second arthroscopy or meniscectomy), with worse mouth opening and OHIP results.

Discussion
Despite the continuous development of minimally invasive techniques for the treatment of TMDs such as arthroscopy since its inception, there are few published studies analysing the long-term outcomes of these procedures due to the limited follow up of patients over time.
Focusing on arthroscopy, there is only one study in paediatric patients with a relatively ‘long-term’ follow up; it involved a one-year follow up of paediatric patients who underwent arthroscopy, demonstrating improvements in both pain and mouth opening, consistent with the findings of this study.14 Although this study demonstrates the efficacy of the procedure in terms of clinical variables, the results may be influenced by the joint’s adaptive capacity in young patients. Therefore, as done in the presented study, it would be interesting to analyse these patients with longer-term follow up to assess the evolution of the condition and the need for further interventions in adulthood.
In adults, the study with the longest published follow up to date has been conducted by our group,15 with a nine-year follow up of 212 patients (though it was a retrospective study), evaluating prognostic factors for surgical outcomes. Initial mouth opening and arthroscopic treatment of adhesions were found to be critical for better outcomes, with patient age not influencing the results. In the case of this study, the selected patients had similar ages, so the influence of age could not be analysed; nor were the presence or surgical techniques used for adhesions evaluated since it is a general preliminary study aimed at evaluating the longitudinal evolution of patients over time, although they will be considered in the ongoing study with a larger sample size. What has been observed among these preliminary results is that patients requiring reinterventions, whether re-arthroscopies at any time or open surgery, had lower initial maximum mouth opening than those who did not require any additional intervention, with the added value that this study prospectively evaluated patients.
In 2022, Oren et al16 conducted a study with a three-year follow up, demonstrating the superiority of arthroscopy with subsynovial corticosteroid injection in mouth opening and pain reduction compared to arthroscopy performed solely in the upper space and with arthroscopic lavage, as well as significant improvement in quality of life. Compared to our experience, two fundamental differences can be observed: firstly, patients treated at our centre and specifically in this study did not receive intra-articular corticosteroid therapy due to the literature having demonstrating corticosteroid toxicity to chondrocytes,17 so the present study is not able to draw any conclusions on this issue. Secondly, for assessing quality of life, they used a numeric scale from 1 to 10 evaluating items such as diet, chewing and speech ability, anxiety, mood, and sleep quality; however, they did not specify how each of these items was evaluated. Furthermore, this scale has not been previously documented or validated in the literature, unlike the OHIP-14sp used in this study, which is a validated quality test specifically for orofacial pathology.18
González-García et al compared arthroscopic lavage with operative arthroscopy in the long term, demonstrating the effectiveness of both techniques in pain reduction, with operative arthroscopy being significantly more effective in patients with Wilkes stage IV.9 In this study, however, we did not find differences regarding the final outcome considering the Wilkes stage, although this result may be influenced by the small sample size. However, it does show the effectiveness of the procedure and the stability of the results over time regardless of the Wilkes stage, as we had previously observed in another study by our group with a four-year follow up.19
Considering the arthroscopic techniques used for discopexy, different studies have evaluated them over long-term follow up. Regarding the placement of resorbable pins, Millón-Cruz et al20 demonstrated pain improvement at five years of follow up, with statistically significant greater improvement at five years than at three years. In this study, however, partial discoplasty was performed in all cases by electrocoagulation of the posterior ligament, and patients improved in terms of pain after surgery, with no statistically significant differences between the three- and five-year follow-up periods. This may be because, after a more complex arthroscopic procedure such as placement of resorbable pins, the joint takes longer to readjust and stabilise. Regarding mouth opening and in line with the results of our study, it significantly improved after surgery; however, no significant differences were observed between subsequent years of follow up.
Referring to other techniques such as arthroscopic disc suture, Yang et al similarly demonstrated a significant improvement in mouth opening and pain in patients with rotational anterior displacement, as well as the persistence of the disc in its repositioned position at two years of follow up.21 Yang’s study, despite having a large sample size, had a more limited follow-up period and analysed the data retrospectively.
The surgical success rate of arthroscopy ranges between 80% and 97%.22 Thus, 10% of patients may require a second reintervention, with re-arthroscopy being a feasible option before resorting to open surgery, achieving pain and mouth opening improvement.23 This aligns with the results presented in our study, where 11 out of 31 patients (35.4%) required a second arthroscopy within the first five years of follow up, and one patient (3.2%) required a second arthroscopy after the initial five-year period. Additionally, the patient who underwent meniscectomy had previously required a second arthroscopy within the first five years of follow up. We do not regard a second arthroscopy as a surgical failure, as it can often represent a definitive treatment option with low morbidity, as evidenced in this article and by Mancha et al.23 It frequently avoids the needs for open surgical intervention, which we do consider a poor outcome of arthroscopic surgery.
In patients with a poor arthroscopic outcome, Konstantinos et al demonstrated a 61% success rate of open surgery in a study analysing data collected over seven years retrospectively,24 being lower in cases with more pain (VAS 90-100) and less mouth opening (MAO 20-29 mm) after the first arthroscopy, with these patients being more likely to require final joint replacement. In the case of our series where meniscectomy was performed, these results partially coincide, as this patient presented one of the highest pain levels (VAS of 80 mm) at 12 months after arthroscopy, and a reduced mouth opening of 24 mm.
Regarding the final situation of the patients, the results of our study show statistically significant differences between mouth opening and quality of life. In all cases, worse initial post-surgical outcomes (requiring a second arthroscopy or meniscectomy) were associated with worse mouth opening and quality of life, which makes sense as these are joints that have required interventions multiple times and continue to degenerate, representing the natural progression of joint dysfunction.25
As for other variables evaluated at the five-year mark in this study, most patients who have had interventions (n = 26, 83.8%) currently experience tenderness upon palpation of the masseter muscles. This result is not surprising and aligns with the literature as more than half of the patients with joint dysfunction have associated muscle components related to bruxism or other mandibular parafunctions.26 Regarding tenderness upon palpation of the condyle both with the mouth closed and open, it is higher in patients intervened with a second arthroscopy regardless of the timing of the intervention, and this proportion is higher with mouth opening, with up to 50% of patients who have had reintervention experiencing it. This makes sense as with mouth opening, the joint space increases as the condyle moves forward, allowing, through palpation, the exploration of the upper joint space which will be painful in cases of synovitis or in joints with distorted anatomy due to manipulation, as is the case. The patient undergoing meniscectomy did not experience tenderness upon palpation of the condyle, which makes sense as it eliminates the painful component of the sensory endings innervating the meniscus.
The study’s limitations stem from its small sample size, inherent to its preliminary nature and the absence of a control group. Future studies will include a larger group of participants to thoroughly examine the techniques used, arthroscopic findings, and how they change over time. This will provide more comprehensive data over different periods, going beyond just before and after surgery.
This study, however, not only demonstrates the results of arthroscopy over a longer period than typically analysed prospectively but also truly evaluates the evolution and final situation of the patients, showing a high degree of patient satisfaction. In terms of clinical variables, patients significantly improve in all groups at one-year post-surgery, and these results remain stable at five years of follow up. The long-term stability of these results is an important finding for future studies. Since no changes were observed between the one-year and five-year follow ups, it may suffice to re-evaluate patients at the one-year mark and consider that as the definitive long-term outcome. However, given the small sample size of this study, caution is warranted. Further long-term studies with larger sample sizes, such as the one we are currently conducting, are needed, and we anticipate that the results will be generalisable.
Additionally, it has been shown that with lower initial mouth opening (as previously demonstrated), and worse initial quality of life, there is a greater likelihood of having a worse post-surgical evolution, with a higher probability of requiring a second arthroscopy or evolving to open surgery. It is also a study that analyses quality of life longitudinally over time, using a scale validated specifically for orofacial pain, providing an idea of the real impact of the surgical interventions we perform on our patients, which also significantly improves when compared preoperatively and postoperatively.
In conclusion, arthroscopy proves to be a beneficial intervention for pain reduction and improvement in mouth opening, with sustained outcomes over time. Nonetheless, there are cases where a second arthroscopy or, less frequently, open surgery may be necessary, particularly among patients with limitations in mouth opening and lower quality of life.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission
Approval from the ethics committee was obtained, with reference number: 4921. Written informed consent was obtained both for the surgery and for participation in the study from all included patients.","Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and associated muscles, presenting primarily with pain and reduced mouth opening. Although TMD has a prevalence of around 31% in adults, only 5% require treatment, with women being more frequently affected. Conservative therapies such as heat application, physiotherapy, and NSAIDs are first-line treatments, but arthroscopy is considered for patients unresponsive to these measures. Introduced in 1975 and refined over subsequent decades, arthroscopy has shown short- and medium-term benefits; however, long-term outcomes remain underexplored.

This prospective study evaluated the outcomes of TMJ arthroscopy with a minimum five-year follow-up. Conducted at a tertiary hospital’s maxillofacial surgery department, the study included patients over 18 years with TMD (Wilkes stages III–V) who underwent unilateral level II arthroscopy between 2010 and 2018. Preoperative assessments included maximum mouth opening (MMO), pain (visual analogue scale), and quality of life using the OHIP-14sp questionnaire. These parameters were reassessed at one year and at least five years post-surgery, alongside physical examinations for joint overload and tenderness.

Results from 31 patients (mean age 34.1 years, predominantly female) indicated significant improvements in pain, MMO, and quality of life at both one-year and five-year follow-ups, with stable outcomes over time. Reintervention was required in 41.9% of cases, predominantly via a second arthroscopy, which was associated with poorer outcomes. Despite persistent masseter tenderness in most, overall patient satisfaction remained high, with all participants willing to undergo the procedure again. These findings support the long-term efficacy of TMJ arthroscopy for TMD. Overall, study underscores need for research.","This study investigates the long-term effectiveness of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthroscopy for treating temporomandibular disorders (TMD). It prospectively followed 31 patients for at least five years after unilateral level II arthroscopy. The study assessed pain (VAS), maximum mouth opening (MMO), and quality of life (OHIP-14sp) preoperatively, at one year, and at the final follow-up.

Results showed significant improvements in pain, MMO, and quality of life one year after surgery, with these improvements maintained at five years. However, approximately 42% of patients required reintervention: most a second arthroscopy within five years. Patients requiring reintervention had lower initial MMO and worse quality of life scores, particularly post second surgery, and had a greater likelihood of signs of joint overload. All patients reported satisfaction and would undergo the procedure again.

The study concludes that TMJ arthroscopy provides sustained benefits for many patients with TMD, though reinterventions are sometimes needed. Lower pre-operative mouth opening and quality of life may indicate less favorable long-term outcomes. A limitation to the study is the small sample size and lack of a control group.","This research project investigates the long-term outcomes of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthroscopy for treating temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), which affect approximately 31% of adults, predominantly women. TMDs cause pain and restricted mouth opening, with treatments ranging from conservative measures to invasive procedures like arthroscopy. Despite its use since 1975, there is limited evidence on the long-term efficacy of arthroscopy. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating patients who underwent TMJ arthroscopy at least five years prior, analyzing both objective (e.g., maximum mouth opening) and subjective (e.g., pain, quality of life) outcomes.

A prospective study was conducted on 31 patients (96.7% female, mean age 34.1 years) who underwent unilateral TMJ arthroscopy between 2010 and 2018. Preoperative and postoperative data were collected, including pain levels, mouth opening, and quality of life (using the OHIP-14sp questionnaire). Results showed significant pain reduction and improved mouth opening at one-year and five-year follow-ups, with no significant changes between these intervals. Quality of life also improved significantly. However, 41.9% of patients required reintervention, primarily a second arthroscopy within five years due to persistent pain. Only one patient required open surgery. Most patients (87%) reported high satisfaction and would undergo the procedure again.

The study highlights the effectiveness of arthroscopy in improving pain and mouth opening, with stable long-term outcomes. However, patients with lower initial mouth opening and poorer quality of life were more likely to require additional interventions. Limitations include the small sample size and lack of a control group. Future studies with larger cohorts are needed to validate these findings and explore the impact of specific arthroscopic techniques. Overall, arthroscopy is a beneficial treatment for TMDs, though some patients may require further interventions.",20,2.7s,17,,,88,90,10,95,82,85,10,90,90,92,10,95

A total of 46 patients who underwent CBCT scans taken before and after sinus augmentation surgery were evaluated. The alveolar bone heights were compared over time. Average and frequency measures, as well as a student?s t-test were performed to determine significant differences between the graft height between the preoperative and post-operative alveolar bone heights. Overall, a statistically significant increase in alveolar bone heights from an average of 5.39-5.49mm to 11.49-13.44 mm was observed on the post-operative CBCT scan (average of 23 months later), p<0.01. In conclusion, the use of bone marrow aspirates from the right anterior iliac crest combined with allogeneic cancellous bone materials can be successfully used to create increased bone height for pre-implant site grafting.","Introduction
When a tooth is extracted, the necessary stimulatory forces that maintain alveolar bone are lost, prompting a reduction in bone1. In a posterior edentulous maxilla, the combination of alveolar bone recession and sinus pneumatization continues until a thin layer of bone separates the oral cavity from the adjacent maxillary sinus2.
The ideal prosthetic restoration of missing teeth is through dental implants3–5. The placement of dental implants requires sufficient alveolar bone quantity and density to successfully osseointegrate6. The posterior maxilla has a lower-density bone, and due to its proximity to the temporomandibular joint receives higher occlusal forces, both factors complicate the osseointegration of implants. When an insufficient amount of bone remains in an edentulous space in the posterior maxilla, and the sinus floor has pneumatized downwards into the space, various corrective surgery techniques called maxillary augmentation, or a sinus lift exists to raise the Schneiderian membrane of the sinus floor and create space for new bone formation7. The increase in alveolar bone may now house implants in the posterior maxilla to aid in the prosthetic reconstruction of the patient’s mouth.
There are various grafting materials that can be used including autografts, allografts, xenografts, combinations thereof, or no grafts to fill the cavity beneath the lifted Schneiderian membrane. This study aims to present the results gained when a sinus lift is performed with the use of an iliac crest bone marrow aspirate. The benefit of a bone marrow aspiration is its mixture of mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, osteocytes, fibroblasts, upregulated bone morphogenetic proteins that are elicited into the sinus lift to help promote efficient bone regeneration at the surgical site8,9. The higher cellularity and osteogenic potential of the aspiration and autogenous bone provides a benefit above the osteoconductive and/or osteoinductive nature of xenografts, synthetic alloplasts, and allografts that are currently used10. We highlight that using iliac crest aspirate promotes sufficient bone growth for implant placement, enabling the use of longer implants, which improves force transmission, stability, and overall prosthetic outcomes for the patient. While other methods have successfully promoted alveolar bone formation, ranging from 3.43mm to 4.8mm depending on their exact method7,11,12, they represent less than half of the average gain we will present in this study. The significance of our increased bone gain allows for the placement of longer implants.
The use of CBCT imaging is considered the standard of care in implant dentistry to provide 3D topographical data of the alveolar bone and jaw anatomy. Its use allows for pre-operative evaluation of the boney housing and assesses the requirement of bone-graft site development and assists in virtual surgical planning of the implant surgery13.
The aim of this observational retrospective study is to assess the vertical gain in new alveolar bone formation after the maxillary sinus augmentation surgery is performed with a right iliac crest bone marrow aspirate using CBCT imaging.
Methods
This study was conducted after research ethics approval was acquired from the Health Research Ethics Board of the University of Alberta (Pro00128288).
The inclusion criteria involved patients with edentate or partially edentate regions in the posterior maxilla with need of maxillary sinus augmentation and implant placement surgery. High-resolution CBCT scans of the posterior maxillary region were obtained to measure the height of the posterior maxillary bone and to evaluate for sinus pathology prior to the procedure. CBCT data of 46 patients, (18 male, 28 female) presented for a sinus augmentation surgery with bone marrow aspirate from the anterior iliac crest between the years of 2016 to 2023 were used. Patients were excluded from the study if they presented with significant medical complications, such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, liver failure, if on IV bisphosphonates, if they have an allergy to any of the materials used, if undergoing radiation or chemotherapy, are current smokers, or are terminally ill. Patients’ charts without post-surgical records were not eligible. Of the 121 patients, 75 were excluded based on the mentioned criteria, leaving 46 to be included in the study. The standard deviation for the observation of the observation was 15.4 months.
Patients undergoing sinus augmentation were examined with a preoperative CBCT scan at the Kingsway Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) and a postoperative CBCT scan, an average of 23 months after the procedure. The CBCT scans were taken with an iCAT machine (Imaging Sciences International/17-19 DX) at a kVp of 120, a current of 5mA, 7.4s and a small FOV with a resolution of 0.25mm voxel size. Pre-surgical sinus floor to alveolar crest height was classified as either eggshell (less than 4 mm of alveolar bone remaining), resorbed (4-7mm), or sufficient (>7mm) with CBCT. Then a quantitative evaluation was done to compare the bone height after the sinus augmentation has been performed with bone marrow aspirates after surgery, to report the generalized amount of new bone formation. The patient identity was anonymized by providing an identifier code, the master list was kept in an encrypted and password protected drive. The CBCT images were saved in Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) format with a slice thickness of one millimeter cross-sections. The data was viewed on InVivo Viewer Anatomage Inc. (Version 6, Santa Clara, CA). For height measurement, the inferior and superior surface of the graft in the maxillary sinus were determined and segmented manually by scrolling through each cross-sectional coronal slice to find the greatest vertical height, and record that as the midpoint of the graft and compare it to the vertical height on the preoperative CBCT scan (Fig. 1). The pre and post CBCT measurements were done by a single evaluator (J.A.) who was trained and calibrated by an Oral Maxillofacial Radiologist.

The midline of the graft was measured for its vertical height in bone (coronal slice) and compared to the vertical height in the pre-operative scan.
A descriptive analysis was conducted to provide a summary of the data on Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Significant differences in vertical alveolar bone heights before and after the surgical procedure were assessed, the paired sample t-test was performed. Sample effect size was calculated using Cohen’s d formula. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.
Surgical Procedure
All patients undergoing sinus augmentation surgery were placed under general anesthesia. Local anesthesia was administered with 3% Marcaine with 1:200’000 epinephrine for hemostasis. Sinus lift procedure was performed. A 3mm diamond round bur delineated the lateral bone window for the maxillary sinus access. Bone marrow aspiration was performed with a bone Jamshidi trocar through the top of the iliac anterior crest. Sinus floor was elevated, and a bone mixture of autogenous bone collected from the iliac crest and Straumann® cancellous allograft (C/C Mix, 250-1000 microns, Basel, Switzerland) were combined in a sterile dish and condensed carefully into the sinus. Straumann® membrane (Basel, Switzerland) was used to cover the lateral aspect of the graft and boney window. Puros® dermis (Zimmer Biomet Dental Canada Inc. ON, Canada) was placed in the membrane to augment the local tissue and a primary closure was completed with 4-0 Monocryl suture.
Results
A total of 121 records of patients who had received sinus lifts using bone marrow aspirates from the right anterior iliac crest from 2016 to 2022 were evaluated. Of the total, 75 patients were excluded from this study due to differences in the surgical procedure and/or lack of post-operative CBCT scans. Of the remaining 46 patients (18 males, 28 females), the average male and female ages were 58.5 and 55.6. Of the 46 patients, all 72 implant sites were evaluated, and sufficient initial fixation was achieved. All sinus augmentation surgeries were successful, none of the patients developed maxillary sinusitis or infections. At the post-operative follow-up radiograph, an average of 23 months away, no implants had failed.
The average pre-sinus lift alveolar bone height for the right side was 5.39 mm (SD = 2.88 mm, n = 30) and the average pre-sinus lift alveolar bone height for the left side was 5.49 mm (SD=3.10 mm, n=31). After augmentation surgery, the right side average alveolar bone height increased to 13.44 mm, a 149% increase in vertical dimension (SD = 4.82 mm). Similarly on the left side, an average of 11.49 mm of alveolar bone height was measured post-sinus augmentation (SD = 4.85 mm), a 109% increase.
An average of 11.7 millimeters of bone was gained after a right sinus lift procedure was completed using bone marrow aspirates from the right iliac crests, and an average of 10.3 millimeters of bone was achieved for the left sinus lifts. Radiographically, the gain of bone height was statistically higher than pre-surgical levels (p<0.01). There was no statistical difference in bone gain between the right and left sinus procedures (p=0.18). Additionally, there were no differences in vertical gain between gender. The patients’ demographics and alveolar bone height measurements can be found in Table 1.

Discussion
This retrospective study evaluated new bone formation in patients who underwent sinus augmentation surgery with the use of bone marrow aspirates harvested from the right anterior iliac crest. The vertical increase in alveolar bone formation was found to be between 10.3mm to 11.7mm, approximately a 2-2.5x increase in height gain in our study. Given the average age of our patients, female and male being between 56 and 59 years old, with an average initial alveolar bone height of 5.39-5.49 mm, this increase in height to approximately 11.49-13.44 mm is comparable to a regeneration to their pre-sinus pneumatization alveolar heights. This gives the patient and the clinician the opportunity for the placement of a longer implant with excess bone remaining apical to the implant. The combination of bone marrow aspirate was concluded that to have increased bone formation when used in sinus augmentation surgery14. Three studies, Perez-Martinez et al11, Moraschini et al16, and Lie et al17 argue that no bone grafting is required to prompt new alveolar bone formation, the purpose is to create space in the sub-sinus cavity. In their meta-analyses, they found a mean gain of 3.43 mm to 4.7mm, but concluded that a graftless sinus lift had a significantly lower vertical bone gain and lower bone density. However, these increases in alveolar bone height may not be sufficient for implant placement, especially when compared to the bone height gained with our bone marrow aspirate method that averaged 10.3-11.7 mm in vertical gain.
Surgery to augment the maxillary sinus is a well-documented method to generate an adequate amount of bone for implant insulation in the posterior maxilla for which various types of bone grafts have been tested. The autologous bone graft technique is considered the gold standard because of its osteoinductive, osteoconductive, and osteogenic characteristics18. Although this approach has certain limitations, such as the need for two surgical sites and a greater demand for donor tissue, to the benefit of the patients, the aspiration is also minimally invasive and is well-managed by postoperative analgesic prescription. A meta-analysis from Wortmann et al19 reported no differences in postoperative pain of the donor site after harvesting from the anterior iliac crest. Thiery et al. found the pain to be a two out of ten20. Bone biomaterials have been explored as alternatives to autologous grafts, though they offer fewer benefits compared to autogenous bone20.
Harvesting bone marrow aspirate from the right anterior iliac crest presents a viable option to increase alveolar bone height in a sinus augmentation surgery. The surgical procedure of sampling a bone marrow aspirate from the right anterior iliac crest involves a small surgical incision and the placement of a trocar needle and cannula to sample bone marrow. When iliac crest marrow cells are placed into the maxilla, they form bone virtually indistinguishable from the bone native to that area21.
Bone marrow aspirates sample mesenchymal stem cells, osteoprogenitors, pre-osteoblasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts, adipocytes, fibroblasts, upregulation of osteogenic genes with higher BMP 2,6 and lower Gremlin-1 inhibitors, which collectively allow for efficient and strong regeneration of bone at the surgical site8,9. Bone marrow is richer in osteoblast quantity and provides a higher volume which makes it a suitable clinical source for constructing bone defects22. This should lead to the creation of a sufficient quantity of bone to allow for good implant placement, and strong enough to promote osseointegration, leading to better patient outcomes.
The rich content of mesenchymal stem cells, osteogenic bone cells, fibroblasts, and growth factors create an environment for effective bone formation and angiogenesis9. Al-Moraissi et al15 compared autogenous bone, allografts, xenografts and alloplasts for new bone formation after a sinus lift. They found autogenous bone to be higher in new bone formation and growth factors, and lower in residual graft loss. They argue that combinations of autogenous bone with osteoconductive substitutes lead to superior outcomes and histomorphometric results after a sinus lift. We therefore demonstrated a consistently significant increase in alveolar bone height after sinus augmentation surgery with the aid of the bone marrow aspirate. In comparison, a study by Choudhary et al12 gained an average of 4.8 mm of alveolar height using a platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) graft and hydraulically-lifting the Schneiderian membrane, and Jeong et al7 found 2.6 mm of gain with the addition of PRF alone. Both of these techniques have reduced alveolar bone gain and limited the choice of length for implant placement.
No histological analysis was performed in this retrospective study to assess bone quality or quantify the proportions of newly formed bone, non-mineralized tissue, and residual graft material, as the percentage of bone cannot be accurately measured radiographically. This study was limited by having a single rater as opposed to being analyzed by two raters and comparing their inter-rater differences in ability to measure the radiological bone gain on CBCT. We consider this a minor limitation considering the measurements were performed using the same third-party software and a single evaluator manipulated all images. Future studies would examine the 3D volumetric size of the grafts, and will examine more long-term outcomes and retention of grafts using this technique. The observational retrospective design of this study was to highlight the results of our sinus augmentation using the bone marrow aspiration. For future research on this technique, it would be beneficial to perform a randomized control trial to allow for comparison with a control group to determine whether bone marrow aspiration is superior to the current techniques.
While sinus augmentation surgery can be successfully completed under local anesthesia and use of bone substitutes, iliac bone marrow aspiration samples mesenchymal stem cells, osteoprogenitors, adipocytes, fibroblasts, upregulation of osteogenic genes, which aid in new bone formation, and improve the osteogenic potential and healing of the graft8,9. When combined with general anesthesia, it creates a controlled surgical environment for extensive reconstruction, reducing patient pain and anxiety while enhancing procedural precision. This may enable the oral surgeon to achieve better outcomes compared to procedures performed under local anesthesia with only bone substitutes.
The use of iliac crest bone marrow aspirate is a reliable technique for sinus augmentation, providing a predictable method to enhance bone formation and healing. It contributes to successful outcomes and should be considered for optimal patient care and a strong foundation for dental implant placement. Additionally, the aspirate can be combined with allogeneic cancellous bone to create clinically suitable graft material for pre-implant site preparation.

The study involved 46 patients (18 males, 28 females) with an average age between 55 and 59 years, who underwent sinus lift procedures between 2016 and 2023. High-resolution CBCT imaging was used preoperatively and postoperatively (average follow-up 23 months) to measure changes in alveolar bone height. Patients with significant medical complications or inadequate post-surgical records were excluded. The procedure combined bone marrow aspirate, containing mesenchymal stem cells and osteogenic factors, with autogenous bone and a cancellous allograft to fill the sinus cavity. Results showed significant vertical bone height gains: preoperative measurements of approximately 5.4 mm increased to averages of 13.44 mm on the right side and 11.49 mm on the left, corresponding to gains of 11.7 mm and 10.3 mm, respectively (p<0.01). No cases of sinusitis, infection, or implant failure were observed. The study concludes that using iliac crest bone marrow aspirate enhances bone regeneration, supports the placement of longer, more stable implants, and offers a reliable alternative to graftless or other graft-based sinus augmentation techniques, improving overall prosthetic outcomes for patients.

The observed changes were not correlated with the extent of the sagittal advancement.","Introduction
In patients with cleft lip and palate, the use of maxillary protraction promotes improvements in phonation and swallowing, as well as reducing respiratory and auditory problems. Additionally, maxillary protraction prevents irritation and deformation of the nasal septum, guides the anatomical positioning of the tongue to avoid sucking habits, and stimulates bone growth along fissure margins. 1–5
Of the possible complications in orthognathic surgeries, relapses are considered the most significant, as they compromise the outcome of the final treatment.
Maxillary advancement relapse is multifactorial and some studies have shown that patients with maxillary clefts are more prone to postoperative instability than non-cleft patients, and estimates suggest that about a quarter of these patients experience relapse within one year after surgery. 6–9
The present study aims to assess the postoperative stability of maxillary advancement in patients with cleft lip and palate.

Sample characterisation
The selection of medical records for this research was done through a search of patient records at the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies/USP (HRAC/USP) obtained from the institution’s Data Processing Centre. The following codes were used: maxillary osteotomy, advancement of the maxilla in three segments without graft, total advancement of the maxilla with graft, total advancement of the maxilla without graft, and Le Fort I osteotomy.
From the medical records and lateral cephalometric radiographs, it was possible to obtain data regarding the patient’s age, gender, type of cleft, the presence of complications associated with the surgical procedure, and extent of movement performed. After data collection, a total of 464 patients were obtained. Of these, 377 patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria according to Table 1 were excluded. The effective sample consisted of 87 patients who met the inclusion criteria, among whom 50 (57.4%) were male and 37 (42.6%) were female. The mean age of the patients was 23.1 years, the minimum age was 17 years, and the maximum age was 37 years. The distribution of the sample based on the type of cleft revealed 54 patients with unilateral transforaminal cleft lip and palate, 24 patients with bilateral transforaminal cleft lip and palate, and nine patients with postforaminal palatal cleft.

Cephalometric radiographs
The lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken with the patient in the natural head position, with condyles seated in the articular fossa and lips relaxed.
Digitalisation of radiographs
The lateral cephalometric radiographs were scanned with an Epson Scanjet G4050 Scanner (Epson); using the Epson Scan program, in the RGB colour system, with 200% magnification, and 300dpi. All radiographs were digitised with the aid of a ruler used as a parameter for cephalometric measurements. The images were adjusted in Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe System) and subsequently indexed in Dolphin Imaging software, version 11.5 (Dolphin), where they could be enlarged by up to 200% without loss of quality. The delineation of dentoskeletal reference points and anatomical tracing, which compose the cephalogram, was performed digitally in a darkened environment yet with adequate light. When bilateral structures were not coincident, an average tracing between images was performed.
Cephalometric analysis
Dolphin Imaging software, version 11.5, was used for the digitised cephalometric radiographs to mark the points and obtain a cephalogram for soft tissue cephalometric analysis. The Dolphin Imaging program automatically draws the cephalogram based on the marking of reference points and cephalometric points, totalling 52 points.
Cephalometric measurements
For this study, various cephalometric measurements recommended for analysis of soft tissues, created by Arnett et al, 1999,8 were utilised. (Fig. 1 – supplementary file, online only).
Maxillary advancement magnitude
To obtain the magnitude of the maxillary advancement, the Dolphin Imaging software tool was used, allowing for the overlay of cephalometric tracings. The overlay of tracings in the preoperative (T1) and immediate postoperative (T2) periods was aligned using the Frankfort horizontal plane (line formed between the Pterygomaxillary Fissure and Orbitale points), thereby ensuring greater measurement reliability. The sample was divided into three groups, considering the horizontal movement amplitude obtained after surgery, with reference to the incisal edge of the upper incisor in periods T1 and T2.
-        
Group 1: Less than or equal to 5mm
-        
Group 2: 5.1 to 9.9mm
-        
Group 3: Greater than or equal to 10mm
Method error
A total of 72 radiographs (from 24 patients) were traced twice by the same calibrated examiner. The first and second tracings were performed at a 15-day interval for standardisation and to calculate the intraexaminer method error.
The error was calculated using the t-test and the Dahlberg error test to respectively evaluate systematic and casual errors and the intra-class correlation test (Table 2).

Statistical analysis
After digitising, the data were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft) for statistical analysis. To assess the differences between the analysed periods, the repeated measures ANOVA test was used through the Sigma Plot Microsoft Excel program (Systat Software Inc) with a significance level of 0.05. The Holm-Sidak test was used for a normal sample distribution, and the Tukey test was used for a non-normal sample distribution.
Results
After overlaying the preoperative and immediate postoperative tracings, it was possible to analyse the distribution of the sample according to the magnitude of maxillary advancement. The data represent 19 patients in Group 1, 30 patients in Group 2, and 38 patients in Group 3. The mean magnitude of movement performed was 9.58mm, with a minimum advancement value of 0.2mm and a maximum of 23.5mm.
The 87 medical records of the total sample were thoroughly reviewed. No postoperative complications were observed in the patients. The values of the variables analysed were distributed in tables to facilitate interpretation of the results. Table 3 shows the relationship of the measurements obtained after a complete evaluation of the study variables, disregarding the amount of advancement performed. Tables 4, 5, and 6 illustrate relationships for the same variables, yet subdivide the sample into groups according to the amplitude of the movement performed; this allows evaluation of differences between the groups.

Dentoskeletal evaluation
Considering the ‘incisor inclination’ variable, stability was achieved with advancements up to 9.9mm. However, in advancements of greater magnitude, a statistically significant difference was observed at point Mx1.
The horizontal dental relationship (overjet) remained stable regardless of the extent of movement performed, while in the vertical relationship (overbite), there was a statistically significant difference for advancements greater than 5.1mm. However, the difference was not considered clinically significant.
Regarding the ‘occlusal plane’ variable, a statistically significant reduction (106° to 102.2°) was observed across all three evaluated magnitudes. In other words, relapse occurrence for this variable did not correlate with the amount of advancement performed.
Projection to the lateral vertebral view (LVV)
A statistically significant reduction was observed in the ‘nose’ variable evaluations. No statistically significant alteration was observed in the ‘A'’ variable during the evaluated period. With the occurrence of oedema in the immediate postoperative period, there was an anterior displacement of the subnasal point, leading to alterations in the interpretation of the values of the ‘Mx1mm’ variable. As this measurement is made in relation to the true vertical line, which is directly influenced by the subnasal point, this finding is justified.
Evaluation of facial length
For the variables related to facial length, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the measurement of the lower third of the face (78.6mm to 72.6mm) and anterior height of the maxilla (25.6mm to 22.8mm). Although there was a decrease in the anterior height of the maxilla, the ‘exposure of the upper incisor’ variable exhibited a statistically significant increase, likely influenced by oedema in the immediately postoperative period.
Evaluation of facial harmony
When analysing the ‘A'-B'’ and ‘LLA-ULA’ variables a statistically significant reduction in values was observed between the immediately postoperative and late postoperative periods. This reduction was likely an influenced of postoperative oedema. No statistically significant alteration was evidenced in the variable ‘G'-A'’. For significant reduction in facial length measurements and angulation of the occlusal plane, there was consequently a statistically significant increase in facial angle (169.6° to 178.7°). In summary, regardless of the extent of maxillary advancement performed, there was a tendency for displacement of the maxillomandibular complex in the counterclockwise direction, evidenced by the flattening of the occlusal plane, decrease in the lower third of the face, and increase in the facial angle, which resulted in a more concave profile.
Discussion
Maxillary advancement is justified for a wide range (minimum of 0.2 mm and maximum of 23.5 mm) by the presence of patients requiring surgery for correction of the cant resulting in slight sagittal movement secondary to the main movement.
Currently, with the advent of induced hypotension anaesthesia techniques, combined with the development of instruments which allow more precise osteotomies, an increase in orthognathic surgery predictability has been observed, with direct reductions in relapse rates. 10–14 This was evidenced in our study.
Maintaining the integrity of the upper arch is a primary factor in preventing surgical relapse, and many authors have discussed alveolar bone grafting for establishing stability. 15–18 In our study, all patients had previously undergone alveolar bone graft surgery and a minimum of six months follow up to evaluate postoperative stability.
Considering the rates of horizontal and vertical relapse in the present study, no positive correlation was observed with the extent of movement performed. There is a lack of consensus among authors regarding this correlation; in some studies, the correlation was present, 19–23 while in others, it was not observed.24 However, it should be noted that when present, the degree of correlation between relapse and the extent of movement performed appears moderate, other factors such as the influence of muscle traction, scar tissue, physiological adaptation, stability of bone fragments, chewing forces, and positioning of the mandible are therefore considered relevant in the occurrence of such post-surgical changes.13
All statistically significant relapses occurred during the first year, a finding later confirmed in other studies.18,21,25,26 Most authors agree that vertical relapse is significantly greater than horizontal relapse and tends to occur predominantly during the intermaxillary fixation period. The current author observed more vertical relapse (41.54%) than horizontal relapse (21.63%). The results of the present study corroborate the literature, as statistically significant vertical relapse was observed.
In 2001,22 a mean maxillary horizontal relapse of 20.5%; with a 22.2% vertical relapse within the first year after Le Fort I osteotomy advancement and fixation using miniplates in patients with cleft lip and palate was reported. One year later, the same group presented a decrease in horizontal relapse to 8.5% (0.4 mm), and 16.7% (0.6 mm) vertically after using autogenous bone grafts in the pterygoid region. Autogenous bone grafts in the pterygoid region have been used by many surgeons as an alternative to surgical overcorrection. However, they carry the risk of bone resorption and displacement as well as additional morbidity at the donor site. In the present study, satisfactory results were observed with the use of rigid internal fixation with miniplates and screws, and the use of elastics for intermaxillary fixation during the postoperative period.
In large advancements, some authors recommend skeletal overcorrection to compensate for interferences caused by muscle tension and the presence of residual scars, which when associated with normal chewing movements accentuate the tendency for post-surgical relapse.22 After the surgical phase, orthodontics plays a fundamental role in the final occlusion. In situations involving surgical overcorrection, compensatory dental movements are necessary to finalise the case. In the present study, the dental inclinations of the incisors remained stable in advancements of up to 9.9 mm. However, with greater advancements, a statistically significant difference was observed at the point Mx1, and a slight posterior inclination was observed, suggesting the influence of compensatory orthodontic treatment on the upper incisors.
In the present study, statistically significant decreases in the measurement of the occlusal plane, lower third of the face, and anterior height of the maxilla were evident. From the immediately postoperative period to the late postoperative period, regardless of the extent of maxillary advancement performed, there was a tendency for counterclockwise displacement of the maxillomandibular complex, leading to a reduction in facial height measurements and angulation of the occlusal plane. This consequently resulted in an increased facial angle, and a more concave profile. Significant changes accompany soft tissues in the postoperative period in orthognathic surgeries.
Conclusion
From the results obtained through evaluation of 87 patients with cleft lip and palate undergoing maxillary advancement, a tendency towards vertical relapse was noted. This vertical instability was observed in the statistically significant reduction of the maxillary occlusal plane (from 106.0 to 102.2), manifesting itself by the movement of the maxillomandibular complex in an anti-clockwise direction, altering the height of the lower third of the face (from 78.6mm to 72.6mm), and the anterior maxilla height (from 25.6mm to 22.8mm), promoting an increase in the facial angle (from 169.6° to 178.7°). The observed changes showed no correlations with the extent of sagittal advancement.

Maxillary protraction in these individuals improves phonation, swallowing, and reduces respiratory and auditory issues, while preventing nasal septum irritation, guiding tongue positioning, and promoting bone growth. However, postoperative relapse remains a significant complication, with cleft patients reportedly at higher risk of instability than non-cleft individuals.

The study analyzed records from the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies (HRAC/USP) between 2005 and 2013. Eighty-seven patients met strict inclusion criteria, including previous secondary alveolar grafting and maxillary advancement performed through a Le Fort I osteotomy with rigid internal fixation using plates and screws, along with high-quality lateral cephalometric radiographs taken preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at least six months after surgery. Patients were categorized into three groups based on the magnitude of maxillary movement (<5 mm, 5.1–9.9 mm, and ≥10 mm).

Using Dolphin Imaging software, 52 cephalometric points were digitally traced and analyzed to assess changes in dentoskeletal and soft tissue structures. The results revealed a significant tendency toward vertical relapse regardless of the extent of sagittal advancement. This was evidenced by a decreased occlusal plane angle, reduced lower facial height, and diminished anterior maxillary height, resulting in an increased facial angle and a more concave profile. Ultimately, the study concluded that vertical relapse is the predominant challenge and does not directly correlate with the magnitude of maxillary advancement. These findings strongly emphasize the necessity for rigorous postoperative management protocols and careful orthodontic adjustments to maintain long-term stability.","This retrospective study assessed the stability of maxillary advancement surgery in 87 cleft lip and palate patients. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were analyzed pre-operatively (T1), immediately post-operatively (T2), and at least six months post-operatively (T3) using Dolphin Imaging software. Patients underwent Le Fort I osteotomy with plate and screw fixation, having previously undergone alveolar bone grafting.

The study found a tendency towards vertical relapse post-surgery, evidenced by a statistically significant reduction in the maxillary occlusal plane angle, a movement of the maxillomandibular complex in an anti-clockwise direction, a reduction in facial height, and an increase in the facial angle, resulting in a more concave profile. These changes were observed regardless of the magnitude of sagittal advancement. While the study identified statistically significant differences in certain cephalometric measurements between T2 and T3, the amount of advancement (divided into three groups: <=5mm, 5.1-9.9mm, >=10mm) did not correlate with the observed relapse. The researchers concluded that vertical instability is a notable factor in post-operative outcomes for maxillary advancement in cleft lip and palate patients.","This research project investigates the postoperative stability of maxillary advancement in patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP) who underwent orthognathic surgery. Maxillary advancement is crucial for improving phonation, swallowing, and facial aesthetics in CLP patients, but relapse—particularly vertical instability—remains a significant concern. The study retrospectively analyzed 87 patients who underwent Le Fort I osteotomy with rigid internal fixation, categorizing them based on the magnitude of maxillary advancement: ≤5 mm, 5.1–9.9 mm, and ≥10 mm. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were used to assess changes in dentoskeletal and soft tissue measurements preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at least six months postoperatively.

Key findings revealed that vertical relapse was more pronounced than horizontal relapse, with significant reductions in the occlusal plane angle, lower facial height, and anterior maxillary height, leading to a counterclockwise rotation of the maxillomandibular complex and a more concave facial profile. These changes were consistent across all advancement groups, indicating no direct correlation between relapse magnitude and the extent of maxillary movement. The study highlights the importance of preoperative planning, rigid fixation, and postoperative orthodontic management to mitigate relapse. The findings align with previous literature, emphasizing the multifactorial nature of relapse, influenced by muscle tension, scar tissue, and bone stability. The study concludes that while vertical instability is common, it is manageable with current surgical and orthodontic techniques.

The primary growth centre for the mandible's upward and downward growth movements is the mandibular condyle. In a growing person, ankylotic fusion of the mandible with the temporal bone retards its growth and causes the mandible to be positioned more retrognathically.1 The three-dimensional pharyngeal airway capacity directly changes as a result of this alteration in skeletal arrangement, which also has an influence on the aesthetic and functional aspects of the stomatognathic system.
There are various treatment modalities to correct temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis, which include arthrolysis, gap arthroplasty, interpositional arthroplasty, and TMJ reconstruction.2–4 These procedures may or may not be accompanied by orthognathic surgery depending on the case at the time of presentation.
Various studies have shown that nasopharyngeal airway volume changes are significant after the release of an ankylotic mass, followed by distraction osteogenesis.5–7 However, there is not much literature on the evaluation of soft tissue changes after interpositional arthroplasty only.8 The purpose of our study was to investigate our hypothesis that immediately after interpositional arthroplasty, airway area changes with the resumption of function, the forward positioning of the mandible, and increased freedom of movement afforded to the tongue.
Material and methods
The present study was a prospective cohort study and began after obtaining institutional ethical clearance. Ten patients of unilateral and bilateral TMJ ankylosis above 10 years of age were included. Patients with false ankylosis or extra-articular ankylosis were excluded from the study to maintain the homogeneity of the sample. Additionally, patients with ankylosis associated with other pathologies or syndromes, recurrent cases of TMJ ankylosis, velopharyngeal incompetence, obesity, adenoid hypertrophy, septal deviation, laryngeal anomalies, and those who declined to participate were also excluded. Preoperative and postoperative data were collected on a specially designed case sheet.
The assessment of skeletal and soft tissue parameters before surgery was carried out as follows. All the lateral cephalograms were analysed by a single blinded oral radiologist. Lateral cephalometric parameters, which were used for soft tissue and skeleton measurement, are summarised in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. A standardised technique was employed throughout the process, by which cephalometric radiographs were taken with the subjects in centric occlusion (the optimal bite position) and relaxed lip posture. This ensured accurate analysis of both skeletal and soft tissue structures. Furthermore, head posture was examined by considering vertebral positions and the Frankfort Horizontal plane, aiming to identify any deviations or misalignments. State-of-the-art equipment, specifically the CS 8100 (Carestream Dental), was utilised to capture radiographs, resulting in high-quality images for precise measurements.

All patients underwent interpositional arthroplasty under general anaesthesia, all surgeries were performed by the same surgeon through the Al-Kayat Bramley incision. The temporalis muscle served as an interpositional graft. Intravenous antibiotics and analgesics were administered to all ten patients for a duration of five days. Patients were discharged on the seventh day and scheduled for follow-up appointments every two weeks. Physiotherapy was initiated on the first day following the operation. Patients were provided with small wooden spatulas, each with 1 mm thickness, to gradually increase their mouth opening by 1 mm per day. They were advised to perform these exercises approximately 6-8 times per day, with each session lasting around five minutes, over a period of four weeks. If necessary, physiotherapy was continued for several months.
After one month, a repeat lateral cephalometric assessment was conducted by the same blinded oral radiologist to evaluate the changes in the upper airway parameters that were measured prior to the surgery.
The collected data were analysed using IBM's SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 20 software. The normality assumptions were assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, where (p > 0.05) indicated that the variables followed a normal distribution. For testing the differences between the values of related pair of variables at different time points (pre- and post-surgery), a paired t-test was conducted. The confidence interval was set at 95%, and the level of significance was defined as 5% (p < 0.05).
Results
Table 4 shows the skeletal parameters measured before and after the surgical procedure. SNA, SNB, ANB and MPH had a preoperative mean (SD) of 81.2 (2.04)degrees; 73.8 (4.28) degrees; 7.4 (3.75) degrees; and 36.7 (8.07) degrees, respectively. While the respective postoperative mean (SD) values were 81.2 (2.04) degrees; 74.5 (4.14) degrees; 6.7 (3.52) degrees; and 36.1 7.78) degrees. Minimal changes were observed in SNB, while ANB showed a decrease, indicating alterations in the maxilla-mandible relationship. Additionally, MPH exhibited a slight decrease, potentially indicating changes in the position of the mandible relative to the horizon.
Table 4 also provides the soft tissue parameters of the study participants, measured before and after the surgical procedure. Variables such as the nasoropharyngeal area, oral area, soft palate area, and tongue area were examined. After the surgery, increases in value were observed in the nasoropharyngeal area (from 3482.4 mm2 to 3618.7 mm2), the oral area (from 2731.8 mm2 to 2840.8 mm2), the soft palate area (from 204.9 mm2 to 217.3 mm2), and the tongue area (from 2577.5 mm2 to 2600.8 mm2) (Figs. 1 and 2).
Discussion
Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis is a debilitating condition that affects the function of the mandible and the surrounding soft and hard tissues, resulting in symptoms such as a retrognathic chin, difficulty in swallowing, and impaired speech. Various methods have been suggested for correcting both the bony and soft tissue deformities, including pre-interpositional arthroplasty distraction osteogenesis, post-interpositional distraction arthroplasty, and simultaneous distraction osteogenesis and arthroplasty.9 In our institution, we opted for interpositional arthroplasty as the initial surgical procedure, as it allows for controlled mouth opening physiotherapy, unlike simultaneous distraction that may disrupt the healing process. Furthermore, interpositional arthroplasty enables the assessment and correction of the actual growth deficit and malocclusion following ankylosis release using distraction osteogenesis. Unlike pre-arthroplasty distraction, post-arthroplasty distraction does not impose limitations on the amount of distraction, as occlusion is not a restricting factor.10
While numerous studies have reported changes in the upper airway area after distraction osteogenesis either before or after interpositional arthroplasty,11,12 limited literature discusses the alteration in the upper airway area solely attributable to interpositional arthroplasty. Therefore, our hypothesis is that not all changes in the upper airway area result from distraction; interpositional arthroplasty also contributes to modifications in upper airway parameters. The change observed after interpositional arthroplasty can be explained by the restoration of mandibular function and relaxation of the muscles surrounding the oropharynx as a result of increased mouth opening and changes in mandibular position. Additionally, the tongue occupies a more relaxed position and its range of motion increases. This was clinical observation, and we did not perform any specialised tests.
Nasal endoscopy, rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinomanometry, cephalometry, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) are some of the techniques for evaluating upper airway characteristics that are described in the literature.13 However, invasive techniques such as nasal endoscopy, rhinomanometry, and acoustic rhinomanometry are seldom used nowadays. CT is costly and may not be affordable for all patients, and radiation exposure restricts its use. Similarly, MRI is expensive and time-consuming. Lateral cephalometry is the most commonly-used method for measuring upper airway volume due to its relative simplicity, accessibility, low cost, and minimal radiation exposure. We opted for lateral cephalometry for measuring airway parameters as it was cost-effective, reliable, readily available and associated with lower radiation exposure. Xin Feng et al14 in their comparative analysis of upper airway volume with lateral cephalograms and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) concluded that lateral cephalometry can be used as upper airway volume measurement. Similarly to that, Vizzotto et al15 conducted a study to assess the accuracy of airway measurements obtained from lateral cephalograms, CBCT axial planes, and lateral reconstructions. Their findings suggest that airway linear measures are accurate, with both lateral cephalograms and CBCT reconstruction, and there is a positive correlation with the corresponding area measurements on axial slices. In another study by Bronoosh et al16 using lateral cephalograms and CBCT, they found that the pharyngeal airway area is strongly correlated to the volumetric data of CBCT. A systematic review was done by Eslami et al,17 in which they stated that the 3D volumetric data can be predicted by the areas of the lateral cephalogram. Ryan et al18 found that the different 3D pharyngeal airway space values can be obtained from CBCT tests with identical scanning and patient positioning techniques. So, this can be seen as one of the demerits of CBCT while evaluating a volumetric data.
The results of our study indicate a significant change (p < 0.05) in pre- and post-surgical skeletal parameters such as SNB, ANB, and MPH. similar results were obtained by El Mofty19 who did cephalometry evaluations to assess facial angles and skeletal parameters before and after gap arthroplasty. They concluded that relocation of the mandible in a forward position after interpositional arthroplasty leads to the decribed changes. In our study sample, most patients were in the growing stage (mean age 15.9 years), and we are of the opinion that mandibular growth contributed to a forward position, resulting in an increase in airway parameters. In accordance with Moss's theory,20 when the intraoral and extraoral muscles resumed their function (of speech, swallowing, phonetics, and jaw movements) after release of ankylosis, they changed form. The muscles’ stimulation also caused mandibular skeletal changes. In another study by Zohaib et al21 the authors found that ramal growth continues without the presence of growth centred transplantation after gap arthroplasty, which contributes to changes in mandibular position. The reason for this change, according to the authors, is postural hyper-protrusion of mandible.
We also observed increase in soft tissue parameters (NOPA, OA, SPA, TA) before and after surgery. The changes in soft tissue parameters observed in our study after interpositional arthroplasty can be attributed to two factors. Firstly, there is a change in muscle activity after surgery, as the soft tissues of the oropharynx and the suprahyoid depressor muscles are significantly affected by TMJ ankylosis. Following surgery, these soft tissue structures become relaxed, and their activity increases due to the improved function of the mandible. Secondly, there is a change in the position of the tongue and related structures, moving them more forward and upward compared to their pre-surgical position, which was more downward and backward. This increase in the upper airway area aligns with a previous case report involving a seven-year-old girl and reached the conclusion that releasing a unilateral TMJ ankylosis demonstrates noticeable clinical and radiological enhancements in the nasopharyngeal airway of patients due to forward positioning of tongue and improvement in hyoid bone position.8
In conclusion, this study evaluated the changes in upper airway parameters after interpositional arthroplasty for TMJ ankylosis. The results showed significant improvements in both skeletal and soft tissue parameters, indicating alterations in the maxilla-mandible relationship and increased values in the areas of soft tissue. These findings contribute to the understanding of the positive effects of interpositional arthroplasty on upper airway parameters, emphasising the importance of addressing skeletal and soft tissue deformities for improved functional outcomes and airway area in patients with TMJ ankylosis. Studies on larger sample sizes will be required to confirm this conclusion. Further research is needed to validate these results and assess long-term stability.

Patient consent obtained.","This research project investigates how interpositional arthroplasty affects upper airway parameters in patients with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis. TMJ ankylosis, characterized by fusion of the mandible with the temporal bone, restricts mandibular growth and leads to a retrognathic jaw, adversely impacting both airway capacity and the aesthetics and function of the stomatognathic system. While various treatments—including arthrolysis, gap arthroplasty, and TMJ reconstruction—exist, few studies have isolated the effects of interpositional arthroplasty on soft tissue changes.

The prospective cohort study involved ten patients over 10 years of age with unilateral or bilateral TMJ ankylosis, excluding cases with false or extra-articular ankylosis and other confounding conditions. Each patient underwent interpositional arthroplasty using the temporalis muscle as an interpositional graft, followed by controlled physiotherapy and gradual mouth opening exercises. Lateral cephalograms, captured preoperatively and one month postoperatively, were analyzed by a blinded oral radiologist. Measurements focused on skeletal parameters (SNA, SNB, ANB, and mandibular plane angle) and soft tissue parameters, including the nasopharyngeal, oral, soft palate, and tongue areas, using standardized landmarks and digital tracing software.

Results revealed a slight increase in SNB, a decrease in ANB and the mandibular plane angle, and statistically significant increases in all soft tissue parameters. These improvements are attributed to the forward repositioning of the mandible, enhanced muscular function, and increased tongue mobility post-surgery. The study concludes that interpositional arthroplasty significantly improves both skeletal alignment and upper airway dimensions, although further research with larger sample sizes is recommended.","This prospective study investigates the impact of interpositional arthroplasty on airway dimensions in ten patients with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis. The study hypothesizes that arthroplasty alone can improve airway area through restored mandibular function and tongue mobility.

Pre- and post-operative lateral cephalograms were analyzed to assess skeletal (SNA, SNB, ANB, MPH) and soft tissue (NOPA, OA, SPA, TA) parameters. Results showed minimal skeletal changes except for a slight SNB increase and ANB decrease, suggesting mandible repositioning. Notably, significant increases were observed in all soft tissue parameters post-surgery (NOPA, OA, SPA, TA), indicating improved airway dimensions.

The authors conclude that interpositional arthroplasty contributes to improved airway parameters by restoring mandibular function, relaxing oropharyngeal muscles, and increasing tongue mobility. Lateral cephalometry proved to be a reliable, cost-effective tool for airway assessment. They suggest larger studies for validation and long-term evaluation.","This study investigates the impact of interpositional arthroplasty on upper airway parameters in patients with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis, a condition that restricts mandibular growth and function, leading to retrognathia and compromised airway dimensions.

Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) comprises a complex group of disorders of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) that can frequently present with chronic debilitating pain leading to significant psychosocial effects1. Epidemiological studies are limited by the absence of a uniformly accepted definition for TMD, though clinically significant TMD symptoms are reported to occur ranging from 1-84% of the population2. Pathogenesis of TMD is thought to be multifactorial and includes biological, social, environmental, emotional and cognitive factors3. Risk factors include age 20 to 40 years old, female sex, other chronic pain conditions and mental health disorders including depression and anxiety4,5.Table 1.

The multifactorial nature of this disorder ensures that diagnosis is challenging. A thorough history and clinical examination are important, but these factors can only provide limited and unreliable information regarding TMD disease status6. Additional imaging may be helpful to correlate with clinical symptoms to formulate a diagnosis and to direct further intervention. MRI remains the gold standard imaging modality for investigating TMD, providing excellent resolution of both soft and hard tissues. Despite this, there remains some controversy in the utilisation of MRI in management of TMD, as correlation between clinical symptoms and radiological evidence of degenerative is poor7,8.
The aim of TMD treatment is to minimise symptoms and restore normal mandibular function, with a view to optimising health-related quality-of-life (QoL). Currently, evidence is limited on contributory factors to quality-of-life in TMD patients, with respect to both imaging findings, past psychiatric history, and clinical symptoms, and there is no current definitive guidance on specific indications for MRI of the TMJ in patients presenting with suspected TMD. We aimed both to assess the factors contributing to QoL using validated psychometric scoring systems, and also to investigate the relationship between patient symptomology, baseline characteristics, and examination findings and objective joint pathology on MRI.
Materials and methods
Participants
Patients attending maxillofacial clinic at a single institution between April 2016 and August 2019, following referral from a general dental practitioner or general practitioner were retrospectively analysed for inclusion. Adult patients who underwent an MRI of the TMJ were included for further analysis. Only patients who completed an IMPARTS questionnaire at the time of review were included. Patient diagnosis was completed according to the Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD)1.
Imaging analysis
MRI sequences comprised dual echo sagittal oblique images in open and closed mouth positions and gradient echo T2* staged dynamic sequences to evaluate for anterior discal displacement with and without reduction as well as T1 coronal and sagittal oblique images to assess for TMJ degenerative changes. MRI scans of the TMJ were assessed by a head and neck consultant radiologist with more than 21 years subspecialty experience, and for study purposes were categorised as follows: (1) normal (meaning no or minimal abnormalities on MRI); (2) anterior discal displacement with reduction (ADDWR); (3) anterior discal displacement without reduction (ADDWOR); (4) and severe degeneration (SD). Although computed tomography does have utility in assessment of TMD, MRI is far better at detecting bone marrow/medullary changes of the condyle, which are an important aspect of condylar degenerative changes, hence preference for MRI in the studied patient cohort.
IMPARTS: pain, depression and anxiety assessment
Patients attending the Oral & Maxillofacial outpatient department are asked to use the IMPARTS (Integrating Mental and Physical: Research Training and Services) system, whereby they fill in validated questionnaires on an electronic tablet4.
Pain was assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire, where patients scored their average and worst pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) 0-10. Anxiety was assessed using the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)9. Patients were given a score between 0-21. For anxiety screening, patients are divided into 3 categories: “No anxiety” (not requiring further intervention; score 0-4); “Mild Anxiety” (Normally not requiring further investigation (score 5-9); and “Significant Anxiety” (Referral to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service; score 10-21).
Patients were assessed for depression using the standardised validated Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)10. Patients were given a score between 0-27. Patients are assigned one of three risk categories, according to both score, and self-harm/suicidal ideation: “No depression” (No further intervention required); “Some depressive symptoms” (referral to IAPT and general practitioner follow up), and “probable major depressive disorder” (referral to liaison psychiatry).
Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA was used to compare average and worst pain scores according to MRI diagnosis, with post-hoc pair-wise contrasts to determine the location of significant differences. The Bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple testing as necessary. To determine the association between predictors and outcomes in the PHQ-9 and GAD-7, both scoring systems were dichotomised according to a threshold of 10. To determine factors associated with normal vs abnormal TMJ on MRI, MRI diagnosis was recategorised as ‘normal’ vs ‘abnormal’ for the purposes of modelling and model validation. Variables were introduced into a backwards stepwise logistic regression model, using Akaike information criterion (AIC) for model selection. Global goodness of fit was assessed using the le Cessie-van Houwelingen-Copas-Hosmer unweighted sum of squares test. Leave-one-out-cross validation (LOOCV) and ROC analysis were used for model validation. Statical analyses were performed using R version 4.0.0. and p-values of less than 0.05 were accepted as significant.
Results
202 patients conformed to the inclusion criteria over the study period. The majority of patients were female (78.7%), and mean age across all patients was 37.71 years (SD 14.9). Bilateral joint symptoms were reported in 65.8% of patients. 18.8% of patients had a pre-existing diagnosis of mental illness, and 24.8% a diagnosis of a chronic pain condition (of any type). Limited mouth opening (<40mm) was the most reported symptom, affecting 50.5% of patients, followed by clicking and locking. Mean pain score across all patients was 5.30 (SD 2.34) and peak score was 6.67 (SD 2.54). MRI findings were relatively evenly distributed; 30.2% had a normal TMJ on MRI or minimal pathology, 20.8% had anterior discal displacement with reduction (ADDWR), 30.2% had anterior disc displacement without reduction (ADDWOR), and 18.8% of cases had severe degenerative change.
Anxiety and Depression in TMD patients
Mean GAD-7 score across all patients was 7.05 (SD 6.26). 29.7% (60) of patients were identified through IMPARTS as at risk of generalised anxiety disorder. On univariable analysis, average pain, worst pain, previous history of mental illness and MRI diagnosis were significantly associated with risk of GAD (Table 2). On multivariable analyses, both past psychiatric history and worst pain were significantly associated with increased odds of risk of GAD. By contrast, although not reaching statistical significance, a diagnosis of ADDWR was relatively protective compared to other MRI diagnoses (p = 0.0620; Table 2; figure 1).

Mean PHQ-9 score was 9.49 (SD 6.85), resulting in 49.5% (100) of patients in the ‘at risk’ category according to a threshold score of 10. Similar to GAD-7, history of prior mental illness, worst pain score and average pain score were found to be significantly associated with risk of depression on univariable analysis (Table 2). On multivariable analysis, worst pain was found to be strongly predictive of risk of depression.
Pain in TMD
Average pain score was highest in the “normal” patient category, with a score of 5.7 (SD 2.17), followed by the degenerative group (5.58; SD 2.6), ADDWR (5.02; SD 2.58) and ADDWOR (4.92; SD 2.12; figure 2). No significant difference was identified in average pain score according to MRI diagnosis (F(3,198) = 1.42, p = 0.240). Similarly, worst pain score was highest in the normal group (mean 7.15; SD 2.16), followed by degenerative change (7.05; SD 2.63), ADDWOR (6.33; SD 2.50) and ADDWR (6.12; SD 2.89). Worst pain scores were similar between MRI diagnostic groups on one-way ANOVA (F(3,198) = 2.07, p = 0.105).

Joint pathology on MRI
Mean GAD7 score, as a proxy of anxiety, was higher in patients with a normal TMJ on univariable analysis. On multivariable analysis, unilateral joint involvement (OR 2.48 [95%CI 1.20; 5.46], p = 0.012), locking (OR 4.28 [95%CI 1.63; 13.63], p = 0.006), and clicking (OR 2.14 [95%CI 1.05; 4.60], p = 0.042) were significantly associated with increased odds of an abnormal TMJ on MRI. By contrast, increasing GAD7 score (as a proxy for anxiety; OR 0.93 [95%CI 0.88;0.99], p = 0.016) and male gender (OR 0.35 [95%CI 0.15;0.79], p = 0.012) were significantly predictive of a normal joint morphology on MR (Table 3)I.

Discussion
The current study identified a number of factors that were associated with both patient disease experience and with the likelihood of identifying objective joint pathology on MRI.
Past psychiatric history and worst pain were significantly associated with an increased risk of generalised anxiety disorder, while worst pain was found to be predictive of risk of depression. We identified that female gender, unilateral joint symptoms, and reported locking and clicking were significantly predictive of an abnormal joint on MRI. Increasing GAD7 scores, indicating elevated risk of anxiety, were significantly associated with the likelihood of a normal joint on MRI. Accuracy of this model on Leave-One-Out Cross validation was 0.738, and AUC was found to be 0.74, indicating some predictive value of patient symptomology, mental health indices and patient baseline characteristics in determining objective MRI findings. Nonetheless, the finding that greater anxiety was significantly associated with the odds of normal joint morphology on MRI support the complex multifactorial aetiology of TMD. The finding of greater risk of anxiety, and a trend (although not statistically significant) towards worse pain scores with a normal joint on MRI, may reflect a diagnosis of myofascial TMD. A further curious finding here is that female gender was significantly associated with increased likelihood of an abnormal joint on MRI, perhaps suggesting discrepancy in the aetiology of TMD between genders.
Baset et al, in a cohort of 98 patients, found no correlation between severity of patient self-reported objective TMD symptoms and MRI results based on patient history using Helkimo clinical amnestic indices12. When Basat et al used objective symptoms from clinical examination and the Helkimo clinical dysfunction indices, the severity did correlate with MRI findings. Wurm et al found weak correlation between pain (VAS) and specific TMJ findings on MRI (disc morphology, disc luxation and osteoarthritic changes)7. In our study we looked at gross anatomical changes and our findings align with those of Wurm et al. in that VAS pain scores correlates poorly with anatomical changes on MRI.
Previous studies have also correlated mental health with TMD in the general population versus patients without TMD. In a study of 4.1 million veterans, Fenton et al. found an association between TMD and major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders compared to veterans without TMD13. Augosto et al. found that Brazilian students with TMD perceived stress more often and there was a moderate correlation between TMD and mental health disorders compared to students without TMD14. Simoen et al compared GAD-7 and PHQ-9 results from patients with TMD with the general population and found TMD patients score higher15. The link between TMD and mental health supports current practice at our institute to screen TMD patients for anxiety and depression.
Our study differs from previously mentioned studies as we attempted to determine patient factors and imaging findings that predict anxiety and depression within the TMD patient cohort. The results of the current study support that the likelihood of mental health disorder cannot be reliably attributed to a specific MRI-confirmed TMD diagnosis (normal, degenerative, ADDWR and ADDWOR), and that clinicians should be vigilant for mental health disorder irrespective of suspected aetiology. It is clear, however, from multivariable analyses on both GAD7 and PHQ9 scores, that worst pain was significantly predictive of risk of depression and anxiety. In keeping with the key objectives of TMD management, namely optimising symptoms and function, clinicians should strive to minimise pain in the interests of improving the patient’s disease experience.
Further, our results suggest that specific clinical symptoms and baseline characteristics have a significant association with joint pathology. Female gender, unilateral symptoms, clicking and locking may all be used as key indicators of possible joint pathology which would greatly benefit from further radiological diagnostics such as MRI. Our results suggest that MRI is an invaluable adjunct in clarifying joint pathology particularly in cases with clinical symptoms of arthrogenic TMD.
This study does have potential limitations. MRI is offered, in accordance with the literature, to those patients who fail to sufficiently respond to conventional first line non-operative interventions to guide further diagnosis and intervention. Thus, the inclusion of only patients who underwent MRI assessment of joint pathology does necessarily introduce a selection bias towards those patients whose symptomology and treatment response (though not necessarily objective disease pathology) justify additional cross-sectional imaging. It would simply not be possible to provide MRI scanning to all patients presenting with TMD symptoms in the interests of equitable resource allocation and in the interests of not exposing patients to unnecessary investigation. In any event, it is the authors’ opinion that the findings of this study reflect the TMD population more generally and that this selection bias does not detract from the validity of the analyses.
Conclusions
The relationship between specific radiological diagnoses, pain and mental health indices in TMD remains unclear. Past psychiatric history and pain remain the strongest predictors of risk of anxiety and depression. Female gender and symptoms of clicking, locking or unilateral symptoms are predictive of joint pathology on MRI. Based on the results of the current study, it may be reasonable to consider MRI in those patients reporting unilateral symptoms, joint locking and clicking, given the association between these features and objective joint pathology on imaging, in order to direct further management.

TMD is influenced by a range of biological, psychological, and social factors, with known risk factors including female gender, age between 20 and 40 years, existing mental health issues, and other chronic pain conditions. The retrospective study analyzed 202 patients from a single maxillofacial clinic who underwent MRI of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) between April 2016 and August 2019 after failing first‐line non-operative treatments. All participants completed the IMPARTS questionnaire, which assessed pain (using the Brief Pain Inventory), anxiety (via the GAD-7), and depression (via the PHQ-9).

MRI findings were classified into normal joints, anterior disc displacement with reduction (ADDWR), anterior disc displacement without reduction (ADDWOR), and severe degenerative changes. Statistical analyses, including one-way ANOVA and logistic regression, revealed that worst pain scores and a history of mental illness were significant predictors of both anxiety and depression. Interestingly, while female gender, unilateral joint symptoms, and clinical features such as clicking and locking were strongly associated with abnormal MRI findings, higher anxiety scores were paradoxically linked to normal joint morphology, suggesting that myofascial TMD may play a role.

The findings underscore the complexity of TMD, highlighting that subjective pain and mental health status do not consistently correlate with objective joint pathology on MRI. The authors advocate for the use of MRI in patients exhibiting specific clinical signs (unilateral symptoms, clicking, and locking) to aid in diagnosis and guide more targeted management, while also emphasizing the need for clinicians to monitor mental health irrespective of imaging results.","This research paper investigates the complex interplay of clinical symptoms, mental health, and MRI findings in patients with Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction (TMD).

The study found a high prevalence of anxiety and depression within the TMD cohort, with past psychiatric history and worst pain being significant predictors of both. Interestingly, the severity of pain did not correlate with specific MRI findings. However, female gender, unilateral joint symptoms, clicking, and locking were significantly associated with abnormal joint pathology on MRI, whereas increased anxiety levels and male gender were associated with normal MRI findings.

The authors concluded that mental health and pain contribute significantly to the patient experience of TMD and should be accounted for. Furthermore, clinical symptoms like clicking, locking, and unilateral symptoms, rather than anxiety symptoms, may be better predictors of detectable joint pathology on MRI. They suggest that MRI could be considered in patients with these specific clinical presentations, to guide further management.","This study investigates the relationship between temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD), mental health, and MRI findings in 202 patients referred to a maxillofacial clinic.

As a result, the fractures in this transition zone have a special pattern, posing a challenge for surgeons whether to use one miniplate versus two miniplates, as per Champy's recommendations. The commonest complication resulting to treat this area is mental nerve paraesthesia due to the dissection and stretching of the nerve. Hence, an in vitro research study of a newly designed ?Zeta? miniplate is performed, to evaluate the biomechanical behaviour using finite element (FE) analysis and biomechanical analysis along with a comparison study with the conventional miniplate configurations. The results showed that the Zeta miniplate produces the lowest stresses 17.511¬†MPa and the least total structural deformation of 0.0011¬†mm after applying the maximum occlusal bite force. On application of torsional load, total structural deformation was 0.0004¬†mm and von Mises (VM) stress value was 0.24¬†MPa which was lowest when compared with the two miniplate system. Hence, the newly developed Zeta miniplate is superior in terms of stability. Another benefit of its design is that it helps in preventing mental nerve paraesthesia and tooth root damage while fixing and stabilising the fractured bony segments.","Introduction
Mandible fractures at the parasymphysis level are common, accounting for around 20% of all mandibular fractures.1 Two anterior transitional zones are identified as vertical bands in the width of the adjoining interdental spaces, lying along the contour of the canine roots. The anterior transitional zone is 5 mm in front of the mental foramen in the case of an edentulous jaw.2 The delineation of these anterior transitional zones makes it easier to locate fractures within the symphysis region depending on whether they extend into these zones or across to an adjacent region.
Anatomically, the transition zone is characterised by the presence of more profound roots, neurovascular bundle, associated mental foramen, a shift in the thickness and orientation of the bony trabeculae that contribute to a unique clinical picture and, as a result, a unique pattern of fractures in this zone, demanding a specific management strategy.
Fractures in the transition zone thus represent a special pattern that creates a dilemma for surgeons – whether to use multiple miniplates as per Champy’s guidelines or use one miniplate for fixation. In addition, complications like mental nerve paraesthesia or anaesthesia (58%) are common due to dissection and traction of the mental nerve in this region.3
The present study uses a novel design optimisation using modern finite element (FE) simulation techniques to optimise a new miniplate for fractures of the transitional zone and will have a similar advantage of Champy’s lines of osteosynthesis with minimal use of hardware and decreased chances of injury to tooth root apices and mental nerve.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of the newly designed ‘Zeta’ miniplate in terms of structural deformation and production of equivalent von Mises stresses, and to compare it with the two miniplates system using finite element analysis and biomechanical analysis.
Material and methods
Construction of the finite element model of the mandible
The three-dimensional finite element geometry of the mandibular bone was obtained from the Sawbones mandible models (Pacific Research Laboratories Inc) using the software Creo version 2.0. (PTC) and assembled using an educational software application (SolidWorks 2020, Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Corp). The geometry data were imported into a generally accepted, and commercially available, finite element model program, ANSYS 18.2, (ANSYS Inc). The objective of this study focused on intraoral stability so, in our FE modelling, the anatomical specifications for the mandible were simplified by not considering the teeth. The bone was considered to have isotropic, homogeneous, and linearly elastic characteristics. The average values were acquired based on previously published data and were attained using Young’s modulus (E) and Poisson’s ratio (ν) of the cortical bone (E = 13:3 GPa, ν = 0:224), and cancellous bone (E = 1:33 GPa, ν = 0:224).4
Construction of finite element model of titanium plates with screws
The geometry of the miniplates and screws was obtained from the manufacturer-provided information of the commercially available product (Ortho Max® Manufacturing Company Pvt). The miniplates and screws are made up of titanium (Grades II & V). The three dimensions and specifications of the two miniplate system (2 mm and 2.5 mm system) and Zeta titanium miniplate (2 mm system in upper arm and 2.5 mm system in lower arm with 1.5 mm thickness) were reconstructed and assembled using an educational software application (SolidWorks 2020, Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Corp), and three-dimensional models of the miniplates along with the screws were created with exact geometry (Fig. 1). Material properties for titanium were assigned as 117 GPa for Young modulus and 0.33 for Poisson ratio (strain limit-0.2%) acquired based on previously published data.4 The fracture site in the transition zone of the parasymphysis–body region was defined, and different miniplate systems were applied according to Champy's clinical protocol. The integrated model was imported into the FE package (ANSYS 18.2, ANSYS Inc). The model was constructed equivalent to the real shape and size of the mandible, and an xyz coordinate system was assigned to the model such that the x direction was medio-lateral, the y direction was anteroposterior, and the z direction was superoinferior.

Boundary conditions
After the mesh models were generated, the major muscle forces were applied, including masseter, temporalis, and pterygoid muscle forces, to simulate the occlusal force of 660 N + 480 N + 300 N + 290 N = 1730 N and mylohyoid, geniohyoid, genioglossus, and digastric muscle force to simulate torsional force of 500 N was applied simultaneously over the occlusal surface of the FE model, keeping the condylar and coronoid processes fixed5 (Fig. 2). The maximum occlusal force that can be loaded in a mandible was taken to measure the biomechanical changes in the miniplates as well as the hosting bone, even though normal functional occlusal forces without any fracture of the mandible, as well as in fractured mandible cases, are far less. With an adequate and simplified geometric finite element model and the appropriate material properties, along with the highest occlusal loading and support conditions, the finite element solver module of the ANSYS 18.2 software carried out the mathematical procedure, and displacement and stress values for each node as well as element were obtained.

In vitro biomechanical experiments
Osteotomy
All polyurethane replicas of human mandibles were evenly split along the mandibular parasymphysis-body region between the mandibular canine and premolar to the base of the mandible, simulating a fracture in the transition zone. To do this, a diamond disk coupled to a handpiece was used. The samples were divided into two groups of five mandibles each and fixed with two different miniplates according to the experimental groups.
Placement of two miniplates and Zeta miniplate
Two possible orientations were used for the bone plate fixation. The Zeta miniplate group involved using a four-hole single miniplate on the osteotomy site with two holes on each side. The plate was placed parallel to the lower mandible border and 2–3 mm below the mental foramen. The two miniplates group used a pair of four-hole straight plates, four holes with gap (2 mm) on superior border and four holes with gap (2.5 mm) on inferior border of mandible. The screws were inserted perpendicularly.
In vitro biomechanical experiments
Ten Sawbones mandible models (Pacific Research Laboratories Inc) were divided into two miniplates and Zeta miniplate groups for the biomechanical study. Based on the study done by Vieira e Oliveira et al, both condyles of the Sawbones mandible were fixed on the device.6 The Universal Testing Machine (UTM System Co) was used to apply the force on the mandible canine to produce a vertical axial load. (Fig. 3) The preload was set to 10 N at the rate of 1 mm/min until the mandible model/fixation failed. The failure load value and fixation failure patterns were recorded.

Results
Total structural deformation
Results indicated that the total static structural deformation for the newly designed Zeta miniplate after applying vertical axial load was 0.0011 mm and for the two-miniplate configuration, it was 1.3628 mm whereas on the application of torsional load, total structural deformation for the newly designed Zeta miniplate was 0.0004 mm while for the two miniplate configurations it was 0.066 mm (Fig. 4).

Equivalent von-Mises stresses
The results showed that the Zeta miniplate produced – 17.511 MPa – on the application of vertical axial loading while the maximum stress was generated by the two-miniplate system was 86.510 MPa whereas the VM stress value for the Zeta miniplate was 0.24 MPa at torsional loading which was lowest when compared with the two miniplate configuration, 25.05 MPa (Fig. 5).

Results of the in vitro biomechanical test
The findings of the in vitro biomechanical tests are shown in Figure 6. With the two miniplate system, all the Sawbones mandible models broke in the region of the proximal segment (mean failure load: 121.47 N) with plates deformation. With the Zeta miniplate system, all the five models resisted fracture (mean load: 83.47 N) and there were no plate and screw failures.

Discussion
Because of dynamic biomechanics, the behaviour of diverse patterns of stresses, and the forces applied in the transition zone of the body and parasymphysis of the mandible, there is always a dilemma for surgeons between using one or two miniplates to fix the fractured segments of the mandible. Additionally, the presence of the mental nerve in this transition zone, makes it more challenging for surgeons to fix the fracture segments without dissecting and injuring the nerve. The purpose of this study was to overcome this issue, for which a novel Zeta miniplate has been designed.
The biomechanical behaviour of this newly-developed miniplate was evaluated using finite element analysis, and it was found to be superior in terms of stability and stress distribution. On application of maximum occlusal loads and maximum torsional pressures, the structural deformation of the Zeta miniplate was the lowest of the studies, and it also produced the lowest equivalent VM stresses. As a result, the yielding of the fixation units under load was reduced, and any micromovements in the fracture segments, miniplate/screws, and related bone were limited. This more rigid fixation should result in faster and more reliable healing.
Another mechanical advantage of this unique design is the equal and even distribution of the vector forces, loads, and stresses across the three arms. As a result, stresses along the upper arm of the Zeta are evenly distributed by passing it to the lower arm of the miniplate through the vertical arm, which resists even the micromovement of the fracture segments. The broad vertical arm plays an important role in resisting the stresses along the upper and lower arms of the miniplate.
An interesting characteristic of this miniplate is its novel design, one size, and fixation of the fracture segments using a minimum of four screws, two on each side of the fracture segment, in a single Zeta miniplate which reduces the extra hardware such as an extra miniplate and screws. To achieve equivalent outcomes, the miniplate can be positioned at the exact location of the fracture line.
As per Boole et al, fractures of the mandible at the level of the parasymphysis, extending obliquely and through the transitional zone to the body area, are the most common. In this study, the author recommends the use of Zeta miniplate in cases of simple linear and oblique fractures.1
Nerve injury can occur as a result of original trauma during surgical exposure/flap retraction or maybe during manipulation of fracture segments. Song et al documented adverse neurosensory changes in the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and mental nerve (MN) following surgical treatment for mandibular fractures, reporting that the IAN/MN neurosensory status worsened in 13% of cases and that MN injury was more common (58%) when two-plate fixation was used.3
Iatrogenic nerve damage can be reduced by skeletonisation of the nerve and placement of plates above or below the canal. The additional advantage of the newly designed Zeta miniplate includes preservation of the mental nerve during the plating procedure and, because the Zeta miniplate bypasses the mental nerve/foramen, placement of the miniplate and fixation of fractured segments are therefore atraumatic. Although inappropriate soft tissue management may induce neurosensory problems, the Zeta miniplate can be inserted into the inframental foramen region with a gentle reflection of the periosteum.
There are two limitations of this study:
1.        
There are some inherent limitations in the finite element model/analysis due to its geometrical simplification, material characteristic features, and boundary conditions.7
2.        
The analysis cannot consider any other anatomical variations of the mandible or fractures.
From the biomechanical perspective, the finite element analysis and an in vitro biomechanical test led to the conclusion that the new miniplate is better in terms of stability and in terms of resisting the torsional forces. Further in vivo clinical trials of Zeta miniplate need to be done to evaluate its handling properties, in terms of occlusion, stability of the miniplate and fractured fragments, operating time, ease of use, surgical access, and, most importantly, mental nerve paraesthesia and injury to tooth root apices.

Fractures in this region often extend into anterior transitional zones near the canine roots, where complex anatomy—featuring deeper roots, a neurovascular bundle, and the mental foramen—creates a unique fracture pattern. This complexity poses a surgical dilemma: whether to use multiple miniplates according to Champy’s guidelines or to employ a single plate while minimizing complications such as mental nerve paraesthesia, which is reported in up to 58% of cases.

To resolve these issues, the researchers designed a novel “Zeta” miniplate optimized for the transitional zone. They evaluated its biomechanical performance using finite element (FE) simulation and in vitro experiments, comparing it with the conventional two-miniplate system. A three-dimensional finite element model of the mandible was constructed from Sawbones data using software including Creo, SolidWorks, and ANSYS. The model, simplified by excluding teeth and assuming isotropic, homogeneous, and linear elastic bone properties, was subjected to simulated occlusal forces (1730 N) and torsional forces (500 N). The titanium Zeta miniplate, featuring a unique three-arm design and requiring only four screws, demonstrated significantly lower structural deformation (0.0011 mm vertically and 0.0004 mm under torsion) and reduced equivalent von Mises stresses compared to the two-plate configuration.

In vitro biomechanical tests with polyurethane mandible replicas confirmed that the Zeta miniplate resisted fracture without plate or screw failure. These findings suggest that the Zeta miniplate offers improved stability and a reduced risk of nerve injury, although further clinical trials are required for in vivo validation.","This study investigates a novel ""Zeta"" miniplate design for fixing parasymphysis mandible fractures in the anterior transitional zone, an area prone to complications like mental nerve injury.

Reconstructive surgery of the head and neck region aims to restore anatomical and functional structures that have been damaged as a result of a malformation, surgical resection, or trauma. Microsurgery was a breakthrough in head and neck reconstruction and microvascular flaps are currently the gold standard of care in reconstruction.1,2 The main bone free flaps used in maxillofacial reconstruction are the fibular free flap (FFF),3 the deep circumflex iliac artery flap (DCIA),4 and the scapular bone flap (SBF).5 Although flap harvesting has been widely described,6–16 given the recent and increasing use of the scapular flap, no comparison of the indications and donor site morbidity among these three flaps has been performed. In this study flap-related donor site morbidity was analysed in patients undergoing head and neck hard tissue reconstruction in our institute.
Material and methods
Medical records of patients who underwent hard tissue head and neck reconstruction performed by the same team in the Oncological and Reconstructive Maxillofacial Surgery Unit of Umberto I General Hospital in Rome, Italy between 2011 and 2021 were analysed retrospectively. Inclusion criteria were complete clinical and radiological documentation, harvest of a SBF, FFF, or DCIA flap, and a minimum follow up of 12 months. Data on demographic characteristics, age, sex, site, aetiology, reconstruction techniques, and complications were collected. The donor site complications considered included both symptoms reported by the patient and signs detected by the surgeon. Complications were subdivided into general complications and those specifically linked to flap harvesting. All patients completed the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL). All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 28.0.1.1, IBM Corp). Correlations were analysed using independent-samples t tests. The results reported include the 99% confidence interval (CI), 5% margin of error (ME), and statistical significance (p < 0.05).
Results
At the end of the medical record review, 220 patients met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. There were 139 males (63.2%) and 81 females (36.8%), with a mean age of 59.1 years. The data on demographics, reconstructive site, and aetiology for each individual flap are shown in Table 1. As complications, in DCIA flaps there was dysaesthesia of the thigh due to injury of the cutaneous lateral femoral nerve in 14 (13.6%) patients, abdominal hernias in three (2.9%), surgical wound dehiscence, donor site infection, and anterior superior iliac spine fracture in two patients each (1.9%), and saphenous vein thrombosis in one (0.9%) (Fig. 1). Of the three patients (2.9%) who underwent anastomotic revision, two flaps remained trophic, while one flap failed and was replaced with a pedicle pectoralis major muscle flap and reconstructive plate. Of the 87 patients who underwent FFF reconstruction, donor site morbidity included dehiscence in seven patients (8%), with skin graft loss seen in six (6.9%), donor site infection in five (5.7%), leg dysaesthesia in three (3.4%), and tendon exposure in one patient (1.1%). The anastomosis was revised in two patients (2.3%). Of the 30 patients with SBF reconstruction, seroma occurred in four (13.3%) and dehiscence in two (6.7%) (Fig. 1). The average total UW-QOL score was 71.22; the subscale average scores were 69.7 for pain, 66.26 for appearance, 72.78 for activities, 68.63 for swallowing, 74.05 for chewing, 66.57 for speech, 62.87 for mood, and 69.34 for anxiety. Table 2 summarises the mean values of the subscales divided by each flap. There was a statistically significant difference in the activity parameter for SBF compared with FFF and DCIA (p<0.05) while the other subscales were not statistically significantly different (p>0.05). In terms of perceived quality of life, the categories were excellent, very good, good, fair, poor, and very poor. The rating was very good for 37 patients (17%), good for 94 (43%), fair for 60 (27%), and poor for 29 (13%). No patient had excellent or very poor ratings. There was a significant difference in postoperative dehiscence between FFF patients versus DCIA flap and SBF patients (p < 0.05); the rate of dysaesthesia was significantly higher in DCIA flap patients compared with SBF and FFF patients (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2). The patients in whom an SBF was harvested were significantly older (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the infection or flap failure rate among the flap groups (p > 0.05).

Discussion
In head and neck surgery, microsurgical reconstruction of three-dimensional defects after tumour removal, trauma, or malformations poses several technical challenges.7 Since its introduction by Taylor et al in 1975,3 FFF has often been considered the best flap for maxillary bone reconstruction (Fig. 3) with low complications, although Momoh et al reported a complication rate of 31.2%.8 Computed tomography of the lower limbs should be requested to check for significant peripheral obliterating arteriopathies. The latter can also be used for computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture (CAD/CAM) planning. A 2012 systematic review showed frequency of acute and long-term complications ranged from 1.07% to 19.0%.9 Surgical skin wound FFF donor site closure is extremely controversial. Some believe that defect < 6 cm wide can be closed directly, while others believe that primary closure is possible only with a defect < 4 cm.10–11 Regarding skin graft, the dressing is removed on the fifth day postoperatively achieving complete healing in about 20 days; with dermal substitutes, the silicone membrane is removed between the 17th and 21st postoperative day. FFF is extremely reliable, and quick to harvest with an average time range of 70 to 90 minutes, however we reserve it for complex reconstructions. Sanders first described DCIA flaps in 19794 and in 1989, Urken et al12 reported their experience with DCIA flaps for oromandibular reconstructions. The DCIA flap has been increasingly recognised for its efficacy due to the large amount of bone (Fig. 4). However, harvesting this flap may require more experience than FFF and a longer operating time ranging from 90 to 180 minutes depending on the surgeon’s expertise. A CT scan of the pelvis is recommended in the preparatory phase so that the vascular axis can be studied and, if necessary, a CAD/CAM sampling can be planned. The most feared early complications are haemorrhage and peritonitis. Neither of these complications was recorded in our patient cohort. There are three main complications to prevent: dysaesthesia due to dissection of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve; anterior-superior iliac spinal fractures; and abdominal hernia. An absolute contraindication is related to previous inguinal or abdominal hernia plastic surgery or appendectomy, by virtue of fibrocystic alteration of the abdominal wall and possible damage to the vascular pedicle. Two relative contraindications are first, women who have given birth by caesarean section (even though Fisher and Batstone reported two women who had a normal pregnancies with caesarean deliveries without subsequent abdominal herniations). Secondly, patients with at least grade I obesity (BMI > 30) that increases the risk of iatrogenic abdominal hernia due to intrabdominal pressure as well as also the risk of fracture of the iliac spine are contraindicated also.14 Meticulous reconstruction of the abdominal wall minimises the risk of abdominal hernia. We usually reconstruct the entire internal oblique muscle with polyethylene mesh and reinforce the wall with an underlying suture between the transverse and internal oblique muscles, and superiorly with external oblique muscle-gluteus medius suture. Furthermore, we recommended preservation of the anterior-superior iliac spine for a better cosmetic result and reduced postoperative pain.15,16 Over the past decade, SBF has been increasingly recognised as a viable alternative to FFF and DCIA. The subscapular arterial system enables the creation of chimeric flaps. From the subscapular artery, with an almost constant branching, one can set up the latissimus dorsi muscle-cutaneous flap based on the thoracodorsal artery and flank this with a scapular tip, supplied by the angular artery, and/or the lateral scapular bone based on the circumflex artery of the scapula. A preoperative CT study is sufficient to analyse the scapular shape and the amount of bone to be harvested. The anatomy is almost constant and harvest requires an average time of 90-120 minutes. In our centre, the two surgical teams work simultaneously, which, in our opinion, saves additional time. The patient is positioned supine with an elevated support at the ipsilateral pelvis. In this way, the scapula is slightly raised and easier to approach (Fig. 4). The most difficult point may be the dissection of the scapular bone, which is facilitated by pulling the tip of the scapula outwards with Backhaus forceps. Numerous articles have shown its efficacy, reproducibility, and low cost in relation to the donor site.17 Functionally, a significant reduction in shoulder strength and external rotation have been reported, but this did not affect the patients’ perceived quality of life.18 In our series, dehiscence occurred in 6.7% of cases, while seroma occurred in 13.6%. Moreover, after harvesting this flap, gait is resumed quickly, often on the first postoperative day, which is particularly useful in the elderly; indeed, the average age of our SBF patients was significantly higher than FFF and DCIA patients (p<0,05). As for vascular anastomosis, the authors prefer to perform it on the isolated facial artery and vein (>80% of cases) through a submandibular incision generally used for neck dissection. Temporal artery and vein, superior thyroid artery, external jugular vein, common thyroid-lingual facial trunk, and internal jugular vein could be alternatives. Except for the venous anastomosis on the internal jugular vein performed termino-laterally, the authors prefer to perform termino-terminal anastomoses. Pedicles of the FFF and SBF do not create any problems with regard to their length, whereas when an attempt is made to lengthen the pedicle of the DCIA flap, the authors recommend performing the first osteotomy more lateral and away the anterosuperior iliac spine. We focussed on the amount of bone reliable among the different bone flaps and the consequent chance of prosthetics. From the latter point of view, 44.37% (49.53 FFF; 44.78 DCIA; 38.8 SBF) of the patients’ cohort underwent implant-prosthetic rehabilitation. The percentage being so low is related to two factors: the first is due to malignant diseases, the authors prefer to perform the implant procedure six months after the end of radiotherapy; the second is related of the strict criteria of subsidisation of implant-prosthetic material by the Italian regional health system. Implant survival stands at an average value of 81.61% (82.4% in FFF, 84.18% in DCIA and 78.27 in SBF) and will be the subject of subsequent more in-depth studies.

Summarising concepts presented so far, authors prefer DCIA flaps for unilateral reconstructions of the jaw that do not cross the midline and where a moderate amount of soft tissue is needed. The patient can be mobilised 48 hours (h) after surgery, while from the gait point of view they have to use crutches for twenty days without loading the weight on the operated side. The FFF remains an excellent flap in complex reconstructions of the maxilla that extend beyond the midline, in cases requiring multiple osteotomies (which the authors do not prefer to perform on DCIA flaps and SBF), and in cases where, as in salvage surgery, the neck is depleted of vessels and a very long vascular pedicle is needed. Similarly, to the DCIA flap, mobilisation starts 48h after surgery. Placement of a brace is recommended and loading on the leg is discouraged for 15 days. The SBF is an excellent flap to use in selected cases, where the quantity and quality of the bone are not comparable to those of the DCIA flap and FFF. We prefer to use it in older patients in whom early gait is desired, generally in first postoperative day, and in patients needing complex three-dimensional reconstructions that requires high degrees of freedom between components. In any case, for all three types of flaps, we recommend a visit and a possible 30-day physical therapy course with our physiotherapy colleagues.
Conclusion
This study compared donor site morbidity among the fibular, iliac crest, and scapular flaps. The analysis of our 10-year case series revealed that all three flaps were safe and associated with low donor site morbidity. The main differences were related to dysaesthesia in DCIA flaps and dehiscence in FFF. Overall, the complication rates are very low and clinically manageable. No flap was objectively superior to the others, and each has its own peculiarities, advantages, and disadvantages. These data underline the importance of choosing the right flap for each patient based on their clinical and reconstructive characteristics.

Conducted at Umberto I General Hospital in Rome between 2011 and 2021, the study reviewed 220 patient records meeting strict inclusion criteria including complete clinical and radiological documentation and a minimum follow‐up of 12 months. Data on patient demographics, reconstruction techniques, aetiology, and flap-related complications—both general and donor site-specific—were collected, while quality of life was measured using the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL).

Results indicated that overall donor site morbidity was low across all flap types, although distinct differences were observed. DCIA flaps exhibited a higher incidence of thigh dysaesthesia (13.6%) along with complications such as abdominal hernias, wound dehiscence, and other rare events. FFF procedures were more prone to donor site dehiscence (8%), skin graft failures (6.9%), and infections, whereas SBF cases, performed in an older patient cohort, demonstrated seroma (13.3%) and dehiscence (6.7%). Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences in activity parameters and specific complication rates among the groups.

The study concludes that each flap technique has unique advantages and drawbacks. Selection should be individualized based on patient characteristics and reconstructive requirements, ensuring an optimal balance between functional recovery and aesthetic outcome in head and neck reconstruction. These findings underscore the need to tailor flap selection to individual profiles, enhancing surgical outcomes and long-term quality of life.","This retrospective study analyzed donor site morbidity in 220 patients who underwent head and neck reconstruction with fibular free flaps (FFF), deep circumflex iliac artery flaps (DCIA), or scapular bone flaps (SBF) between 2011 and 2021.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are the most common cause of non-dental orofacial pain, affecting approximately 10%–15% of the general population, with a peak incidence in adults aged 20 to 40 years.1 TMDs are defined as a group of conditions in which one or more of the structures comprising the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) are affected, namely the muscles of mastication and the articular disc and/or the bone itself. The muscle disorders, myalgia and myofascial pain, form the largest subgroup of TMD (approximately 80%).2 Myofascial pain specifically relates to pain and limitation of jaw function that originates from the masticatory muscles.
A patient with myofascial TMD can present with acute and chronic forms of orofacial muscle pain. Acute muscle spasms usually result from increased inflammation of the masticatory muscles, most commonly the masseters, where the muscle is strained, fatigued, or injured. This results in severe jaw pain, redness, enlargement of the muscle (hypertrophy), severe tightness, and limited jaw function. The most common causes of acute masseter muscle spasm are bruxism (awake and nocturnal), increased stress, and trauma. Chronic myofascial pain is a long-term, more persistent pain condition with a likely neuropathic element and, like all chronic pain conditions, is associated with multiple comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, and fibromyalgia, among others.3
First-line treatment of myofascial TMD includes early diagnosis, explanation and education, and conservative self-care measures, such as therapeutic massage with heat or cold packs, a soft diet during flare-ups, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen in topical and tablet formulations and, where clinically appropriate, the use of occlusal splint therapy.1
Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) is becoming widely used in the management of many medical and surgical conditions, especially musculoskeletal pain disorders.4 It is now being used increasingly as an adjunct to conservative management of TMD, namely in the muscle disorders subgroup, due to its muscle-relaxant and analgesic properties.5
For specialists undertaking BTX-A treatment in the management of myofascial TMD, clinical experience appears to support the notion that BTX-A produces significant clinical benefits. However, the scientific evidence regarding this is conflicting, and it has been suggested that there is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of BTX-A, and that any improvement it produces is of minimal clinical relevance in TMD patient groups.5,6
The treatment of TMD is complex and it is well reported that psychological intervention is a fundamental part of its management, as biopsychosocial factors are important in the aetiology. In view of this, perhaps the most valuable outcome measures with which to analyse the impact of BTX-A on myofascial TMD are patient-reported outcomes.
To assess the effectiveness of masseteric BTX-A in the management of temporomandibular myofascial pain, we present a mixed methods analysis of our local TMD-myofascial pain cohort who underwent BTX-A injections.
Our primary aim was to investigate the effectiveness of BTX-A masseteric injections on patient-reported pain levels and quality of life (QoL) scores, while also comparing its effectiveness with other management strategies for myofascial TMD.
To our knowledge, this study is the largest evaluation conducted in the UK to date on the use of masseteric BTX-A injections for the management of myofascial TMD.
Method
The oral surgery department provides a tertiary service for the diagnosis and management of patients with TMD. All patients undergo thorough history-taking and appropriate investigations to aid in the diagnosis of TMD, as defined by the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD).7 All patients are initially given advice on conservative management with the aid of a locally developed patient education video (Fig. 1) and are offered an onward referral to our local physiotherapy team. Patients who fail to respond to conservative measures with or without physiotherapy are reviewed in a specialist TMD clinic. Here, those with a diagnosis of TMD-myofascial pain alone, combination TMD with a component of TMD-myofascial pain, and those with a query TMD-myofascial pain, are offered a trial of BTX-A masseteric injections. A detailed informed consent process is carried out for each patient.

All those deemed suitable for BTX-A injections are added to a local registry. A review of the registry identified 313 patients who had received BTX-A injections between 2019 and 2024.
Intervention protocol
All BTX-A injections were initially performed by one clinician (between 2019 and 2022) and over time two additional clinicians were trained to provide them using the same clinical protocol and injection technique. The BTX-A brand, Xeomin® (Merz Pharma) was used and 100 units of BTX-A were reconstituted with 1 ml sterile saline. A maximum dose of 50 units per side was injected along the inferior portion of the mandible, with 10 units being delivered at each injection site and a maximum of five injections per masseter muscle.
Follow up was arranged at four months, but in reality this varied, with most patients being reviewed between 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Follow up was done via video, telephone, or face-to-face appointment.
Data collection
All prospective data were collected during routine clinic/treatment visits, while retrospective data were collected by contacting patients postoperatively using a standardised pro forma.
The following information was recorded for each patient using the standardised operative records:
-        
Patient demographics
-        
Diagnosis: TMD - myofascial pain/myalgia
-        
Additional relevant comments, for example, combination TMD (myogenous and arthrogenous components) or relevant comorbidities such as migraine, fibromyalgia, orofacial pain, hypermobility disorders
-        
Site of injection, number of units given (per side), and interval between treatments
-        
Patient self-reported average pain scores, using a visual analogue scale (VAS) numerical pain rating score out of 10 (0 =no pain, 10 = maximum pain), before and after treatment
-        
Patient self-reported quality of life (QoL) impact score, using a numerical QoL rating score out of 10 (0 =no impact, 10 = maximum impact) before and after treatment
-        
Any intraoperative and postoperative complications
Statistical analysis
Non-parametric tests were used for all analyses. Pain scores were summarised as a mean before and after a round of treatment, and were tested using paired samples t tests.
Results
Of the 313 patients identified on the registry, the data on 183 patients with clinically diagnosed myofascial TMD were collected both prospectively and retrospectively. Following exclusions, including patients lost to follow up, patients declining to participate in the study, and those who did not wish to proceed with the treatment, the final cohort comprised 149 patients.
A total of 149 patients completed one round of masseteric BTX-A treatment, and 61 of them completed two rounds. Associated medical conditions included anxiety (33%), chronic inflammatory conditions (13%), chronic pain conditions (8%), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (3%), and a history of head and neck cancer (2%). All patients in the study had signs and/or symptoms of bruxism (awake and/or nocturnal).
The mean (range) age was 40 (20-81) years, with a strong predilection for females (female to male ratio 6:1). Sixty-one of the 149 patients had more than one course of injections. In total, 398 masseter muscles were injected. After the first course of treatment 42 patients (28%) reported that mouth opening had increased, 77 (58%) reported no change, and 30 (20%) reported that it was reduced.
The mean VAS pain score preoperatively was 8/10, compared with a postoperative mean score of 3/10 at six weeks after treatment (mean percentage reduction in pain 50%).
Pain scores were classified as mild (≤4), moderate (≥5 to ≤7), or severe (≥8). Pain scores and QoL scores improved considerably more in the severe pain group than in the mild group, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. Complete resolution of symptoms was reported in 21% of patients (n = 31). The mean VAS-reported impact on QoL score was 8/10, and showed improvement postoperatively (mean score 3/10) (Tables 1 and 2).

A paired samples t test was conducted to compare pain scores. There was a significant difference in the preoperative (M = 7.96, SD = 1.668) and postoperative pain scores (M = 2.96, SD = 2.541) (t(5) = 2.927, p < 0.001).
Statistical analysis showed significant improvement in QoL after administration of injections preoperatively (M = 8.36, SD = 1.79) and postoperatively (M = 3.11 SD = 2.954) (t(5.25) = 3.198, p < 0.001). These results suggest a significant reduction in pain and improvement in QoL. Symptom improvement was found to last a mean (range) of five (0–26) months. Sixty-five per cent of patients found that BTX-A was the most effective treatment modality in comparison with conservative measures and lower bite raising appliances.
Two patients did not experience symptom relief or any improvement after treatment. Of those with no improvement, degeneration of the disc was suspected (combination TMD) as described in the Discussion.
On review, no postoperative complications were reported, but some side effects included postoperative pain, limited mouth opening, and transient difficulty with eating.
Discussion
The principal finding in this study was that BTX-A was effective in the management of TMD-myofascial pain.
BTX-A is a synthesised neurotoxin derived from the rod-shaped, spore-forming bacterium Clostridium botulinum. When this exotoxin is released it blocks the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the pre-synaptic cholinergic nerve endings, which results in inactivity of the post-synaptic muscles or glands that are being innervated. When injected into a muscle it therefore produces a semi-permanent partial paralysis.
Since its first medical use to treat strabismus in the 1970s and 80s, the primary clinical use of BTX-A has been as a therapeutic agent in the management of neuromuscular disorders. Recognition of its cosmetic effects started in the early 2000s and grew exponentially.8 As its clinical use started to expand even further, pain-relieving effects were observed and it is now being used in the management of many medical and surgical conditions, especially musculoskeletal pain disorders. In addition, there is evidence that it has the ability to create an antinociceptive effect by blocking the release of inflammatory mediators, such as substance P.9,10 In view of its multiple properties, BTX-A is increasingly being used to manage a wide range of conditions including headache, cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, bruxism, and TMD.11
With its ability to reduce muscle activity and its pain-relieving effects, there is increasing evidence to support its benefits in the management of TMD, specifically myofascial pain.12–14 It is this evidence that guided our decision to use BTX-A in the management of TMD-myosfascial pain in our unit.
Based on our findings, the use of BTX-A in the management of TMD-myofascial pain has been hugely beneficial for patients, significantly reducing average pain scores from an initial 7.9 (8/10) to 2.9 (3/10). This statistically significant finding is in stark contrast to several clinical trials in which the efficacy of BTX-A injections has not yet been established.6,15 We postulate that one reason for this could be the large differences in the clinical diagnostic criteria used. Multiple diagnostic criteria exist for TMD and, as our study demonstrates, BTX-A may be ineffective when true TMD-myofascial pain is not the primary source of the symptoms. Furthermore, the inclusion of such cases in the final analyses might dilute the effect size of this treatment, and potentially lead to trial outcomes being misinterpreted as failures when, in fact, a sub-group analysis would suggest significant benefits on pain scores.16,17
On comparing the impact of BTX-A masseteric injections on pain management, it has become apparent that patients reporting higher initial pain scores experienced more pronounced pain reduction. One possible explanation for this is that individuals with greater baseline pain levels may have heightened sensitivity to the analgesic effects of BTX-A, resulting in a more substantial alleviation of symptoms. These patients also may have had more severe muscular tension or dysfunction at the outset, making them particularly responsive to its muscle-relaxing properties. Further investigation into the underlying mechanisms that are driving this correlation could provide valuable insights into optimising treatment strategies for TMD-myofascial pain.
It is worth noting that where patients reported ‘mild’ initial pain scores, the treatment decision to proceed with BTX-A was driven by those who reported that their TMD had a significant impact on their QoL. Within this study, two patients reported initial preoperative pain scores of ≤4/10 (mild), however, their scores for impact on QoL were 10/10 and 6/10. Beyond the significant reduction in pain scores reported, the use of BTX-A also significantly reduced the impact of patients’ TMD on their QoL from an initial average score of 8.3 to 3.1.
Given the remarkable pain-relieving effects observed with BTX-A injections in the management of myofascial pain, its role has evolved beyond pain management to aid diagnosis of TMD-myofascial pain.18 BTX-A injections could be considered as a ‘diagnostic therapy’, in other words as an adjunct to differentiate between patients presenting with true TMD-myofascial pain and other diagnoses, such as TMD arthralgias or migraines, or those with other psychogenic factors.19 This explains why no improvement in pain was noted in two patients (1.3%). In these cases alternative diagnoses were explored, and therapies that were tailored to their specific conditions were considered as the next step. Interestingly, Yoshida 18 adopted a similar strategy, suggesting the use of local anaesthetic injections into muscles for patients without a clear diagnosis. The author noted that if patients responded favourably, even for a short period, they would be likely to have a positive response to BTX-A. While not trialled in our patient cohort, this could potentially provide a cheaper alternative to identify which patients are unlikely to respond to BTX-A injections when the initial diagnosis is unclear.
Our cohort's demographics generally align with existing research, which typically indicates a peak incidence of TMD-myofascial pain among adults aged 20-40 years, with a higher prevalence among females.20,21 However, a notable departure lies in our cohort's pronounced female predominance, reflected in a female to male ratio of 6:1. Moreover, our study participants tended to be older than those in previous TMD-related studies. This age difference is likely to stem from our location in central London, a cosmopolitan hub attracting patients from diverse backgrounds, and potentially skewing comparisons with other UK-based studies. Furthermore, our affiliation with a major cancer unit also exposes us to a disproportionate number of head and neck cancer patients, many of whom develop TMD-myofascial pain following cancer treatment. There is also merit in considering current management approaches in our region that support prolonged trials of conservative management, which may have led to delayed referrals and may have skewed age demographics. This argument is also supported by Yoshida who noted an older TMD-myofascial patient cohort in their unit due to conservative therapies being trialled for several years before consideration of BTX-A injections.18 Assessing symptom onset rather than age might yield results more consistent with the existing literature.
Our findings regarding the duration of pain relief were consistent with other studies, which suggest a duration of four to six months.22 Zhang et al showed that BTX-A injections reduced the maximal occlusal force exerted by the masseter muscle to the maximal value at three months post-treatment, and that it persisted below pre-treatment levels, although at six months after treatment the difference was not statistically significant.23 These findings are in line with the expected pharmacokinetics of BTX-A. While we did not collect information about the duration of onset of positive effects of BTX-A, the literature generally supports an onset time of approximately four weeks.13,24
There were no reported complications from the BTX-A injections in our cohort. However, this is in stark contrast to the findings of Göbel et al,24 who noted a high incidence of adverse events (75%) following BTX-A injections for upper back myofascial pain. Looking into the range of adverse events they reported, the most common one was muscle soreness. In our study patients were warned of the normal sequela of muscle soreness following BTX-A injections, lasting for approximately three to five days postoperatively. Hence, within our cohort, immediate and short-term muscle soreness was not classified as an adverse event but rather as a normal sequela of treatment.
Within our cohort, there were four patient-reported adverse effects (2.7%) including changes to face shape, redirection of pain, and worsening symptoms. This was slightly higher than it was in a retrospective study by Kim et al who noted the lowest incidence of adverse events following BTX-A injections for masseteric hyperplasia (1.07%) compared with other treatment indications such as wrinkles, cervical dystonia, and blepharospasm.25 In our cohort, two patients reported adverse effects with regard to changes in face shape. This is unsurprising given that BTX-A is known to cause reduced muscle thickness.15 However, it is worth noting that studies have indicated no alterations in overall volume of the mandible or in cortical thickness of the mandibular ramus following BTX-A injections.26 Muscle thickness typically returned to baseline values within 72 months, indicating the reversibility of these changes.15
One patient reported worsening of pain at other sites, in particular the temples and shoulders, following BTX-A injections to the masseter muscle. This is a known adverse effect of BTX-A injections in patients whose myofascial pain involves other muscles in the head and neck. It is likely that the resolution of pain from the jaw region heightens the perception of pain in the other muscles. Hence, in cases where multiple muscles are involved, consideration of targeting multiple muscles with BTX-A injections at the same time and/or more in-depth patient education about the changes in pain perception following treatment, is required.
The role of needling in the management of myofascial pain has sparked ongoing debate. Needling techniques can broadly be classified into two categories: dry needling, involving the insertion of needles to inactivate trigger points; and wet needling, which entails using hollow-bore needles to administer substances such as local anaesthesia, saline, or botulinum toxins into the muscle. 27–31 Some studies have shown immediate to long-term improvements in pain intensity with dry needling, suggesting the possibility of a synergistic effect when combining dry needling with BTX-A to enhance patient-reported pain scores.29
It is important to note that this study did not investigate the role of different substances used in wet needling. Further exploration into this aspect could provide valuable insights into optimising wet needling techniques for management of myofascial TMD.
We observed varying patient-reported outcomes regarding changes in mouth opening following BTX-A injections (51% of patients reported no change, 28% experienced an increase, and 20% noted a reduction). We recognise the limitations of relying on self-reported data, as it may be prone to bias. Ideally, mouth opening would have been measured objectively before and after the injections. These variable results align with a systematic review by Thambar et al,32 which found that the efficacy of BTX-A injections on maximal mouth opening was inconclusive, with some studies indicating slight improvement,33 no change,34 and worsening of opening.35 Given the absence of conclusive evidence, we do not currently support the use of BTX-A injections to improve mouth opening.
All patients in this study had signs and/or symptoms of bruxism. Bruxism, recognised as an aetiological factor in TMD, is characterised by increased activity in the muscles of mastication, and is estimated to affect up to 24% of the adult population.36 Masticatory muscle hyperactivity can also result in increased volume of the masseter muscles (masseter hypertrophy). Both myofascial TMD and bruxism involve muscle tension associated with single or multiple restricted, painful trigger points within taut muscle bands.37 As previously discussed, BTX-A acts to block communication between nerves and muscles and inhibit muscle contractions. While the impact of BTX-A on muscle activity was not measured in this study, it can be hypothesised that the pharmacokinetics of BTX-A would result in a reduction in muscle contraction, contributing to an improvement in symptoms. There is a need for more high-quality evidence in this area.
A secondary objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of BTX-A against other management strategies for myofascial TMD as reported by the patients. The responses of 126 patients were collected and 96 patients (76%) reported that BTX-A had been the most effective management strategy for their TMD compared with other treatment modalities previously utilised.
While the evidence suggests that 75%-90% of those with TMD will successfully respond to education, advice, and simple conservative treatments alone,38 it is important to recognise that conservative self-care strategies rely heavily on the compliance of the patient. Compliance varies widely, but research has suggested that the higher the initial pain score and/or degree of jaw limitation, the more compliant patients are with conservative management options.39 Compliance-related issues with surgical interventions, such as BTX-A, are negligible in comparison, so success is not dependent on compliance.
Currently, no consensus exists regarding the optimal timing for intervening with BTX-A injections for myofascial TMD. However, there is an overarching belief that these injections should be reserved for end-stage management. Our findings, however, suggest a potential for earlier intervention, especially in patients in the ‘severe’ category who report initial pain scores of ≥8/10. When conservative measures fail to alleviate TMD-myofascial pain symptoms and when symptoms significantly impact QoL, BTX-A injections could be considered earlier. Hence, the authors propose that BTX-A administration should be considered earlier in patients' treatment trajectory to provide acute pain relief. Our local observations indicate that BTX-A intervention not only facilitates immediate symptom relief but also has the potential to enhance patients' ability to engage with conservative measures effectively. Moreover, intervening during the acute phase of pain may prevent patients from transitioning into a chronic pain cycle, thereby mitigating the challenges associated with long-term pain management.40
Conclusion
Our results show that all but two of the patients reported symptom relief of varying degrees and durations from masseteric BTX-A injections, with no reported complications, and only four patients reported adverse effects. These findings add to the existing literature on the effectiveness of BTX as a relatively safe intervention in patients with myofascial TMD pain after initial conservative management has failed.
To our knowledge this is the largest study in the UK to date to assess the treatment of myofascial TMD pain with masseteric BTX-A. Whilst botulinum neurotoxin does not guarantee complete resolution of pain, it has shown a significant effect in improving symptoms and QoL within our patient cohort. BTX-A should therefore be considered as a valuable alternative treatment and, in some cases, an effective diagnostic therapy tool for myofascial TMD pain.

TMD, affecting roughly 10–15% of the population and peaking in adults aged 20–40 years (with a marked female predominance), often results in painful dysfunction of the masticatory muscles. The research, the largest of its kind in the UK, involved 149 patients who received BTX-A injections following a failed response to conservative treatments such as education, self-care, physiotherapy, NSAIDs, and occlusal splint therapy. An initial protocol administered 100 units of BTX-A (reconstituted with 1 ml sterile saline), with a maximum of 50 units per side delivered at multiple injection sites along the masseter muscle.

Patient-reported outcomes were measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and a similar scale for quality of life (QoL) impact. Preoperative mean VAS scores of 8/10 dropped significantly to 3/10 at six weeks post-treatment, with QoL scores improving from 8/10 to 3/10. Notably, patients with severe pain experienced the greatest benefit. The average duration of the therapeutic effect was approximately five months. Furthermore, 65% of patients reported that BTX-A was more effective than other management strategies, and adverse events were minimal, with no major complications reported.

The authors conclude that BTX-A is a safe and effective alternative treatment for myofascial TMD pain, offering significant pain relief and QoL improvements, and suggest considering its earlier use in the treatment trajectory for patients with severe symptoms.","This study assessed the effectiveness of Botulinum Toxin A (BTX-A) injections in the masseter muscles for treating myofascial temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in 149 patients.

Results showed a significant reduction in pain and improvement in QoL post-injection. The average pain score decreased from 7.9/10 to 2.9/10, and the average QoL impact score decreased from 8.3/10 to 3.1/10. Patients with severe initial pain reported the most significant improvement. BTX-A was deemed more effective than conservative treatments by 76% of patients. The average duration of pain relief was approximately five months.

In this pilot study we explored the experiences of, and attitudes to, briefings using a 10-question Survey Monkey. This was promoted during a human factors session at the 2023 Association of Surgeons in Training Conference (ASiT) and at a large NHS trust. Questions were asked about the number of briefings per day, attitudes, engagement, and respondents? attitudes to them. In total, 109 responses were received. A total of 85% reported at least one briefing on a normal operating day, 65% felt them to be interactive, 67% reported that briefings were led by the most senior surgical team member, and 58% lasted four minutes or more. Eighteen per cent of respondents felt they were of little benefit, and 56% did not routinely de-brief at the end of the day. This study has highlighted variable attitudes to team briefings, with some colleagues still seeing them as a ?tick box? exercise. While culture has changed following the introduction of the WHO checklist, the importance of active engagement and education to improve the delivery and value of effective briefings cannot be overestimated. It is also an opportunity to create a ?safe space? for team members and to confirm zero tolerance for any inappropriate behaviour, including sexual misconduct.","Introduction
Briefings are an important way of ensuring effective communication, building a team, and adding to the team’s situational awareness (SA). In aviation and other high reliability organisations (HROs) they are compulsory, and a good briefing is paramount to effective threat and error management.1 Aviation is not directly comparable to healthcare and a nuanced approached is needed to take and adapt best practice.2 Resistance to team briefings before any major surgery or interventional procedure can occasionally be influenced by individual surgeon culture rather than by the employing hospital trust.3
In aviation, a checklist is a series of vital actions that must be performed by the flight crew before they are permitted to progress to the next phase of flight - for example, before take-off and landing. A structured verbal briefing, which is particularly important before the flight when team members are unfamiliar with each other, is also employed to cover a wider variety of safety-critical issues. Attitudes and acceptance of essential safety issues before surgical lists have improved since the introduction of the World Health Organization (WHO) surgical checklist.4 However, while the WHO pre-surgery checklist has been adopted worldwide, serious errors (including never events such as wrong site surgery and retained instruments and swabs) still continue to happen.5
An effective team brief should include details of patients on the operating list, with any potential safety concerns or complicating factors highlighted. Ideally it should also include factors relating to human performance, team dynamics, SA, and other issues that could potentially lead to errors.6–9 Briefings, however, can be rushed due to organisational and staff pressures, or individual cultures that may view them essentially as tick-box exercises.6 Aviation procedures are a valuable analogy in this regard, as failure to actively engage can have potentially fatal consequences for both crew and passengers. In our teaching, we promote the concept of owning the briefing and checklist as if one’s own life or limb depended on it, as it does in other HROs.
To our knowledge relatively little has been published on attitudes to briefing as a way to improve the safety of patients and the culture. Most studies have found that briefings improve both patient safety and quality of care.10–12 Effectiveness, however, can be enhanced through team based education on patient safety.13 In the current pilot study we evaluated the perception of surgeons towards operating theatre briefing practice. We were interested in attitudes towards briefings, who usually leads them, how long on average they take, and whether colleagues felt they were interactive.
Methods
Ten questions or statements were devised (Table 1). Eight were used to assess attitudes, one helped to determine the organisational position, and a final one enquired about perceptions of airline flight deck briefings. For some questions (Questions 4–8), a five-point Likert scale was used. The questionnaire was designed to be completed in under two minutes. The questions were uploaded to Survey Monkey, and the survey was accessed by either a QR code or email link.

In total, 26 respondents (24%) answered that they routinely have a debrief at the end of the operating list. Finally, 75 (69%) thought that there would be four or more flightdeck briefings on an Airbus A380 flight from London to Boston.
Discussion
This pilot study has highlighted variable practice in relation to surgical team briefing. While it would be expected that 100% of surgical teams would do some form of briefing before an operating list, we found that only 85% of respondents had at least one briefing per day. No briefings were reported by 16/109 (15%), but given that 16 medical students completed this survey, it is likely that they have not regularly attended or been part of preoperative briefings. It was reassuring that 69% of respondents had a positive experience with team briefings, but disappointingly, only 24% regularly debrief.
There are many potential reasons for this including culture, time constraints, other activities of perceived greater priority, or other factors. Discussion with team members about what went well and what might be improved, as well as thanking the whole team, are good for developing clinical practice and morale.
At a time when the retention of NHS staff is a priority,14 the value of a team debrief cannot be overestimated. It is also a good opportunity to discuss operations and performance with trainees, thereby consolidating learning experiences and, when necessary, ponting out the need for further development. It is also a chance to thank everyone for their input and support.
Following COVID-19, the daily pressures on staff, combined with the increased risk of exhaustion and burnout, as well as mental health issues, are at levels never seen before across the NHS.15–17 Staff are healthcare’s most valuable resource. A good briefing helps to bring teams together, lower stress and hierarchal gradients,18 and enhance patient safety.
Sixty-seven per cent of respondents answered that briefings were led by the most senior team member. It is, however, recommended that trainees are given opportunities to lead briefings on a regular basis.7,8,18 Not only does this help them to develop skills as effective team leaders, but it also reduces either perceived or real hierarchical gradients within the team. Some hierarchy should always be maintained, as there has to be a team leader who is responsible overall for patient care. A flat hierarchy can be more dangerous that a steep one, with the team not knowing who is in charge.19 However, authority gradients should be sufficiently shallow so that if there are patient safety or other concerns, any team member can challenge another without fear.6 The briefing is an ideal opportunity to set the tone for the whole operating list and to create a ‘safe space’ for staff.
A recent study has identified widespread sexual misconduct in surgery.20 While a briefing might not prevent this abhorrent behaviour, it could highlight the fact that it is not acceptable and that there is zero tolerance for it. Even if the team leader is a sexual predator, calling out by others at the briefings that the team has zero tolerance for any such misconduct might make them reconsider their behaviour.
The team briefing is also a great opportunity to build both individual and team SA. Disappointingly, 18% of respondents felt the briefing was a ‘tick-box’ exercise and while 34% listened to it, they had little input or feedback. Only 20% responded that the team brief was dynamic and helped build SA.
Human factors (HF) education is clearly required across healthcare to demonstrate the value of briefing and how, when conducted well, it can both improve input from the whole team and build SA.6,21 The latter needs to be regularly evaluated and updated by teams during surgery, particularly if something does not seem right. This can be achieved by mini-briefings or updates by the operating surgeons. One example is the StOP? protocol.22 At appropriate intervals, the lead surgeon briefly interrupts the procedure to provide a status (St) update, to give details of the next steps/objectives (O) and any potential problems (P), and to encourage team members to ask questions. Another example is the use of a PPP (Patient, Procedure, People) mini-brief which has been developed.23 For both of these updates, the key point is to stop the procedure to update or regain SA for the surgeons and wider team rather than to continue, which can potentially lead to problems.
Question 10 about the number of briefings on an Airbus A380 from London to Boston was included to find out about the perception of other HROs and open a discussion on briefing frequency. On a normal flight without any emergency, 46% of respondents correctly thought that there were normally six briefings on this flight. In any HRO, too many could lead to ‘briefing fatigue.’ However, in healthcare, by recognising their value and that patient safety is paramount, there should not be a maximum number of briefings, and where appropriate it is good practice to consider a ‘mini-briefing’ between complex patients or during a procedure as deemed necessary.
A larger study is now needed to more fully understand the value of, and the attitudes of staff to team briefings in the operating theatre. While there was a 92% response rate by delegates during the ASiT conference HF session, it is not possible to provide the response rate of staff at our NHS trust. Respondents could have positively or negatively biased views on team briefings. Furthermore, the study only included surgical members and not anaesthetists or allied healthcare professionals. However, the study suggests that more HF education is needed across wider surgical specialties to raise awareness of the value of team briefings and how, when conducted effectively, they can empower teams, create a safe space, build SA and, most importantly, enhance patient safety. Colleagues should also recognise that there may be occasions where mini-briefings can be helpful during surgical procedures.
While these might be led by the operating surgeon, as in the StOP? example above,22 any team member should be able to ask the surgeon(s) to stop during the procedure if something does not seem right. Ideally, all team members should be empowered at the main briefing so they feel comfortable and able to challenge more senior colleagues without fear. Visitors to the operating theatre, including medical or dental students should be encouraged to attend briefings so that staff know who they are, and to help them feel valued as part of the surgical team.

Not required.","This research project investigates the impact of team briefings on patient safety and situational awareness (SA) in surgical environments, drawing analogies from aviation where structured briefings and checklists are vital for error management. Recognizing that aviation practices cannot be directly applied to healthcare, the study examines how tailored briefing protocols can improve safety in the operating theatre. A pilot survey was conducted among surgical staff—including consultants, registrars, trainees, and medical students—using a ten-item questionnaire distributed via Survey Monkey at an ASiT conference and within an NHS trust. The survey assessed briefing frequency, duration, leadership, interactivity, structure, and overall attitudes.

Among 109 respondents, 85% participated in at least one daily briefing, while 15% reported no briefings, possibly reflecting limited student involvement. Briefings varied in duration, with a significant portion exceeding six minutes. Most sessions (67%) were led by the senior team member, although only 65% of participants found them interactive and 76% confirmed a consistent structure. Despite 69% reporting a positive experience, just 24% routinely conducted debriefs at the end of operating lists. Barriers identified include time constraints, cultural resistance, and perceptions of briefings as tick-box exercises. The study advocates for increased human factors education and encourages trainee-led briefings to reduce hierarchical barriers and enhance team engagement. Thus, the study emphasizes that adapting aviation-style briefing protocols to healthcare could enhance team performance, clinical safety, and ultimately improve patient outcomes even further.","This pilot study investigates surgeons' perceptions of operating theatre briefings, drawing parallels with aviation's high-reliability organization (HRO) approach.

Results from 109 respondents revealed that while 85% participate in briefings, a concerning 15% reported no briefings. Positive experiences were reported by 69%, but debriefing practices were infrequent (24%).

Osteoarthritis/arthrosis of the mandibular condyle is frequently encountered in the pathology of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in adults (>50 years of age).1,2 The clinical management of TMJ arthrosis, with the exception of some specific nosological situations that require surgery, is usually conservative/symptomatic and based on physiotherapy supported by the use of oral appliances such as bites or night guards, and on the administration of pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory drugs and intra-articular infiltrations.1,3
Joint visco-supplementation is a well-known technique that is widely used to help reduce joint pain secondary to osteoarthritis and osteoarthrosis.2,3 The aim of intra-articular supplementation with hyaluronic acid (HA) is to promote restoration of the physiological viscoelastic condition of the synovial fluid. Intra-articular HA infiltration, which is proven to be effective in relieving painful symptoms and in facilitating the mobilisation of painful joints,4 is recommended in international guidelines for the clinical management of osteoarthritis and osteoarthrosis of various joints.5,6 The procedure is called arthrocentesis, a medical procedure involving the insertion of needles into the joint space under local anaesthesia. It is followed by irrigation with saline solution, concluding with the instillation of sodium hyaluronate, and active joint manipulation.7–9 The biological basis of arthrocentesis revolves around two effects: the mechanical washing away of persistent inflammatory mediators responsible for cell-mediated damage, and the introduction of positive pressure, which may have effects on adhesion lysis and mobilisation of a potentially fixed and blocked disc, often due to a suction-cup mechanism.7,10–12
These actions, in conjunction with the properties of HA, can reduce pain and joint load, and lead to improved function. Consistent scientific literature supports the notion that arthrocentesis provides benefits in pain reduction and joint functionality in 70% - 90% of cases, depending on the onset of symptoms, and recommends its use as the primary treatment in TMJ disorders.13–16
In recent years, not only intra-articular but also pericapsular injection of HA has proved to be effective in reducing pain and improving joint mobility.17,18 This procedure, however, has not yet been tested in the orofacial region.
Polynucleotides (PN), which have the characteristics of a viscoelastic supplement for the joints and perform a trophic action on the joints, are a valid alternative to HA.13–16 Previous clinical research has highlighted the benefits of intra-articular administration of PN and HA for the resolution of arthritic symptoms of the shoulder and knee, amongst other joints, and for improving the functionality of compromised joints.4,15,16,19
The aim of this study was to assess the clinical effectiveness of pericapsular administration of PN in association with HA in the improvement of the signs and symptoms of TMJ arthrosis, compared with clinical management with physiotherapy. The primary objective was to evaluate over time improvements in range of motion (maximum mouth opening) in patients treated with PN injections compared with those treated with physiotherapy. Secondary objectives were to evaluate improvements in lateral excursion of the mandible over time and to estimate the reduction in pain during joint movements over time.
Material and methods
Study design
An interventional prospective single-blinded, randomised clinical trial (RCT) was conducted at the Orthodontics Department of Policlinico Maggiore of Milan (University of Milan “La Statale”, Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda, Milano, Italy) from 1 Dec 2022 to 31 Dec 2023. The study was designed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda (Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy) with protocol number 173901.
The study protocol and results were reported following the CONSORT 2010 checklist for RCTs.20
In the present study, the clinical benefit of pericapsular injection of PN and HA (Poliart®, Mastelli) in TMJ osteoarthrosis was compared with conventional treatment with physiotherapy. Patients suffering from TMJ osteoarthrosis were randomly allocated into two study groups (study group, Poliart® injection; control group, physiotherapy) with a 1:1 ratio.
Participants
Patients suffering from TMJ osteoarthrosis who were referred to the Orthodontics and Gnathology Department of Ospedale Policlinico Maggiore (Milan, Italy) were invited to participate in the study. Recruitment started in December 2022 and ended in January 2023. Participation was voluntary. Each participant was clearly and thoroughly informed about the study methods and implications before enrollment, and written informed consent was recorded for each one.
Patients over 18 years of age with monolateral or bilateral TMJ osteoarthrosis were selected. Those on ongoing therapy with analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory drugs, those with rheumatoid arthritis involving the TMJ, a history of allergies to products of fish origin, TMJ intracapsular condyle-disc derangement, mandibular condylar hyperplasia, or myofascial pain syndrome; together with those with an inability to express consent for participation in the study, those with psychiatric and behavioral disorders, and those with oncological and/or oncohaematological pathologies with compromised general clinical status, were excluded.
Interventions
Patients who agreed to participate in the study underwent a full gnathological examination at baseline (T0) during which mouth opening and lateral movements were measured (in mm). At the same session a visual analogue scale (VAS), a reference that measures subjective pain intensity, was recorded. Similar examinations including VAS measurements were performed at different timepoints (T0: baseline; T1: 2 weeks after T0; T2: 6 weeks after T0; T3: 12 weeks after T0) (Tables 1 and 2).

Study participants were randomly divided into two groups (study group: Poliart® pericapsular injections and control group: physiotherapy). All patients enrolled in the study were asked not to self-administer any anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs. Moreover, patients allocated to the study group were asked not to do any physiotherapy, neither self-delivered nor professionally administered.
Pericapsular injection
Pericapsular injection of 1 ml of Poliart® solution (PN at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and HA sodium salt at a concentration of 10 mg/ml) was administered at the cutaneous tragal point between the condyle and glenoid fossa. This was a pericapsular injection (ai-PN) with dual access, without perforation of the capsule and without anaesthetic, using a standardised technique (Fig. 1). Each patient was injected three times (T0, T1 and T2) according to the Poliart ® leaflet, as advised in the 'dosage' section.

Fig. 1 Injection technique. While the mandible is in an open and protruded position, palpation of the preauricular area is performed to locate the lateral pole of the condyle, and the first injection is administered posteriorly to the condyle at an acute angle (45°). While the mandible is in a closed position, the TMJ is located through palpation and the second injection is administered anteriorly to the TMJ at an acute angle (45°).
Physiotherapy
Patients allocated to the control group were instructed to perform self-delivered physiotherapeutic exercises (mobilisation, muscle-strengthening, and coordination and postural exercises) as described by Shimada et al.21 Mandibular mobilisation exercises consisted of 20 repetitions of lateral excursion on each side and 20 repetitions of mandibular protrusion. Muscle-strengthening exercises comprised isotonic jaw opening and closing, each for one minute. Coordination and postural exercises were performed as follows: in front of a mirror, the patient slowly opens and closes the mandible 20 times keeping their head, neck, and shoulders in a straight position. Patients were instructed to perform the exercises three times daily.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was the increase of unassisted maximum mouth opening. Secondary outcomes were changes in lateral movement of the mandible and VAS score for pain. Mouth opening was measured between the lower and upper incisal edge at the maximum unassisted opening of the mandible (in mm). Overbite (OVB), measured at the maximum intercuspation position, was added to the recorded measurement. Lateral movement of the mandible was measured in mm as the distance between the upper and lower midline at maximum lateral excursion. If the midlines were not centred at the maximum intercuspation position, the midline shift (in mm) was added (if contralateral) or subtracted (if ipsilateral) to the recorded measurement. The VAS score (0: no pain - 10: extreme pain) was recorded according to the pain felt subjectively by the patient.
Sample size
The a priori calculation of sample size was performed in consideration of the variable mouth opening, the primary outcome of the study, using G*Power software (version 3.1.9.6).22 In order to achieve a power of 80%, a type I error probability of 0.05, and considering an effect size of 1.75 for the variables related to the degree of mouth opening,23 the obtained sample size was 54 participants in total, to be allocated into two groups with a 1:1 ratio. To improve the robustness of the data and in consideration of potential non-completers, the sample size was increased by 7%, so 60 patients were recruited into the study and divided into the two arms (30 in each group).
Randomisation
Patients were assigned to the control or study group through simple randomisation. Each was identified by a number, and afterwards a random sequence of numbers was generated by a blinded investigator using an online tool (https://www.randomizer.org/). The allocation ratio was 1:1.
Blinding
Participants assigned to the intervention group were aware of the study arm they were included in; similarly, clinicians administering the injections were aware of the study arm to which the patients were allocated. On the other hand, the examiner performing the gnathological examinations at timepoints T1-T3 was blinded regarding the allocation of the patients.
Statistical methods
Since all the distributions proved to be normal, as resulting from the D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test, the paired Student’s t test was used to compare the consecutive measurements of the parameters evaluated within the groups. The unpaired Student’s t test was used for between-group comparisons. Since the baseline values in the two groups could be different, the comparisons were based on the changes with respect to baseline, calculated at the latest follow up (12 weeks); the relative change from baseline expressed as a percentage was also derived. Probabilities of <0.05 were considered as the threshold for statistical significance. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.01.
Results
In the study group (n = 30) the gender distribution was 18 females and 12 males (mean (SD) age 53 (13) years, range 22–65 years). In the control group (n = 30) the gender distribution was 17 females and 13 males (mean (SD) age 58 (15) years, range 30–63 years).
In the study group four patients did not complete the follow up and were excluded from the analysis. Therefore the results are based on 26 subjects. Table 3 reports the main results. The VAS significantly decreased after two weeks compared with baseline (p = 0.006). Moreover, comparing relative changes from baseline at T2 and T3, the mean values further decreased, remaining significantly lower (by −43.1% and −41.7%, respectively, p = 0.006) (Table 3).

Maximum opening showed a continuous increase from baseline to T3, reflecting a progressive improvement, but the increase with respect to T0 was not statistically significant (p = 0.09 at T3).
Laterality showed a progressive and statistically significant improvement up to T3, both in the right (p = 0.049) and left direction (p = 0.003), though it was more accentuated in the left direction.
Twenty-five patients in the control group completed the follow up. Results are reported in Table 4. No statistically significant difference was found at baseline in all parameters but VAS (p < 0.001). The VAS decreased on average by 15.4% after 12 weeks (Fig. 2). Compared with baseline, the decrease at 12 weeks was statistically significant (p < 0.001), and was significantly less than it was in the test group (p < 0.0001). Maximum opening in the control group increased slightly (by 2.8%) at 12 weeks, the change being not significant compared with baseline (within-group comparison). The between-group difference in change in maximum opening at 12 weeks was not statistically significant (p = 0.42).

Discussion
Periarticular injections are widely used in orthopaedics as they effectively control pain after joint surgery. Generally, the method is used to deliver anaesthetics, analgesics, HA, or a combination of different drugs. Unlike intra-articular injections, the biological risks related to capsular perforation are virtually absent; the administered substances diffuse to the targeted anatomical area without any need to be delivered directly within the joint cavity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the efficacy of pericapsular injection of a combination of PN and HA to relieve symptoms related to TMJ osteoarthritis and osteoarthrosis.
Pericapsular injections of HA have previously been tested successfully in other areas of the body. In fact, Petrella et al experimented with this method for acute ankle sprain and observed a reduction of pain.17 Petrella et al also used periarticular HA in tennis elbow management and noticed both pain relief and a significant improvement in grip strength.18
Similarly, in our investigation a statistically significant reduction in VAS score as a consequence of pericapsular injection was observed. Indeed, a statistically significant improvement was achieved after the first injection, and the subsequent injections consolidated the result. Pain was not significantly different between injections but diverged significantly from T0 (p = 0.006), and a sustained pain-relieving effect was noticeable. In the study by Dallari et al, polynucleotides were tested in the knee joint, and a significant improvement in pain and related function was noted.13
In the present study a clinical improvement in the patients’ joint mobility was recorded. Indeed, unassisted mouth opening showed a gradual increase from T0 to T3, even if statistical significance was not reached, and lateral excursion of the mandible steadily and significantly improved from T0 to T3. The control group also showed an improvement in all the parameters evaluated, but in all cases it was less marked than in the test group, reaching statistical significance for pain relief. In conclusion, after treatment with PN, all clinical parameters demonstrated an improvement in the patients’ condition. No adverse side effects were recorded.
These observations imply that pericapsular PN/HA injection may effectively control and relieve the symptoms of osteoarthrosis and osteoarthritis without invasive manoeuvres and discomfort for the patient. It is interesting to note that the procedure is promising also in improving the mobility of compromised joints. However, due to the lack of statistical significance in mouth opening changes, our results are not conclusive, and further research on a broader sample is recommended.
As opposed to intracapsular injections, pericapsular injections are simple to perform. They seldom require specific training or expertise, and are virtually exempt from anatomical risk and adverse effects. Moreover, unlike intra-articular injection, the pericapsular administration protocol does not need anaesthetic procedures, being almost painless, and is fast and well tolerated by patients, which may be a valuable clinical advantage. The procedure tested in our investigation may therefore become a handy protocol in the gnathologist’s every-day practice. Though it still involves articular injection because, by definition, the joint includes its adjacent structures, the procedure is simplified and there is no need for lavage of the joint.
This study has some limitations. Firstly, the optimal sample size was estimated to be equal to 54 in total (27 patients per group). Even though six additional patients were recruited, four non-completers were recorded in the study group (n = 26) and five in the control group (n = 25), so the study was slightly underpowered. Moreover, a statistically significant difference in VAS scores at baseline was recorded. This could imply either an unforeseen flaw in the randomisation process or the need for a larger sample size. The follow-up duration was only 12 weeks, which is not sufficient to understand if the treatment effect is long-lasting or not. However, it is important to consider that polynucleotides are reabsorbed, and to test over a longer period (one or more semi-annual booster doses may be necessary). The promising results should be confirmed by further studies with wider sample sizes and longer follow up.
Conclusion
PN/HA articular pericapsular injection is a minimally invasive procedure that is effective in the management of osteoarthrosis and osteoarthritis of mandibular condyle. After PN/HA treatment, both pain relief and an improvement in all mandibular excursive movements were noticeable.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda (Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy), protocol No. 173901. Participation was voluntary. Each participant was clearly and thoroughly informed about the study methods and implications before enrollment in the study. Written informed consent was recorded for each participant.","This prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial investigated the clinical efficacy of pericapsular injections combining polynucleotides (PN) and hyaluronic acid (HA) for managing osteoarthritis and osteoarthrosis of the mandibular condyle in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. Conducted at the Orthodontics Department of Policlinico Maggiore in Milan, Italy from December 2022 to December 2023, the study compared a treatment group receiving three pericapsular injections of Poliart® (1 mL of PN/HA at baseline, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks) with a control group undergoing self-administered physiotherapy exercises. Eligible participants were patients over 18 years with unilateral or bilateral TMJ osteoarthrosis, while those with confounding conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, myofascial pain syndrome, or a history of capsular perforation were excluded. Outcome measures included unassisted maximum mouth opening, lateral mandibular excursions, and pain intensity measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) at baseline and at follow-up visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks. In the treatment group, significant reductions in VAS scores and marked improvements in lateral movements were observed compared to the physiotherapy group, although increases in maximum mouth opening did not reach statistical significance. No adverse effects were recorded. These findings suggest that pericapsular PN/HA injections may effectively alleviate pain and enhance joint mobility by reducing inflammatory mediators and facilitating joint movement, all while avoiding the invasiveness of intra-articular procedures. Despite limitations including a modest sample size and a short follow-up period, the results indicate a promising, minimally invasive alternative for TMJ management that warrants further investigation in larger, long-term studies. These results support further clinical exploration.","This study investigates the effectiveness of pericapsular injections of polynucleotides (PN) combined with hyaluronic acid (HA) for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthrosis compared to physiotherapy. Sixty patients with TMJ arthrosis were randomized into two groups: one receiving pericapsular PN/HA injections and the other undergoing physiotherapy.

The study found that the PN/HA injection group experienced a statistically significant reduction in pain (VAS score) and a statistically significant improvement in lateral mandibular movement compared to the physiotherapy group. While mouth opening also improved in the injection group, the change was not statistically significant. No adverse side effects were recorded.

The authors conclude that pericapsular PN/HA injection is a minimally invasive and effective procedure for managing TMJ osteoarthrosis and osteoarthritis, offering pain relief and improved mandibular movement. However, they recommend further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods to confirm these promising results and assess the long-term effects.","This study evaluates the effectiveness of pericapsular injections of polynucleotides (PN) and hyaluronic acid (HA) in managing temporomandibular joint (TMJ) osteoarthrosis, compared to conventional physiotherapy.

The clinical success of dental implant (DI) therapy is directly related to a successful osseointegration process.1 With the improvement of new coating materials and surface treatments, the osseointegration process is highly successful, and it is directly related to the microscopic connection between the DI surface and the host’s bony tissue.1,2 The DI surface features, such as roughness or topography, and the chemical composition can cause different biological responses.3 These characteristics can be influenced by the surface treatment received by the DI and may lead to an increase in the bone-to-implant contact, improving the biocompatibility and osteoinductive or osteoconductive properties, and enhancing the osseointegration.4
After the introduction of the machined DIs, different surface modifications have been developed. These techniques can be additive, such as titanium plasma spray or coating with different elements; they can be subtractive, such as sandblasting or acid-etching; or a combination of two or more of the mentioned techniques may be used.5,6 Sandblasting is one of the most commonly-used surface treatments,3,7,8 although the gold standard is still sandblasting followed by acid etching. During this procedure, small particles of different sizes (25–250 μm) of alumina or titanium oxide are projected onto the DI surface, producing changes on its topography. The roughness created on sandblasted surfaces usually has an arithmetical mean height (Sa) between 1–2 μm.8–10 Surface coating with calcium phosphate (CaP) is one type of bioactive modification technology applied to the surface of the DIs, and this type of thin ceramic layer has been shown to enhance cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation.11
Despite the fact that most studies compare machined surfaces with new rough surfaces or coated surfaces, it is not clear whether one surface modification is better than another. This clinical study aimed to evaluate the long-term (17-year follow up) clinical outcomes of sandblasted DIs with CaP particles and an external hexagon connection (EHC), using a two-stage surgical technique and conventional loading protocol.
Material and methods
This retrospective study was based on 86 patients who received 275 DIs and were consecutively treated with implant-supported prostheses (ISP) between July 2004 to January 2006 in the Faculty of Dentistry of the University of Seville (Spain). The study was conducted according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and is in concordance with the STROBE12 (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for observational studies. All patients signed a doubly-informed written consent for DI placement and had been part of the clinical study. The ethics committee of the University of Seville approved the study. The patient sample was selected using the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:
Inclusion criteria
Included patients were of both genders and aged over 18 years of age, who were fully/partially edentulous, were ASA type I or II, and smoked <10 cigarettes/day, with no need for bone augmentation procedures.
Exclusion criteria
Excluded patients were those with severe systemic diseases (ASA type III or IV), patients with coagulation disorders, alcohol or drug abuse, the use of any medication or health alteration that contraindicates DI treatment, and patients who smoked ≥10 cigarettes/day.
Clinical protocol
Perioperative period
Patients rinsed with 0.20% chlorhexidine digluconate twice daily for 30 days. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 500/125 mg was prescribed one hour before surgery and three times a day (TID), seven days postoperatively. Also, ibuprofen 600 mg/TID, was prescribed for seven days.
Surgical phase
A preliminary study of each case was performed with radiological diagnosis and planning based on orthopantomography, cone-beam computed tomography, diagnostic casts, and clinical photographs. Local anaesthesia was used. A mucoperiosteal flap approach was made, and the DIs were inserted equicrestal following a prosthodontic guided plan. The drilling protocol was the one recommended by the manufacturer (Mozo-Grau™), and the minimum insertion torque was 35 Ncm. All DIs were inserted in a delayed approach (such as Type 4, according to Chen et al).13 No bone or soft tissue grafts were applied.
Second-stage surgery was performed three months after DI placement, and functional loading with ISP was completed approximately three weeks after second-stage surgery.
Follow up
Once the ISP had been installed, patients were checked at three- and six-months during the first year and thereafter once a year during a mean (range) period of 204.80 (192–209) months. The success criteria were established as DI stability and the absence of radiolucency around the DI, mucosal suppuration, or pain. Marginal bone loss (MBL) was determined by a periapical digital radiograph taken perpendicularly to the long axis of the DI. Mesial and distal MBL were calculated as vertical distance between crestal bone level and implant neck.
Dental implant characteristics
Mg-osseous™ screw DIs (MozoGrau™) were used for all patients. The DI surface had been treated with resorbable blast media (RBM), which is a surface treatment designed to increase the roughness surface inducing the sub-micro topography, without leaving the residual embedded blast particles or debris in the treated surface. To develop this process, CaP hardened particles are used for blasting the surface, with a particle size in a range of 90–400 µm and a micro-hardness grains over 350 Hv0.05, and then subsequently dissolved from the surface with a defined passivation method, resulting in a rougher surface compared with traditional acid etching treatments. Greatest arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) was between 1.50 and 2 µm (Fig. 1). The DI was a tissue level commercially pure titanium, grade IV characterised for a universal EHC of 2.7 × 0.7 mm with a platform of 4.1 mm in all DI diameters, a coronally machined surface of 1.5 mm, wide head shape without micro-threads, and ‘V’ shape threads in the body, straight body shape, and domed apex shape (Fig. 2). All DI diameters had a 1.25 mm abutment screw.

Statistical analyses
The statistical analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics 18.0 (SPSS Inc.). Descriptive statistics were performed to describe the results as mean (SD). The chi-squared and two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s PostHoc tests were used for statistical analysis establishing the level of significance with a p value of <0.05.

Biological dental implant complications
During the follow-up period, 32 DIs were associated with peri-implantitis –14 of them being lost – showing statistically significant differences in those patients with a previous history of periodontitis. Only 9.80% of the patients without previous periodontitis developed peri-implantitis (chi-squared test, p = 0.047). This complication was also more common in smoking patients (64.50%). Only 17.20% of non-smokers developed peri-implantitis (chi-squared test, p = 0.036). The cumulative survival rate for all DI was 93.50%.
The mean (SD) MBL was 1.78 (0.40) mm (ranging from 0.90 to 2.80 mm) during the time interval from the DI insertion to the 17-year follow-up evaluation. In patients with a previous history of periodontitis, this MBL was 1.82 (0.47) mm, while in patients without periodontitis was 1.74 (0.44) mm (ANOVA; p > 0.05). Regarding smoking habits, the MBL was 1.84 (0.44) mm for smoking patients and 1.72 (0.46) mm for non-smoking patients (ANOVA; p > 0.05).
Mechanical prosthodontic complications
Twenty-one patients showed some kind of mechanical prosthodontic complications over 52 DIs (Table 4). One overdenture, two partially ISP, and seven unitary ISP had to be renewed.

Discussion
The DI surface characteristics play an essential role in the osseointegration process.2,3 Some experimental in vitro studies have reported that sandblasted surfaces improve the proliferation and osteogenesis differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells.14 A study which assessed different DI surfaces (machined, sandblasted, acid-etched, and sandblasted + acid-etched) demonstrated that the sandblasted DI surface could play an essential role in osseointegration. In this sense, the sandblasted surface demonstrated high biocompatibility and showed that when the human cells reach that rough surface, they tend to exhibit a higher differentiation to osteoblasts than when they approach smoother surfaces.9
A clinical study showed successful results with the same type of DIs used in our study, which were inserted in the anterior area of the edentulous mandible to be restored with overdentures. These authors evaluated primary and secondary stability (three months after placement, at the time of the healing abutment insertion). The DI survival rate was 97.10%. The mean ISQ value for DIs with a diameter of 3.75 and 4.25 mm was 78.40 (5.46) and 80.83 (5.35), respectively (primary stability), and 76.68 (4.34) and 78.22 (6.87), respectively (secondary stability).15 Our clinical findings in this long-term follow-up study (17-year follow up) suggest that sandblasted surface DIs inserted in both maxillary and mandibular areas produce favourable outcomes and stable tissue conditions when a delayed loading protocol is followed. Similar results were reported in several studies.16–19 A prospective study compared an early or delayed DI placement (four and 20 weeks after extraction, respectively) of single sandblasted DIs in the anterior maxilla, observing a cumulative DI survival rate of 100% after 10 years for both protocols.19
When compared to other types of DI coatings, a recent meta-analysis revealed that sandblasted surfaces behave better than machined surfaces in healthy subjects. In this meta-analysis, 16 randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were evaluated, with a total of 722 DIs (362 sandblasted and 360 machined). The results showed that the risk for failure was 74%–80% lower for sandblasted DIs when compared to machined surfaces after 1–6 years.17 On the other hand, a RCT20 examined the clinical and radiographic outcomes of conventionally sandblasted large grit, acid-etched (SLA) DIs versus CaP coated DIs. The study observed that there was a notable increase in overall bone density around both types of DIs. However, it is important to note that these differences were statistically significant, primarily within the CaP coated DI group.
Also, MBL is considered an essential biological and clinical parameter for long-term success. In this regard, another similar RCT observed a mean MBL of 0.11 mm in SLA group and 0.20 mm in the CaP group (p > 0.05) within one-year follow up.11 All of the DIs in both groups survived in both of the RCTs.11,20 The most important biological complication in our study was peri-implantitis (11.60% of DIs) with a mean MBL of 1.78 (0.40) mm after a 17-year follow up. This bone loss was higher than the results described in other studies,11,16,18,21,22 and it might be explained by the fact that many patients included were smokers (32.50%) with a previous history of periodontal disease (17.40%). In this sense, some studies have already confirmed a trend to show a higher MBL in smoker patients treated with sandblasted DIs.18 On the other hand, other similar studies with less MBL used DIs with an internal hexagon connection (IHC) between fixture and abutment.11,18,21,22 A randomised split-mouth controlled trial showed lower MBL for IHC (Morse-taper) in comparison to EHC at 12-month follow up (0.17 mm (0.54), and 1.17 mm (0.44), respectively; p < 0.001).23 Another similar study evaluated the influence of conventional IHC versus EHC on MBL without significant differences between both groups at 36-month follow up (–1.90 mm and –1.70 mm, respectively; p > 0.05).24 These findings are in concordance with previous literature in which internal connections showed lower MBL than external connections.25
Furthermore, prosthodontic complications were frequent in our study – 24.40% of the patients and 19.20% of the DIs, with a prosthodontic survival rate of 90.80%. Technical complications are relatively common in other studies with a long follow-up period.18,19,22 A RCT compared prosthodontic complications between full-arch ISP placed on IHC and EHC DIs, observing a screw loosening rate of 12.50% and 4.65%, respectively (p > 0.05) and an overall prosthodontic survival rate of 95%.24
Limitations and strengths
The present study has some limitations, such as the fact that it is a retrospective study, as well as the lack of collection of certain variables that could have helped to understand the specific characteristics of the population studied, such as the plaque score index, the specific number of cigarettes smoked per day, presence of keratinised tissue and/or soft tissue thickness in the DI site. Undoubtedly, the inclusion of non-smokers and periodontally healthy patients would have helped to reduce the confounding factors of the study, however, these clinical situations are far from the reality of clinical practice in many cases. For this reason, patients included were periodontally controlled and smoked <10 cigarettes/day.
On the other hand, also has some strengths such as the used of sandblasted DIs with only CaP particles rather than conventional SLA, the extended follow up (17 years), the EHC rather than the mainstream internal connection, and the variety of prosthesis types delivered.
Conclusions
Within the limits of the present study, we can conclude that the use of sandblasted (RBM) DIs to support different types of prosthetic restorations results in successful treatment concerning DI and prosthetic survival rates. The MBL was high, which was an expected finding, taking into consideration the high number of smoking patients participating in this study. The use of CaP sandblasted DIs with an EHC using a two-stage surgical technique and conventional loading protocol constitutes a long-term predictable option when strict selection criteria and clinical planning are applied.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission
The ethical committee of the University of Seville approved the study. All patients signed a double informed written consent for DI placement and been part of the clinical study.","This research project evaluated the long-term clinical outcomes of sandblasted dental implants (DIs) with a calcium phosphate (CaP) coating and an external hexagon connection (EHC) over a 17-year follow-up period. The study builds on the principle that successful osseointegration—essential for DI therapy—is strongly influenced by implant surface characteristics. Surface modifications, such as sandblasting, enhance the roughness and topography of the DI surface, which in turn improves bone-to-implant contact, biocompatibility, and osteogenic differentiation. In this context, the CaP coating is employed to further stimulate cellular adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation.

The retrospective study included 86 patients (40 males, 46 females) who received 275 DIs between July 2004 and January 2006. Patients were selected based on criteria such as being over 18 years of age, edentulism status, controlled systemic health (ASA type I or II), and limited smoking habits. The implants were placed using a two-stage surgical protocol with conventional loading. Preoperative and postoperative protocols involved antiseptic rinsing, antibiotic prophylaxis, and anti-inflammatory medication. Radiographic evaluations measured marginal bone loss (MBL), and implant stability was monitored alongside the incidence of peri-implantitis and mechanical complications.

Results demonstrated a cumulative DI survival rate of 93.5%, with an average MBL of 1.78 mm. Peri-implantitis was noted in 11.8% of cases, particularly among patients with a history of periodontitis and those who smoked. Despite some prosthodontic complications, the study concluded that sandblasted CaP-coated DIs with an EHC represent a predictable and effective long-term treatment option when applied under strict clinical criteria and planning.","This study investigates the long-term (17-year) clinical performance of sandblasted dental implants (DIs) with calcium phosphate (CaP) particles and an external hexagon connection (EHC).

Large clinical and population-based epidemiological studies are inherently limited. This multicenter prospective study was conducted between 2017-2021 using the Polish Salivary Network Database (PSND).A dataset of 2653 cases of SGT was analyzed, focusing on submandibular gland (SG) n=173, accessory parotid gland (APG) n=100, and parotid gland (PG) n=2375. Epidemiological and pathological factors were considered to identify malignancy risk and differences between SG, PG and APG tumors.A significant difference was observed in the median age of patients with SG (50.5yrs.) and APG (51.5yrs.) tumours, compared to age of patients with PG tumours (60.0yrs.) at p=3.775e-6. Factor such as tobacco usage (p=8.642e-5) and place of residence (p=0.0158) were associated with these differences. Sex was not a differentiating factor in the risk of malignancy.

Significant differences were found in SG and PG tumour locations between village and city inhabitants (p=0.016).The nature of tumours located in the PG region, comprising the superficial and deep lobe, is distinct in relation to APG tumours. APG tumours exhibit more similarities to tumours originating in the SG region. These findings have the potential to impact future clinical approaches, however, additional validation studies are needed.","Introduction
SGT affect the parotid, submandibular, minor, and sublingual glands in the ratio of 100:10:10:1. The percentage of malignant tumors in these locations is 20%, 50%, 50%, and 80%, respectively.1,2,3 SGT show a different distribution for benign and malignant tumours in major and minor salivary glands, with a predilection and higher risk of malignant disease for certain subsites.4,5,6 There are also different tumour histology characteristics between the large salivary glands: PG and SG. Submandibular triangle neoplasms are rare and pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.7,8 There is a high incidence of malignant neoplasms in this region, reported between 24%7 to 54%, and are characterized by poor differentiation of symptoms that can result in late (often post-operative) diagnosis.9
PG tumors usually have a milder nature, with benign tumours being predominate but reports show that the APG can host more malignant tumors than the rest of the remaining parenchyma. The APG's anatomical and histological structure, featuring mixed acini persisting from early development into later life, may contribute to tumor development in this region.11 A typical APG tumour presents as non-tender slowly growing mid-cheek mass developing over months and exceptionally with rapid increase in size.12 APG tumors are rare, reported to occur in 1%–7.7% of all PG tumors, with reported malignancy rates ranging from 26% to 50% of all accessory parotid neoplasms.13 In a large cohort study, involving 130 patients with tumours in APG region, 53.8% were benign and 23.8% were malignant (22.4% other).30 In a meta-analysis of 3532 records, 187 patients with APG tumors were identified, with 61.5% classified as benign.14
In this study, we explore differences between tumors in the APG and those in regions I-IV of the PG, examining whether their epidemiological and histological traits align more closely with SG than with PG locations. We aim to analyze epidemiological and histological differences among SG, PG, and APG tumours to assess their distinctiveness and similarities. Additionally, we seek to identify epidemiological factors indicating malignancy risks for these tumours, despite their benign clinical features.
Materials and Methods
From 2017-2021, five University Departments collaborated on a multicenter study using the PSND, examining 2653 SGT, including SG, PG and APG locations, to investigate variations in epidemiology, risk factors, and histopathology (HP).
Statistics
Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was performed by executing the command kruskal.test() with R with default options. Logistic regression models were employed to establish relationships between predictor variables and response. Three different combinations of variables for malignant tumour development were used to build up the models, using three groups of selective variables: Group I included all features shown in Tables 1 and 2; Group II included the variables: age at the time of the diagnosis, radiation exposure, tobacco, duration of malignancy symptoms, primary tumour size in cm, presence of recurrent tumour, clinical signs of malignancy, and histology, all with significant p-value; Group III included the variables with <50% of the incomplete data and with p<0.05. 80% of the dataset was use for training and 20% as a testing set. The default threshold (0.5) was used to calculate sensitivity and specificity of each predictor (Fig. 1a). The Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) and Area Under The Curve (AUC) were computed using the R package pROC.15 The clustering heatmap was generated using the R package ComplexHeatmap.16

Results
The study cohort comprised 173 SG, 100 APG, and 2375 PG tumours. The epidemiological and tumour descriptor variables were analyzed and summarized in Tables 1-2.
Age
Age of the studied population showed an average of 56.22 and median of 60.0yrs. Mean age at time of diagnosis for SG, APG, PG was 50.86, 52.09 and 56.75yr. respectively. After categorizing patients by tumor location (SG, APG, PG), there were 84, 46, and 965 patients below the mean age, and 84, 44, and 1359 patients above the mean age, respectively. Statistically significant differences were found (p=3.775e-6).
Gender
No statistically significant differences were found between the sex distribution and tumour location. Histologically, male to female ratio for malignancy versus benign lesions was 15:11 for SG (p=0.003), 11:6 for APG (p=0.042), and 64:64 for PG (p>0.05). Combining sex and malignancy revealed a significantly higher incidence of malignancies in men in SG and APG, but not in PG.
Occupation
Patients were categorized as: white collar workers (including students), manual workers, and retirees. White collar workers comprised n=51, n=35, and n=509 of SG, APG, PG patients respectively; manual workers were n=39, n=20, and n=485 respectively; retirees were n=48, n=32, and n=941 respectively. The only significant difference was found between SG and PG (p=0.017).
Place of residence
Place of residence was categorized as: city 100.000-500.000 inhabitants – n=26, n=19, n=559, city with <100.000 inhabitants n=53, n=28, n=844 and village n=59, n=28, n=603 patients with SG, APG, PG tumours respectively. Differences were found for SG and PG in village inhabitants (37.3% vs 26.02%) and city inhabitants (12.69% vs. 23.38%) (p=0.0158).
Exposure to radiation
Radiation exposure was reported in n=6, n=5, and n=261 patients SG, APG, PG respectively. The percentage of patients exposed to radiation was the lowest for SG and the highest for PG. Significant differences were found between patients with SG and PG for place of residence, radiation exposure and tumour size at presentation. However, due to the small sample sizes and missing data, these results may be over-interpreted.
Exposure to tobacco
Exposure to tobacco (smokers) was reported in n=20, n=11, and n=696 patients SG, APG, PG respectively. The percentage of patients exposed to tabaco was the lowest for SG and the highest for PG and statistically significant (p=8.642e-5).
Tumour size
Tumor sizes were categorized as follows: <2cm, 2-4cm, and >4cm. In the SG region, there were n=66, n=72, and n=19 tumors respectively. In the APG region, there were n=32, n=11, and n=55 tumors respectively. In the PG region, there were n=668, n=340, and n=1303 tumors respectively. The differences between tumour size and location were significant comparing SG and PG (p=0.016).
Histology
Table 2 displays the histological examination results. There were 2282 benign, 261 malignant, and 202 tumors with uncertain histology. Benign tumors included pleomorphic adenoma (PA) n=1082, Warthin's tumor (WT) n=978, and other histological diagnoses n=69. There were n=76 benign and n=21 malignant tumours affecting APG; n=112, n=28 SG, and n=2094, n=212 PG region.
The differences were statistically significant among them (SG, APG, PG) (p=2.2e-16). There were statistically significant differences between APG and PG (p=1.018e-4), also SG and PG (p=7.4e-6). However, there was no difference in proportion of malignant/benign tumours in APG and SG; malignancy percentages were similar for patients with SG and APG, different for PG.
Clinical and radiological symptoms of malignancy
Clinical symptoms typical of malignancy were observed in n=10 SG, n=5 of APG and n=93 of PG patients, more common in SG than in PG. Discrepancies between clinical features and final histology were found in n=3 patients with malignant tumors in SG, n=3 in APG, and n=20 in PG, while in n=4 SG, n=2 APG, and n=15 PG cases, discrepancies occurred between radiology and final histology.
Among 157 tumors, 28 in the SG region were malignant without indicative clinical symptoms; only 2/28 exceeded 4cm and were suspected of malignancy in computed tomography (CT) imaging. One patient had mild clinical symptoms but showed radiological signs of malignancy, resulting in a false negative clinically but true positive in imaging. Three patients showed no clinical no radiological signs, resulting in false negatives.
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB)
FNABs (in total: partial, non-diagnostic, informative) were available for 1384 patients from n=76 SG, n=32 APG, and n=1276 PG region. Full agreement between FNAB and HP was in n=47 SG, n=21 APG, and n=899 PG cases, with concordance rate at 61.84%, 65.62%, and 70.45% respectively. The FNAB/HP correlation was not statistically significant (p>0.5).
Regression analysis
Logistic regression models for malignant tumor development were built using three different variable combinations (Group I, II, III). With McFadden’s R2 values for predictors constructed using Group I (R2=0.277), II (R2=0.579), and III (R2=0.315) variables falling within the acceptable range of 0.2-0.4, we inferred that the variables collected in this cohort can classify tumor locations, despite incomplete information for some individuals. Sensitivity and specificity corresponding to predictors constructed using Group I-III variables were shown in Fig. 1a. The predictor linked to Group II variables showed superior strength compared to the other two predictors (Fig. 1b). Crucially malignant tumors and symptoms persisting for 6-12 months (p=0.002268) are paramount predictors of tumor location in the model built by Group II variables. None of the selected variables were statistically significant individually, but Overall, Group II variables could play a critical role in defining tumor location (Table 3, Fig. 1).

Discussion
SGT are complex and rare lesions in oral pathology practice, limiting population-based epidemiological studies on their histological incidence rates.3 This study presents a unique dataset of 2653 cases of SGT, focusing on APG, PG, and SG tumor analysis. We also define the epidemiological factors that might indicate a risk of histological malignancy for 173 SG and 100 APG tumours, despite the benign clinical features. In our cohort, SG constitute 7,7% and APG 3,7% of total SGT. The obtained results are consistent with literature reports where percentages of APG tumours range from 1%-7,7%.10,13,17
The age, sex and profession of patients with SGT are not widely analysed variables in the literature.18 In our study, it is an important element differentiating the three studied locations. The median age of patients with SG and APG was 51 and was a decade lower than that with PG tumours. Mean age of patients likely dependes on the age distribution in the population; a large analysis of SG malignant tumours in the US showed an average age of 61yrs.,19 51yrs. in a Portuguese cohort,20 while in China it was 45yrs. of age.21
Significant disparities were found between SG and PG patients in residence and radiation exposure, with APG showing intermediate values without significant differences compared to SG or PG. The impact of self-reported radiation exposure and urban pollution on tumor risk remains unclear, with the PG posing the least risk and SG the greatest.
Accurately estimating the incidence of specific histologies is challenging due to geographical and racial variations, alongside nomenclature changes over time.22 Additionally, literature concerning APG is mainly based on case reports 12 or sets of cases.23 While parotid PA and WT are common, diagnosing other benign epithelial tumors is crucial for recurrence risk assessment. HP diagnosis is necessary to differentiate them from malignant salivary gland tumors and prevent confusion. 22 50%–57% of SG are benign, most frequently pleomorphic adenoma, and 43–50% are malignant, with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) being the leading neoplasm.24
Tumors in region V exhibit complex pathology due to the cellular diversity in the salivary gland and distinct differentiation of the APG parenchyma from the rest of the gland.11 It's important to compare tumors in region V with those in regions I-IV of the salivary gland parenchyma. In our data set, the percentage of malignancies was similar for patients with SG (21%) and APG (16%) locations, but significantly different for PG (5.2%). Also, the proportion of the benign tumours (PA: WT) were similar for SG and APG locations with strong PA predominance, whereas the proportion was significantly different for PG. In I-IV parotid regions, PA/WT frequency distribution was comparable.
The distribution of HP results is striking, with typical salivary gland malignancy predominating, but MALTs are also present. Large tumor sizes, high malignancy rates, and younger patient ages in this subgroup suggest high-risk factors, necessitating increased oncological vigilance. This indicates that APG tumors share similarities with the more malignant nature of SG tumors, setting them apart from the rest of the parotid parenchyma.
Accurate diagnosis of neoplastic processes requires analyzing discrepancies between clinical features, imaging, and final histology.26 Malignant signs were observed in tumors >4cm or with facial nerve paresis. Advanced imaging detected malignancy in 19% of patients with a benign clinical presentation but remained false negative (both clinically and radiologically) in 38% of cases.
FNA has become a commonly performed and clinically useful diagnostic tool in the initial evaluation of masses of the major salivary gland and since 2018 27 is evaluated according to the Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology. The system provides the concepts of the margin of risk of malignancy for the categories of suspected malignancy and SGT of uncertain malignancy potential.28 Although it facilitates clearer communication between cytologists and clinicians and improves communication between institutions, discrepancies still exist in the final diagnosis.29 The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in detecting malignancies has been estimated at 79%, 100% and 88%, respectively.24 some studies showed lower accuracy of FNA in diagnosing ACC. Both, cytologists and clinicians should be aware of the possibility of overlooking small ACC foci or misdiagnosing ACC as PA.29
In summary, this study analyzed epidemiological and tumor-related features, revealing differences among tumors of the major salivary glands. Our findings demonstrate distinct characteristics between tumors in the PG regions and those in the APG, which closely resemble tumors originating in the SG. These insights can enhance early detection, and inform public health strategies to reduce tumour incidence through lifestyle modifications.

SGTs affect the major and minor salivary glands in varying ratios, with malignancy percentages differing considerably among these sites. Notably, while PG tumors are predominantly benign, APG tumors—although rare, accounting for 1%–7.7% of all parotid tumors—often display a higher risk of malignancy (26%–50%) and share features with SG tumors, which are known for a higher malignant rate.

The multicenter study, conducted from 2017 to 2021 across five university departments using the PSND database, evaluated 2653 SGT cases. Detailed patient demographics, lifestyle factors (including tobacco and radiation exposure), and tumor characteristics (such as size and symptom duration) were recorded. Statistical analyses, including the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and logistic regression models with three variable groupings, were used to identify predictors of malignant transformation and to classify tumor locations. Results indicated significant differences in age at diagnosis, exposure to risk factors, and tumor size among SG, APG, and PG groups. Additionally, while fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) showed moderate concordance with histopathology, discrepancies persisted, especially in detecting malignancy in APG tumors.

Overall, the study underscores the importance of considering epidemiological factors and histological differences when diagnosing SGT. Its findings suggest that APG tumors, which clinically may appear benign, require increased oncological vigilance—insights that could enhance early detection and inform public health strategies aimed at reducing tumor incidence.","This study investigates salivary gland tumors (SGTs) in different locations: submandibular (SG), accessory parotid (APG), and parotid gland (PG) to identify epidemiological and histological distinctions. Data from 2653 SGT cases collected from 2017-2021 were analyzed. Tumors in the APG exhibit characteristics that differ from PG tumors and align more closely with SG tumors. SG and APG tumors tend to occur in younger patients. There were also significant differences found between SG and PG patients in residence and radiation exposure, with APG showing intermediate values. Malignancy percentages are similar in SG and APG but lower in PG. The study's logistic regression models found that a tumor size of 6-12 months was the strongest predictor of tumor location. Also that the most significant classifier variables were Place of residence and clinical features. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of recognizing APG tumors as a distinct subgroup with closer affinities to the more malignant SG tumors.","This study investigates the epidemiological and histological differences between salivary gland tumors (SGT) in the submandibular gland (SG), accessory parotid gland (APG), and parotid gland (PG) regions.

Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is an auto-inflammatory bone disease that presents with recurrent localised pain, swelling, and characteristic radiological features. Often a systemic disease, it uncommonly presents in the craniofacial skeleton alone. Due to its relative rarity, with a presumed incidence of 4/1 million people,1 and its non-specific features, a diagnosis is difficult to make. This is further compounded by its non-specific clinical features (swelling, pain, erythema) and radiological appearances, which are often confused with infection, neoplasm, or fibrous dysplasia.2 Craniofacial CNO therefore is often a diagnosis of exclusion, and due to its rarity, there is often a delay in its diagnosis.
The exact aetiology of CNO is unknown and various theories have been proposed. It is likely that increased interleukin 1β (IL-1β) leads to aberrant osteoclast activation,3 which forms the rationale for targeting IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in its management. Whilst animal models have suggested a genetic cause with loss of function mutations, how this relates to human cases is not clear.4 It may also be that changes in the gut microbiome may alter immune homeostasis and trigger the auto-inflammatory cascade.5
Various treatment options for craniofacial CNO have been suggested, ranging from no treatment, antibiotics, steroids, bisphosphonates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), and surgical debridement, to segmental resection.6–8 A recent systematic review by van de Meent et al reviewed these, and suggested that non-invasive conservative treatments, including anti-resorptive drugs, should be considered the first choice.9 Further work since then by Schnabel et al demonstrated the efficacy of both pamidronate and anti-TNF therapies, with little difference between the two.4 As a result of this clinical equipoise, correct management of these patients is under debate. Since their care is primarily medical and they often require systemic evaluation and treatment, combined rheumatological and surgical care is needed.
As a tertiary paediatric oral and maxillofacial unit, our team sees a large number of these referrals and has the opportunity to work closely with a specialist rheumatologist. This paper aims to outline the experiences of our unit, to develop diagnostic criteria, and provide a management algorithm for craniofacial CNO.
Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with CNO affecting the mandible between 2018 and 2022, who were referred to a tertiary paediatric oral and maxillofacial unit (Great Ormond Street).
We retrospectively reviewed the referring letters, clinical notes, imaging, histopathology, microbiology, haematological investigations, operative findings, management, and clinical outcomes of all patients diagnosed with craniofacial CNO during this four-year period.
All data have been anonymised. The project was registered and approved by the Great Ormond Street Hospital research department. Ethics approval was deemed unnecessary given that the study was retrospective and all data were pre-existing and available from existing anonymised medical records.
Results
Our retrospective analysis highlighted 10 patients with a new diagnosis of craniofacial CNO between 2018 and 2022. They presented to the oral and maxillofacial department as new referrals from units in the south of England, and were managed by the oral and maxillofacial team in conjunction with rheumatology and infectious diseases.
Epidemiology
The mean (range) age of the patients at diagnosis was 9.8 (8-13) years. The female: male ratio was 4:1. 9, and the 10 patients were white Caucasian.
Clinical features
All patients presented with the site of primary disease at the posterior mandible. Nine of the 10 cases were unilateral with seven left-sided. All 10 patients reported pain, although this was often with intermittent flare-ups and painless periods varying between weeks and months. They all had a degree of reduced mouth opening. Seven had no other medical issues. Of the three with existing medical issues, only one had a possible autoimmune condition (thymic mass).
Laboratory investigations
All 10 patients in this series had normal white cell counts, and normal or low C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Two of the 10 had raised erythrocyte sedimentation rates, but these were only mildly elevated at a maximum of 20 mm/hour. All other routine laboratory investigations (including haemoglobin, electrolytes, and renal function) were normal in all cases.
Radiology
The radiological findings of CNO are distinctive, and often homogeneous. All patients underwent CT imaging, the majority of which were completed at the referring unit. The common descriptive features of all 10 cases were “sclerosis, periosteal reaction”, with six of the 10 reports including the terms “ground glass with soft tissue oedema”. Axial slices of four different patients have been included in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 Radiographic features.
Histopathology
Histopathological findings featured common findings in eight of the nine patients who underwent biopsies (one patient did not have a biopsy). Non-specific chronic inflammation and/or sclerotic and reactive bone was evident in eight. A biopsy in one patient was reported as normal bone with no significant inflammation.
Microbiology
Nine of the 10 microbiology samples demonstrated no growth on microscopy, cultures, and sensitivities. One sample demonstrated Staphylococcus epidermidis, but this was reviewed and discussed with the microbiology team and believed to be a false positive with skin contaminant.
Extra-cranial manifestations
Only two of the 10 patients demonstrated any extra-cranial manifestations of CNO. Of them, one (male) presented with asymptomatic lesions in the clavicle, whilst one (female) patient developed symptomatic lesions in the trochanter, sacroiliac joints, and tibias.
Management and outcomes
All these paediatric patients with a diagnosis of CNO were referred to paediatric rheumatology services for assessment and management. As part of this assessment, they underwent full body MRI to assess for any extra-cranial disease. Only three of the 10 patients required IV pamidronate, with the other seven improving on naproxen. Of the three who required pamidronate, only one required more than one infusion. In our follow-up period (between 2 and 49 months) we report no recurrences following treatment.
Discussion
Our case series demonstrates a homogeneous presentation which should alert clinicians to the possible diagnosis of CNO. Typically, patients present between the ages of 8 and 13 years with a painful posterior mandibular swelling with normal white cell counts and CRP, and usually normal or low ESR levels. CT imaging typically demonstrates sclerosis, with oedema and periosteal reaction with appearances very similar to osteomyelitis or fibrous dysplasia.
In some ways our patient cohort is typical of that reported in the literature: mostly Caucasian female and around 10 years old.10,11 However, there were some notable differences. The vast majority of our patients did not present with other autoimmune conditions and only 20% had any extra-cranial manifestations. Other case series of CNO suggest that patients will often have concurrent autoimmune or atopic disease, and that the disease is often multifocal.12
This has a significant implication for diagnosis. The two main diagnostic criteria of CNO are the Jansson or Bristol criteria,13 which were primarily developed from patients with multi-focal lesions, in particular in the long bones. These criteria place emphasis on multi-focality, skin lesions, and a positive family history of autoimmune disease, and do not place an emphasis on bone biopsy, which our unit and other authors have advocated as having an important role in diagnostic accuracy.10,14
We argue that these populations who present with multifocal CNO are distinct from those who present primarily with craniofacial CNO (only 20% of whom in our cohort had any extra-cranial features). We have therefore developed specific diagnostic criteria for craniofacial CNO, highlighting the common features seen in all our patients (Table 1).

It is not clear why all cases presented in the same location (angle and ramus of the mandible). Whether this was due to particular attributes of the bone type or blood supply is conjecture and has yet to be determined. In addition, 90% of our patients were white Caucasian. This may represent an increased ethnic risk. Conversely, it may represent the demographics of our patient population. This does still seem to be inflated, especially given that our unit is a tertiary referral centre, based in a large, multicultural city.
Encouragingly, most patients (70%) had resolution of their symptoms with naproxen. Of those who did not, only one required more than one infusion of pamidronate for disease remission. One of the nine underwent surgical recontouring of the mandible, but this was as a secondary procedure and aimed to improve symmetry and cosmesis rather than disease remission.
There is clinical equipoise in the management of CNO, with some advocating conservative management only, and others suggesting anti-inflammatories or anti-resorptive mediation.9,10 Given the rarity of the disease, large randomised controlled trials are not possible. Some reports suggest extensive surgical debridement as the treatment of choice,7 but our experience has demonstrated that this is not necessary for primary management.
To our knowledge, our study is the largest case series of craniofacial CNO in the European literature. A recent case series from Seattle demonstrated similar findings, namely similar proportions of patients presenting with extra-cranial disease.10 However, their protocol involved intraoral biopsy, and they reported approximately a 16% contaminant rate compared with our 10% contaminant rate with an extraoral approach. Whilst their protocol involved NSAIDs as first line treatment, they reported a full response rate of only 11%, in comparison to our response rate of 70%. It may be that differences in the choice of NSAIDs, dosing, or definitions of complete response rate may account for this.
Recommendations
1.        
Biopsy and microbiological investigations should be performed extraorally
To avoid false positives of oral contaminants in microbiological specimens, we recommend that the biopsy and bone specimens for microbiology should be obtained via an extraoral approach. Even with this there is a risk of a false-positive contaminant. We recommend that two bone samples are taken for histopathology and microbiology, and we advise that these samples should undergo PCR for microbiology due to increased sensitivity. The histology may show chronic inflammation, and/or reactive bone, but not always. In patients who fail to respond to bisphosphonates we recommend considering re-biopsy to reassure our diagnosis.
2.        
Medical management as standard - we recommend a three-month trial of naproxen, and in patients who fail to improve, consideration of further IV pamidronate infusions.
Our experience suggests that it is advisable to commence naproxen once a diagnosis of CNO is suspected. According to our experience, 70% of patients can be successfully managed with naproxen alone. Following a three-month review, if not improved, we would then consider the addition of IV pamidronate. This is given at a dose of 1 mg/kg to a maximum of 30 mg for three consecutive days and repeated three-monthly as required. Pamidronate, which can be associated with flu-like symptoms, headache, and fever, is continued until resolution of pain. In those who fail to respond to bisphosphonates, we recommend re-biopsy and revisiting the original diagnosis. MRI is considered at 12 months to assess disease activity objectively. This management protocol is in concordance with guidance based on the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) consensus paper.13
3.        
Assess for extra-cranial disease
A thorough history, including comorbidities and family history will assist in diagnosis. In particular it is important to ask about inflammatory bowel disaease (IBD), spondyloarthropathy, and associated skin conditions such as psoriasis vulgaris, and severe acne. These, combined with a multifocal presentation, and a male gender, are associated with a severe phenotype. A milder phenotype is associated with females with unifocal lesions (the majority of our cohort).15,16
All patients should undergo a full body MRI to assess for extra-cranial bony disease. A whole-body MRI is key to detecting subclinical lesions and can be useful to monitor disease progression and remission. Typically, these will show bone marrow involvement with decreased signal intensity on T1 and foci of increased intensity on T2.
Limitations
The limitation of our study is that being a children’s hospital, we have an inherent selection bias in only seeing children who present with CNO. CNO can occur in adults but is reported to be less common and is often associated with autoimmune conditions such as Crohn’s disease.11 Furthermore, as an OMFS department we see only those patients who present with craniofacial lesions primarily. Therefore, there may be a cohort of patients who present with extracranial lesions first, and then craniofacial lesions second, who we may not have identified. Finally, we appreciate that our follow-up period is variable and limited to a mean of less than two years, so we cannot comment reliably on long-term relapse.
Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest case series of paediatric craniofacial CNO in the European literature. We have described our novel diagnostic criteria for craniofacial CNO and have outlined our recommendations for work-up, investigation, and management of these patients. A key tenet in their care is the importance of joined up work between rheumatologists and maxillofacial surgeons.

Focusing on mandibular involvement, the study is a retrospective analysis conducted at a tertiary pediatric oral and maxillofacial unit between 2018 and 2022, involving 10 patients with a mean age of 9.8 years, predominantly female and white Caucasian. All patients presented with unilateral posterior mandibular lesions, intermittent pain, and reduced mouth opening. Laboratory findings were largely unremarkable, with normal white cell counts, low C-reactive protein, and only mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates in a few cases.

Radiological evaluations, primarily via CT imaging, consistently demonstrated features such as bone sclerosis, periosteal reaction, and in some cases “ground glass” appearances with soft tissue edema, which can mimic infection, neoplasm, or fibrous dysplasia. Histopathology in most cases revealed chronic inflammation and reactive bone changes, while microbiology was negative for infection in the majority, confirming a non-bacterial etiology.

Given the diagnostic challenges, the authors developed specific diagnostic criteria for craniofacial CNO, incorporating clinical presentation, laboratory results, imaging, microbiology, and histopathology. Management recommendations include a three‐month trial of naproxen, which successfully resolved symptoms in 70% of cases, with intravenous pamidronate reserved for non-responders. The study underscores the need for coordinated care between rheumatologists and maxillofacial surgeons and represents the largest European case series on pediatric craniofacial CNO, contributing valuable insights into its diagnosis and management.","This retrospective study analyzes 10 cases of craniofacial chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) affecting the mandible in pediatric patients referred to a tertiary unit between 2018 and 2022.

Dentofacial deformities (DFDs) are considered changes in facial proportions and malocclusions that can influence an individual’s quality of life (QoL)1 and negatively interfere with aesthetics, occlusal function, and biopsychosocial behaviour.2 The ideal treatment is orthosurgical.3 Studies have shown that orthognathic surgery has a positive impact on oral health-related QoL in individuals with a class II facial profile.4
The orthognathic quality of life questionnaire (OQLQ), a instrument developed in 2000,5,6 can quantify and measure the QoL of individuals undergoing orthosurgical treatment. It was translated and validated for use in the Portuguese language in 2011.7
Several factors can influence the perception of QoL in patients with DFDs, for example, clinical factors (including the type of official profile),8,9 and polymorphism in specific genes,10 which can interfere with this perception. In patients undergoing orthognathic surgery, polymorphisms in the ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1) genes have been linked to positive impacts on QoL.8
Our group has also discovered an association between the FKBP prolyl isomerase 5 (FKBP5) gene and surgical discomfort in third molar extraction.11 Consequently, we propose that this gene could potentially have an influence on the perception of QoL in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery. This is because FKBP5 is directly linked to post-traumatic disorders,12 depressive disorders,13and anxiety.14
The perception of QoL in patients with DFDs has been examined in previous studies. However, to our knowledge, the literature is limited when it comes to evaluating the perception of QoL using the OQLQ. We know of no assessment to date regarding the role of the FKBP5 gene in QoL perception among individuals with DFDs. This study therefore aimed to compare various factors concerning the perception of QoL in patients scheduled for orthognathic surgery. We hypothesised that sex and polymorphisms in the FKBP5 gene are related to perception of QoL.
Material and methods
Ethical considerations
The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Positivo (UP) in co-participation with the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR) under the number 80846317.8.0000.0093, and it adheres to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided their consent by signing the informed consent form. This observational cross-sectional study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the Strengthening the Reporting of Genetic Association Studies (STREGA) statement (Supplementary file).
Study design and participants
Individuals with DFDs aged 18 and above, of either sex, who were scheduled for orthognathic surgery between July 2019 and January 2021, were included in the study. They were all in the final stage of pre-surgical orthodontic treatment. Syndromic patients, individuals who had previously undergone orthognathic surgery, patients with cleft lip and palate, and those with a history of facial trauma, were excluded.
Details of age, facial profile, and facial asymmetry were gathered. Trained senior surgeons categorised the facial profiles into classes I, II, and III, following the classification by Capelozza.15 Facial asymmetry was considered as a deviation of more than 4 mm from the mandibular midline.16
Quality of life (QoL) assessment
The OQLQ quantifies the perception of QoL in individuals undergoing the final phase of pre-surgical orthodontic treatment. Participants are asked to respond to 22 statements using a four-point scale. A score of one indicates that the issue addressed in the statement causes minor discomfort, while a score of four indicates significant discomfort. Scores of two and three represent intermediate levels of discomfort. A “not applicable” option is available for issues that do not affect the participant (Supplementary file). The total score can range from 0 to 88 points, with a higher score indicating that the DFD has a more substantial negative impact on the patient’s oral health-related QoL.
The 22 statements are categorised into four domains: perception of facial aesthetics, oral function, deformity awareness, and aspects of deformity.
Collection of genetic material
Epithelial cells from the oral mucosa were used to collect DNA. After rinsing the mouth for two minutes with a 3% glucose solution, the buccal mucosa was scraped gently with a sterilised wooden spatula purified with10 mM ammonium acetate and 1mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Polymorphisms linked to the FKBP5 gene (rs3800373 and rs1360780) were then assessed (Table 1).

The patients underwent genotyping for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) tag using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The process was conducted using the 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan TM technology (Applied Biosystems).
Statistical analysis
The research data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 21.0 (IBM Corp), with a significance level set at 5%. Age was dichotomised based on the median and the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were employed for group comparison. The chi-squared test was used to compute the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The power of the sample was calculated using OpenEpi version 3 (www.openepi.com) considering the standard deviation of the OQLQ.
Results
This study included 91 patients with DFDs. However, only 71 participants were considered because of DNA errors during PCR. The sex distribution was approximately 2:1, with 60 female and 31 male participants (median (range) age 28 (18-64) years). The sample power was 100%.
When the age variable was dichotomised into ≤28 and >28 years and compared with the OQLQ using the Mann-Whitney U test, no statistical differences were observed in the overall OQLQ score or its domains. However, a significant difference was noted when the OQLQ was analysed in relation to sex (Fig. 1). Among the general OQLQ scores, female patients exhibited a higher median (range) score for perceived QoL (42.4 (3–87)) than males (27 (3–76)) (p = 0.019). In specific domains of the OQLQ, statistically significant differences were observed for “oral function” (p = 0.032) and “awareness of the deformity” (p = 0.009). In all domains where significance was found, scores were higher in the female group than in the male group (Table 2). This suggests a more negative impact on QoL in females.

The genotypic frequencies of the FKBP5 gene polymorphisms adhered to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. For the rs3800373 genetic polymorphism, no statistically significant difference was observed in both the general OQLQ and its domains (Table 4). Regarding the rs1360780 genetic polymorphism within the dominant model and the “facial aesthetics” domain, individuals carrying the C allele perceived their QoL to be lower than individuals with the TT genotype (p = 0.037) (Table 5).

Discussion
Several factors potentially related to the perception of QoL in individuals with DFDs who were listed for orthognathic surgery. QoL is a broad concept, and more specific instruments tailored to the health conditions presented by individuals are currently needed. Established instruments in the literature, such as the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) – 49 and OHIP-14 are generic and provide only a summary of the patient's overall health.6 The use of specific instruments like the OQLQ, which focuses on a particular change or a distinct patient group, may therefore offer more feasible and accurate assessment of QoL related to a DFD.
Many studies have failed to determine the perception of QoL in patients with DFDs between the preoperative and postoperative periods.17,18 In contrast, our study sought to explore various factors, including genetic ones, that are potentially related to the perception of QoL in patients before they undergo orthognathic surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the potential influence of genetic polymorphisms in the FKBP5 gene on the OQLQ.
Age did not appear to be related to the perception of QoL in individuals with DFDs, even after orthognathic surgery.19 However, Bortoluzzi et al, utilising the OQLQ, discovered that the age of patients with DFDs had a distinct impact on perception of QoL.1 Using the World Health Organization QoL – BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), Gabardo et al also identified a relation between perception of QoL and age. They observed that younger individuals (<30 years) did not exhibit significant improvement in the physical domain of the questionnaire after surgery, unlike their older counterparts.8 In contrast, we found no relation between these variables. This could be attributed to the median age of the patients seeking orthosurgical correction for DFDs in our service.
The literature generally agrees that DFDs in females have a more negative impact on QoL than they do in males. Stagles et al used the OQLQ to evaluate the QoL perception of individuals referred for orthognathic surgery, and found that the impact was more negative in females.20 Similarly, Sun et al found that individuals reported lower scores in the OQLQ domains postoperatively, indicating that orthognathic surgery had a positive impact on QoL perception.20 Our study, which corroborates these findings and shows that QoL perception is more negatively affected in females, is consistent with the findings of Mendes de Paula Gomes et al.21 They concluded that media-influence and the pursuit of beauty standards can distort a patient’s image of self, intensify feelings of inadequacy, and have a negative impact on their QoL perception.22
On comparing facial profiles with the data derived from the OQLQ responses, we found no relation with QoL perception. This finding aligns with that of Gabardo et al, who also found no relation between facial profile and its influence on the QoL of patients with DFDs.8 In another study, Jovic et al compared facial profiles I, II, and III, and found that patients deemed profile III less aesthetically pleasing, while females considered profiles I and II more aesthetically pleasing.9
Liu et al conducted a study to evaluate the impact of oral health and perception of QoL in individuals undergoing orthodontic treatment for facial asymmetry.23 They found no significant impact on QoL when compared with a group without asymmetry.23 Gabardo et al also conducted a study to assess the impact of facial asymmetry on QoL and found no association between these factors,8 a finding that aligns with the results of the present study.
Recent observations in patients with DFDs suggest that a patient’s genetic component can influence their perception of QoL. Sprangers et al highlighted the complexity of genetic variables in relation to QoL perception.10 Our group has previously identified a connection between the ANKK1 gene and QoL perception, with this gene also being associated with depression and anxiety.8 Another study found that IL-6 is involved in domains related to psychological discomfort, social incapacity, and a deficient QoL.24
The FKBP5 gene has attracted the attention of numerous research groups due to its association with depressive disorders, suicide, and heightened surgical discomfort.11,25 Our team has previously identified its association with an intensified perception of surgical procedures, specifically the extracting of third molars.11 Consequently, we assessed its potential influence on the perception of QoL in patients scheduled for orthognathic surgery.
Our study revealed a direct relation between the rs1360780 polymorphism in the C allele (CC/CT) and a negative impact on perception of QoL in the “facial aesthetics” domain of the OQLQ. In a separate study by Fan et al, a direct relation was identified between the codominant model (CC/CT) and an elevated risk of depression.26 This particular marker has also been linked to the development of suicidal behaviour.13
The study also evaluated another polymorphism (rs3800373), which is associated with an individual’s risk of developing depressive disorders and is linked to completed suicide.13 Fan et al discovered that this same polymorphism is involved in an increased risk of depression in the codominant model (AA/AC).26 However, when we related these polymorphisms to the results of the OQLQ administered before orthognathic surgery, we found no statistically significant difference.
Regarding the limitations of the study, it was an observational study conducted in a specific region of Brazil, and thus our findings are representative only of that particular population. In terms of the ethnic composition of our sample, it is recognised that Curitiba, a city in southern Brazil, has a predominantly European ancestry (95.5%), with African (2.3%) and Amerindian (2.2%) ancestries also present. It is crucial to acknowledge that perceptions of QoL can vary significantly across different global contexts.
Additionally, the study did not evaluate aspects related to the presence of chronic pain, temporomandibular disorders, and facial dysmorphia. With respect to the FKBP5 gene, only two polymorphisms were examined, so it is not possible to determine conclusively the role of the entire gene in the perception of QoL in patients with DFDs. It is important to highlight the fact that we assessed only a portion of this gene. Further studies are required to elucidate the relation between the entire FKBP5 gene, and it is important to evaluate other genes that could be associated with the perception of QoL.
It is crucial to note the timing of the instrument’s application to the participants, which occurred during the final stage of orthodontic preparation, near to the surgical procedure. This timing could potentially have heightened some patients’ anxiety levels, thereby influencing the analysed factors.
Utilising the OQLQ to evaluate the perception of QoL and its relation with the factors identified in this study enables a more tailored approach for each individual, taking into account both genetic and social aspects to gauge the impact of a DFD. This understanding could facilitate the provision of early therapeutic or preventive options for those affected.
Conclusion
Observations revealed that DFDs had a greater negative impact on QoL in females during the preoperative stage of orthognathic surgery. Additionally, presence of the C allele (CC/CT) for the rs1360780 marker of the FKBP5 gene was found to have a negative influence on the perception of QoL in patients scheduled for orthognathic surgery.

The Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Positivo (UP) were in co-participation with the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR) under CAAE 80846317.8.0000.0093, and followed the Helsinki Declaration. All participants agreed and signed an informed consent form.","This research project evaluated quality of life (QoL) in patients with dentofacial deformities (DFDs) scheduled for orthognathic surgery, and investigated how both clinical and genetic factors influence patient perceptions. DFDs—characterised by altered facial proportions, malocclusions, and impaired occlusal function—can significantly disrupt aesthetics and biopsychosocial well‐being. The study employed the Orthognathic Quality of Life Questionnaire (OQLQ), an instrument specifically developed to quantify the impact of DFDs on patients’ QoL, and previously validated in Portuguese.

A total of 91 patients in the final stage of pre-surgical orthodontic treatment were recruited, although only 71 were included in the genetic analysis due to DNA quality issues. Clinical variables assessed included age, facial profile (classified into types I, II, and III), and facial asymmetry. Statistical analysis revealed that neither age nor the evaluated clinical parameters significantly influenced the overall OQLQ scores. However, female patients exhibited significantly higher OQLQ scores compared to males, indicating a more negative perception of QoL among women.

Additionally, the study examined two polymorphisms in the FKBP5 gene (rs1360780 and rs3800373) due to the gene’s known associations with depressive and anxiety disorders. It was found that carriers of the C allele (CC/CT) for rs1360780 reported poorer perceptions of facial aesthetics, whereas no significant QoL differences were associated with rs3800373. Overall, the findings suggest that gender and specific genetic variants may modulate QoL perceptions in DFD patients, underscoring the potential for tailored therapeutic approaches in orthognathic treatment.","This study investigates factors influencing the quality of life (QoL) perception in patients with dentofacial deformities (DFDs) before orthognathic surgery, using the Orthognathic Quality of Life Questionnaire (OQLQ). The research aims to determine if sex and polymorphisms in the FKBP5 gene are related to QoL perception.

The study involved 91 DFD patients undergoing pre-surgical orthodontic treatment, excluding syndromic patients or those with prior facial trauma. Data on age, facial profile, asymmetry, and QoL were collected. Genetic material was analyzed for FKBP5 gene polymorphisms (rs3800373 and rs1360780).

Results indicated that females reported a significantly lower QoL than males, particularly concerning oral function and awareness of the deformity. No correlation was found between age, facial profile, asymmetry and QoL. However, the presence of the C allele for the rs1360780 polymorphism was associated with a negative impact on the perception of facial aesthetics.

The study highlights the importance of considering genetic and social factors in understanding QoL perceptions in DFD patients, potentially allowing for personalized therapeutic approaches. It acknowledges limitations including regional specificity, ethnic composition of the sample, lack of evaluation for chronic pain, and timing of data collection before surgery, which might influence anxiety levels.","This research paper investigates the impact of dentofacial deformities (DFDs) on quality of life (QoL) and explores factors influencing QoL perception in patients scheduled for orthognathic surgery. DFDs, which affect facial aesthetics and function, often negatively impact QoL.

In order to achieve rapid diagnosis, clinicians need to be aware of the risk factors associated with concomitant TBI and facial fractures. Previous literature suggests that a facial fracture can be considered a significant indicator of TBI. Nevertheless, a large data gap remains on specific injury patterns of facial fractures and associated TBI. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate and compare the frequency of and risk factors for TBI in patients with and without different types of additional injuries. The retrospective cohort study included 1836 facial fracture patients aged at least 18 years. The outcome variable was TBI with radiological findings in computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The primary predictor variables were associated injury outside the head and neck, associated cranial fracture and associated neck injury. Based on this study, associated cranial fracture increased the risk of TBI 4.7-fold. Patients with associated neck injury had a 2.1-fold risk of TBI. In addition, significant predictors for TBI were increasing age (p¬†=¬†0.0004), high energy of injury (p¬†<¬†0.0001) and anticoagulant medication (p¬†=¬†0.0003). Facial fracture patients with associated injuries in the head and neck region are at significant risk of TBI. In clinical work, multiprofessional evaluation of facial fracture patients should be routine and repeated survey should be targeted especially at high-risk patients to identify TBIs.","Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI), listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a major cause of death and disability1 affects more than 50 million people annually, resulting in significant socioeconomic burden globally.2 Defined as ‘an alteration in brain function, or other evidence of brain pathology, caused by external force’, TBI often has significant long-term sequalae.3
In recent years there has been a change in the epidemiological patterns of TBI. With falls having overtaken road traffic accidents as the most common cause of TBI in Europe, the age of people injured with TBI is on the rise.4,5 As the population progressively ages in high-income country settings, a similar rise in the proportion of elderly patients has been seen in the facial fracture population.6-8
To improve the prognosis of patients who have sustained a TBI, early diagnosis is critically important. Rapid intervention, such as reversing anti-coagulation, is essential to minimise the potential for long-term complications such as morbidity or death. We have previously observed that 15% of facial fracture patients sustain a TBI and that elderly patients have over twice the odds for TBI compared with younger adults.9 Existing literature suggests that the possibility of TBI should always be considered when encountering a facial fracture patient. Previous studies reveal that a facial fracture can be considered a significant indicator of TBI.10 Nevertheless, a large data gap remains on specific injury patterns of facial fractures and associated TBI. In addition, any association between other concomitant injuries and TBI in facial fracture patients remains under studied.
Overall, associated injuries (AIs) are fairly common in facial fracture patients. It can be hypothesised that facial fracture patients with AIs in the head and neck region are more prone to sustaining a TBI when compared with patients sustaining AIs outside the head and neck region or patients without AIs. The aim of this study was to report on the occurrence of TBI in patients with facial fractures. The specific aims were to: 1) estimate and compare the frequency of TBI in patients with and without different types of AIs and, 2) identify risk factors associated with TBI in facial fracture patients. It was hypothesised that TBIs are more common when associated injuries in the head and neck region are present and that different predisposing factors for TBI would be found in facial fracture patients.
Material and methods
Study design and sample
A retrospective cohort study on patients with mandibular and/or midfacial fractures admitted to a tertiary trauma centre (Töölö Trauma Centre of Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland) between 2013 and 2018 was conducted. Included were patients who were at least 18 years old and who had undergone computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Excluded were patients who had solely upper facial fractures (such as fractures of the frontal sinus, superior orbital rim, or orbital roof).
Study variables
The primary outcome variable was TBI with radiological finding in CT/MRI. Cases presenting mild TBI (mTBI) without radiological findings were excluded.
The primary predictor variables were AI outside the head and neck, associated cranial fracture, and associated neck injury. AIs outside the head and neck included injuries of the upper- and lower extremities, chest, pelvis, spine (excluding cervical spine), and abdomen. Associated cranial fracture was defined as fractures of the skull, skull base, and the upper facial third. Associated neck injuries included the cervical spine, blunt cervical vessel, and laryngeal injuries. Wounds and other superficial soft tissue injuries were excluded.
The controlled variables were grouped into the following categories: sex, age, energy of injury, type of facial fracture and anticoagulant therapy. Energy of injury was categorised high when injuries were caused by road traffic accidents, falls from over three metres, or defined as industrial injuries.11 Type of facial fracture was classified as exclusively midfacial, exclusively mandibular, or combined fracture (such as mandibular + midfacial fractures).
Ethics approval
The study protocol was approved by the Internal Review Board of the Head and Neck Centre of the Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland (HUS/356/2017). The Helsinki Declaration guidelines were followed.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Associations between controlled variables and primary predictors and between controlled variables and outcomes were determined with the Pearson chi squared test. The Wilcoxon test was used to analyse continuous variables. Risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated between outcomes and predictors. Univariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between outcomes and each primary predictor variable. Variables included in the multivariate model were selected based on statistical significance in the univariate analyses or clinical significance. The interactions between predictors and controlled variables were evaluated and included in the model when p < 0.05. The statistical significance was accepted as p < 0.05. Statistical analysis used SAS version 9.4.
Results
In total 1836 patients were identified for the study. TBIs were detected in 365 patients (19.9%), including intracerebral haemorrhages, subarachnoid haemorrhages, subdural hematomas, epidural hematomas, and diffuse axonal injuries.
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the 1836 patients. The majority of patients were male (69.7%). The mean (range) age of patients was 50.6 (18.0-102.5) years. Most injuries were caused by other than a high energy mechanism (83.2%). Exclusively midfacial fracture was by far the most common type of facial fracture (74.7%). AI was detected in 34.9% of the patients. AI outside the head and neck occurred in 16.1% of patients. Associated cranial fracture occurred in 15.1% and associated neck injury in 5.7%. In all, 12.9% of the patients had anticoagulant medication prior to injury.

Table 4 shows the risk analysis between primary predictors and TBI. Associated cranial fracture increased the risk of TBI 4.7 times when compared with patients without associated cranial fracture (95% CI 4.0 to 5.5, p < 0.0001). Patients with associated neck injury had a 2.1-fold risk of TBI as compared when neck injury was absent (95% CI 1.6 to 2.7, <0.0001). Presence or absence of AI outside the head and neck was not significantly associated with the risk of TBI.

Discussion
The present study aimed to estimate the frequency of TBI and to measure the association between different types of AIs and the risk of TBI among a sample of patients with facial fractures. We hypothesised that TBIs are more frequent in patients with AIs in the head and neck region and that there are some other factors predisposing for TBI in facial fracture patients.
The hypotheses were confirmed. Facial fracture patients with associated cranial fracture had a 4.7-fold risk of TBI compared with the absence of associated cranial fracture. Associated neck injury increased the risk of TBI 2.1-fold. Moreover, the odds for TBI increased 2.5 times when the injury was caused by a high energy mechanism and 2.1 times when anticoagulant medication was used. When compared with patients with exclusively mandibular fractures, patients with exclusively midfacial fractures had 1.9 times greater odds for TBI and patients with combined mandibular and midfacial fractures had 2.9 times greater odds. Increasing age was also found to increase the odds for TBI. Facial fracture patients with a confirmed cranial fracture or neck injury should be examined with special care due to the risk of TBI. In clinical work, repeated survey should be targeted especially at high-risk patients to identify TBIs. In addition, if the patient is diagnosed with TBI and a facial fracture, other injuries, especially those of the neck region and cranial bones, must also be actively determined. The study confirms a significant association of facial-fracture-related TBIs in patients with AIs in the head and neck region, but it is noteworthy that roughly every tenth (10.9%) facial fracture patient without other AIs (n = 1195) also had a TBI. It is also notable that in this study, 12.9% of the patients were on anticoagulation medication at the time of the injury. This can be explained by the proportion of elderly patients in the study population.
In the present study, we observed that every fifth patient with a facial fracture suffered an imaging-verified concomitant TBI. Previous studies report significantly varying rates, with 5% to 67% of TBI among patients with facial fractures,12-18 however, these differences in results reflect a discrepancy in the definition of TBI. Many studies lack the precise information of the definition used. In addition, as motor vehicular accidents are a major aetiology for these injuries,19,20 differences in road traffic safety, traffic rules, and regulations partly explain the variation. If mild TBIs without a radiological finding had been included in the present study, the number of these injuries would be higher.
Grant et al reported an overall TBI rate of 67% in facial fracture patients.21 However, only 35% of the patients had documented findings on MRI. The higher occurrence of TBI compared with our study might be due to the difference in inclusion criteria of facial fracture patients. In the current study, patients with solely upper facial fractures were excluded in order to evaluate the risk of TBI in facial fracture patients when associated cranial fractures were present. In the study by Grant et al upper facial fractures such as frontal sinus fractures were included in the facial fracture population, which might explain the higher rate of TBI.21
Several studies have reported that facial fractures can be used as individual clinical markers for TBI 16,22 and that the possibility of TBI should always be considered when encountering a patient with fractures of the facial skeleton.17,23,24 We have previously observed that AIs in general and TBIs in particular are common in facial fracture patients.9 A paper published in 2012 by Puljula et al showed that TBIs associated with craniofacial fractures are at significant risk of remaining unrecorded and that the clinical specialty (other than neurology/neurosurgery) of the examining physician plays a prominent role in this failure.25 Thus, it is crucially important to evaluate all the facial fracture patients multi-professionally, specifically the patients with AIs in the head and neck region to enable early diagnosis and intervention needed for concomitant TBI.
Young adult males suffering high energy injuries have usually been considered as being in the greatest risk of sustaining simultaneous TBI and facial fractures.17,26 Within the progressive aging in high-income countries, changes have been seen in the epidemiological patterns of facial fractures. Several studies have showed an increase in the rate of elderly patients and the percentage of falls has increased as the mechanism of injury leading to facial fractures.6-8 Similar changes have been seen in the epidemiology of TBI. According to Roozenbeek et al the median age of patients experiencing TBI is increasing and instead of road traffic accidents, falls have become the leading cause of TBI.27 In the present study we saw a significant increase in the odds of TBI with increasing age. With increased life expectancy and the elderly population being increasingly active, they have become a notable group of patients in the emergency units around the western world. With pre-existing comorbidities and multiple medication, such as anticoagulant medication, elderly people are at high risk of traumatic injuries and TBIs in particular. In parallel to other studies we discovered that a high energy mechanism of trauma increased the odds for associated TBI significantly.14,21,26 However, it is noteworthy that in the current study nearly two thirds of the patients with associated TBI suffered other than high energy trauma. The potential reason for this relates to falls dominating as the injury mechanism in older patients.
The main limitation of the present study is its retrospective nature, and there is a risk of some of the data being inadequate. In addition, the rates of TBI may have been underestimated as a result of excluding patients who did not undergo brain imaging. These potential underestimates underline the high risk of simultaneous facial fractures and TBI even more.
In conclusion, concomitant injuries in the head and neck region are significant risk factors for TBI in patients with facial fractures. On the other hand, facial fracture patients with and without TBIs often have other injuries especially outside the head and neck region. Therefore, these patients should always be evaluated multi-professionally and a proper follow-up routine should be implemented.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission
The study protocol was approved by the Internal Review Board of the Head and Neck Centre of the Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland (HUS/356/2017). The Helsinki Declaration guidelines were followed. Patient permission not applicable in this study.","This retrospective cohort study examined the frequency and risk factors for traumatic brain injury (TBI) among patients with facial fractures, focusing on how associated injuries (AIs) in the head and neck region influence TBI occurrence. Conducted at the Töölö Trauma Centre, Helsinki University Hospital from 2013 to 2018, the study included 1836 patients aged 18 years and older who had sustained mandibular and/or midfacial fractures and undergone CT or MRI of the brain. Patients with isolated upper facial fractures were excluded to refine the analysis.

The primary outcome was imaging-verified TBI, excluding cases of mild TBI without radiological evidence. Predictor variables included AIs outside the head and neck, associated cranial fractures, and associated neck injuries. Controlled variables comprised age, sex, injury energy, type of facial fracture (exclusively midfacial, exclusively mandibular, or combined), and pre-injury anticoagulant therapy. Overall, TBI was detected in 365 patients (19.9%). Descriptive analysis revealed that the majority of injuries were low-energy and midfacial fractures were most common.

Risk analysis demonstrated that patients with associated cranial fractures had a 4.7-fold increased risk of TBI, and those with neck injuries had a 2.1-fold risk. Logistic regression, adjusting for covariates, confirmed these associations; notably, associated cranial fractures increased the odds for TBI more than tenfold, while high-energy trauma, anticoagulant use, and combined or exclusively midfacial fractures also significantly raised the risk. The study concludes that facial fracture patients, especially those with concomitant cranial or neck injuries, require thorough multi-professional evaluation to ensure prompt diagnosis and management of TBI.","This retrospective cohort study, conducted at a Finnish trauma center between 2013 and 2018, investigates the relationship between facial fractures, associated injuries (AIs), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). The study analyzed data from 1836 adult patients with mandibular or midfacial fractures who underwent brain imaging, excluding those with only upper facial fractures.

The research aimed to determine if AIs, particularly in the head and neck region, increase the likelihood of TBI in facial fracture patients and identify other risk factors. The findings confirmed that associated cranial fractures and neck injuries significantly elevated TBI risk. Additionally, older age, high-energy injuries, anticoagulant use, and specific facial fracture types (midfacial and combined) were identified as independent predictors of TBI. Although AIs outside the head and neck were not a significant risk factor alone, the study emphasizes the importance of multi-professional evaluation for facial fracture patients to detect concomitant TBIs, especially in the presence of AIs, and to identify all other potential injuries.","This research paper investigates the association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and facial fractures, focusing on the frequency of TBI and the role of associated injuries (AIs) in the head and neck region. TBI, a major cause of death and disability, often co-occurs with facial fractures, particularly in elderly populations, where falls have become a leading cause of injury. The study, conducted at a tertiary trauma center in Finland, retrospectively analyzed 1,836 patients with facial fractures from 2013 to 2018, excluding those with only upper facial fractures.",12,2.9s,15.68,,,95,95,5,100,87,85,5,100,72,75,10,90

An observational analytical retrospective cohort study was conducted. The inclusion criteria comprised adult patients with Wilkes IV and V with MRI in T2 sequence undergoing TMJ arthroscopy. The first group included subjects who received discopexy with pins (Level III Arthroscopy), and the second included subjects who underwent disc mobilisation without any fixation (Level IIb Arthroscopy). Variables studied were maximum interincisal opening (MIO), pain, and Signal Intensity Ratio (SIR) index. Data were analysed using the chi-squared test, Fisher?s exact test, the Mann Whitney U test, and the Shapiro-Wilk test. To establish the relationship between the variables and SIR¬†‚â•¬†2, a multivariate analysis was performed using unconditional logistic regression. A total of 50 joints were divided in two groups. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, discopexy surgery with pins (Odds Ratio OR¬†=¬†0.03, 95% [CI] 0.02 to 0.69, p¬†=¬†0.027) was identified as an independent predictor for the non-development of a high SIR score (‚â•2.0) after adjusting preoperative covariates. This study shows changes in the medullary signal in patients undergoing discopexy with resorbable pins. However, more studies are required that correlate quantitative measures.","Introduction
Discopexy by suture arthroscopy has been shown to be effective in improving pain and oral opening over a period of one year, especially in Wilkes II and III.1 Similarly, discopexy with resorbable pins has also proved to be an effective technique, with stable long-term results.2,3 On the other hand, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthroscopy without disc fixation has clinical benefits due to improved disc position and joint lavage.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been a useful tool for the diagnosis of TMJ pathology based on the detailed visualisation of soft tissues.4 Patients with disc displacement present alterations in the bone marrow signal and joint effusion.5 In addition, the relationship of pain with changes in the signal intensity of the retrodiscal tissues and signs of osteoarthritis in MRI has also been described.6 However, the benefit of TMJ arthroscopy has not been studied in relation to visible changes on MRI. Imaging of bone marrow oedema with disc repositioning has not been considered until now. It is possible that disc repositioning not only improves the load on bony structures, but also improves related oedema.
The study aims to evaluate the relationship between arthroscopic disc fixation with resorbable pins and operative arthroscopy with disc mobilisation and its effect on the medullar portion of the mandibular condyle.
Material and methods
An observational analytical retrospective cohort study was conducted, and records were collected from January 2010 to 2020 in the oral and maxillofacial surgery department of Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain. The Ethics Committee approved this study with code CEAS 22-022.
Inclusion criteria were patients over 18 years Wilkes stage IV and V, with a diagnosis of anterior disc displacement without reduction (ADDWoR), no previous TMJ surgery, two-years’ follow up after surgery, with preoperative and postoperative MRI in T2 sequence. Exclusion criteria were male subjects (to be comparable), and subjects with facial trauma after surgery. The first group were subjects who had received pin discopexy, and the second group comprised subjects who had undergone disc mobilisation without fixation. Patients were classified into different groups according to extensive and central disc perforation detected intraoperatively, which prevents disc fixation. When this finding was positive, the patient was immediately included in the control group. All patients who met the selection criteria were consecutively included and their records were matched by age. All patients received physiotherapy with the same indications.7 Subjects were diagnosed and classified following the Wilkes-Bronstein Classification.8
Magnetic resonance image analysis
The MRI was performed using a 1.5 Tesla MR imager. Bilateral T2 TMJ images were obtained at both closed and open-mouth positions by using a fast-spin echo sequence. The postsurgical MRIs were taken two years after arthroscopy. Region of interest (ROI) was selected only in images where the entire area between the mandibular condyle and the lower border of the mandible could be imaged and selected by a consensus of two oral and maxillofacial radiologists. The average area for condylar marrow was calculated from 60 images (both preoperative and postoperative images) to obtain the average size of the ROI. This measure was established as 4.5 mm2 of ROI on the top area of the mandibular condyle, as suggested by the protocol of Yamamoto. Additionally, a ROI was defined and placed over the grey matter of the brain (a low variable anatomical area to be contrasted with the bone of the medullary condyle area) as close as possible to the condyle with an area of 5.9 mm2,9 (Fig. 1). The signal intensity ratio (SIR) was calculated using an index from the signal intensity of the condylar medulla on the established ROI (SIC) and the signal intensity of grey matter on the established ROI (SIM) as follows: SIR = SIC/SIM.10

(a) In presurgical magnetic resonance imaging analysis, the green arrow shows anterior disc displacement without reduction. The black circle shows the region of interest in the condylar head with high signal intensity. The black circle on the brain shows the region of interest located in the grey matter of the brain. (b) Postsurgical magnetic resonance imaging analysis, red arrow shows temporomandibular joint disc in the correct position. The white arrow shows the improvement of the medullary signal intensity of the condylar head.
Bone marrow oedema is usually interpreted as a decreased proton density signal and an increased T2 signal. However, as a reference to the pre-surgical state with respect to the signal intensity ratio of the mandibular condyle, the value found by Yajima et al, in patients with osteoarthritis (mean SIR 1.35) was considered.10 However, in this study we considered two stages (SIR >2.0 and SIR <2.0) of the SIR to stratify the marrow changes in high or low stages.
Surgery
Arthroscopic disc fixation with resorbable pins (Level III)
A 1.9 mm and 30° approach arthroscope were used. In the discopexy group with pins, the resorbable pins used were SmartNail® (CONMED, Linvatec Biomaterials), 1.5mm x 16mm in size made of a polylactic acid copolymer. The same surgeon (RMG) performed surgery on all patients using the same protocol for both groups. After placing the second cannula in the anterior recess, a capsulotomy was performed using a coblator device to free the disc from its anterior insertion. This manoeuvre allowed mobilisation of the disc backward using the operative cannula. The botulinum toxin was infiltrated using a metallic 22G spinal Chiba needle calibrated every 10 mm to avoid inserting it any deeper.11 The posterior band of the disc was then compressed with a straight probe, allowing the reduction of the disc into its correct position. In the group with pins, an additional step was performed: a third double window cannula was inserted in a posteroinferior point used to stabilise the disc, drill, and insert the pin. Once the probe held the disc in place, the resorbable pin was impacted on the posterior and lateral portion of the mandibular condyle after drilling both the disc and condyle with a calibrated K-wire (1.5 mm width, not deeper than 20 mm). Before inserting the pin, bleeding through the hole was checked to assess the correct insertion of the pin into the depth of the bone (Fig. 2).

Abbreviations: d: Disc; K: k-wire; b: bone marrow bleeding; P: resorbable pin, w: window cannula.
Advance operative arthroscopy without disc fixation (Level IIb)
Once the arthroscopic visualisation of an extensive and central disc perforation was identified with no possibility of disc manipulation, the second cannula was introduced in the anterior recess and a capsulotomy and myotomy were performed using a coblator device to free the disc from its anterior insertion. Subsequently, regularisation of the edges of the perforated disk was carried out and adherence ablation completed to improve the disc mobilisation. In the posterior recess, a coblation procedure of the retrodiscal tissue was performed to pull back the disc without fixation.
Statistical analysis
The data analysis was conducted using Stata 14 software, and the graphic representation was performed using GraphPad Prism, version 6.0. Analyses were carried out to compare effusion, SIR, maximum interincisal opening (MIO), and pain between groups with and without absorbable pins, as well as within-group variations before and after arthroscopy. Predictor variables were discopexy with resorbable pins or disc repositioning without fixation with resorbable pins. The outcome variable was SIR index and secondary variables were MIO, effusion, and pain.
For the comparison between the technique with pins and postoperative SIR ≥2.00, an analysis of absolute and relative frequencies was performed using Fisher’s exact test and the chi-squared test.
Furthermore, for all the analyses of quantitatively dependent variables (SIR, MIO, and pain), data distribution was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Accordingly, descriptive analysis of these variables was conducted using median and IQR summary measures. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare groups.
To determine the association between the variables (MIO, pain, and effusion) and SIR ≥2.00, a comprehensive multivariate analysis was carried out employing an unconditional logistic regression. For all tests, the significance level was set at p < 0.05.
Results
The study's cohort consisted of 50 joints from 50 female subjects, all of which were unilateral. There were 36 joints on the right side and 14 on the left side. The discopexy group with pins included 25 joints, while the group without pins similarly consisted of 25 joints. Hyaluronic acid (HA) was infiltrated in 42% of the joints, while platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) was used in 58% of the group without pins. In the group with pins, 64% received PRF and 36% received HA, with a p-value of 0.739 between the groups. At baseline, a high SIR (≥2.0) was observed in 50% of the population, 26% of patients reported pain intensity >6, and 100% had MIO >35. The presence of effusion prior to the intervention was evident in 70% of the cases. The postoperative results for the entire cohort are presented in Table 1.

Bivariate analysis based on the primary predictor variable (discopexy with pins) revealed significant differences between the groups prior to surgery in terms of SIR, maximum interincisal opening (MIO), and the side of the joints (p < 0.05). Additionally, bivariate analysis based on the primary outcome (postoperative SIR) demonstrated preoperative differences in relation to the initial SIR. Regarding the other variables evaluated, the groups were comparable. This bivariate analysis indicated that the postoperative SIR was statistically higher in the group of women who underwent disc repositioning without fixation than the group that received discopexy surgery with pins (p = 0.001) (Table 2).

Regarding the bivariate analysis of preoperative clinical variables in relation to the surgical technique, in both groups the initial VAS median was 6 (p = 0.822). The initial MIO had a median of 34 mm IQR (32 to 35) in the group without pins and 33 mm IQR (32 to 34) in the group with pins (p = 0.028). Postoperative results showed a trend towards lower levels of pain (p = 0.064) and greater MIO in the group treated with pins (p=0.005). Regarding image analysis, the initial and final SIR index was statistically higher for the group without pins compared with the group with pins (<0.0001 for the preoperative and postoperative periods). The comparison of the postoperative MIO between high/low SIR showed a statistically higher median in patients with SIR<2, Median: 44 IQR: (42–45) (p = 0.017) (Table 3).

Discussion
One previous study assessed the outcomes of 105 patients who underwent TMJ disc repositioning. The results showed that there were no detectable condylar changes or mandibular positional changes. Nevertheless, headaches and VAS showed a reduction, in conjunction with TMJ noises, disability, jaw function, and diet that also improved significantly.12 Therefore, the position of the disc should not be the only factor to consider in temporomandibular disorder (TMD).
Additionally, there is a biological model that involves bony oedema as a factor that coexists with pain. The increased intra-articular pressure is believed to stimulate nerve endings in subchondral bone, causing pain.13 Bony oedema is another diagnostic variable little considered in the evaluation of TMD. Sano et al found a relationship between pain and marrow oedema evaluated in MRI.14 Also, Higuchi et al suggest a relation between joint effusion and bony oedema with pain.15 In addition, Larheim et al found a relationship between pain and patients with TMD. Additionally, they related effusion and bony oedema as an indicator factor of severity.16
Bony oedema also gains clinical importance, as it is a predictor of necrosis of the bone that causes osteoarthritis.17 This results in a compromise of the microcirculation of the bone marrow, in which venous stasis produces prolonged ischaemia with the alteration of cellular metabolism. This in turn results in necrosis of the bone.18,19 The orthopaedic literature supports the condylar perforation due to decompression of the marrow and revascularisation of the necrotic area.20 The physiological principle is based on changes in the inflow of intramedullary blood that can induce a vascular shunt phenomenon.21
Inflammation of other intra-articular tissues has been studied on MRI with qualitative, and quantitative methods.22 This quantification of the signal of the TMJ tissues in MRI has been described. A classification of bony oedema has been proposed, in which characteristic patterns of the condyle signal have been defined.16,17 However, it has the disadvantage of being qualitative and subsequently it can become subjective according to the clinician’s criteria.6,23 Consequently, other quantitative methods of the mandibular condyle medullary signal have been developed.10 This method has been used to quantify the radio index of the signal from different tissues such as the retrodiscal ligament, the medullary condyle, and intra-articular effusion.24–26 This, in turn, has facilitated a more accurate assessment, establishing the intensity of the signal tissue as a biological assessment when comparing different regions of interest to get information about the area’s health and set an index, it is the reason why the signal intensity of the grey matter is part of the test.
Arthrocentesis combined with stabilising occlusal plates was performed, in which an improvement in symptoms and mandibular function was evidenced. However, there was resolution of marrow oedema in only 25% of the population.27 This suggests that there were favourable clinical outcomes, but evidence of bony pathology persisted on MRI. This could determine a weak therapeutic prognosis factor if other aspects are not managed. To date, there is no evidence of the influence of arthroscopic pin discopexy on condylar bone marrow. The current study showed a decrease in SIR in all cases treated with this technique, demonstrating a change in bone marrow oedema, comparing two groups (disc fixation and disc mobilisation), and establishing the progression of those techniques with modification of the bone marrow.
Previously, an arthroscopic discopexy study with sutures found an incidental postoperative avascular necrosis in the medullary condyle. The author attributes this complication to excessive anterior disc release during the lateral pterygoid myotomy. This, in his opinion, could lead to the disinsertion of muscle fibres, which causes vascular congestion and a change in the signal of the post-surgical condyle.28 In our study, the technique of capsulotomy and application of botulinum toxin was used to minimise intraoperative complications such as bleeding and the possible medullary changes due to decreased irrigation.
Arthroscopic discopexy with resorbable pins, was described by McCain and Hossameldin.29 Subsequently, a report on this technique used in the TMJ was published by Goizueta-Adame. In the postoperative MRI, changes in the intensity of the condylar medullary signal were reported. Unfortunately, the intensity of the signal was not quantified in the pre-surgical stage to establish a pattern.30 These results are like those reported by Martin-Granizo and Millón-Cruz, in a one-year follow-up study with this technique.2 They presented a 72% decrease in pain and improvement in MIO 22%. Regarding medullary changes, they were only reported in response to pin placement. A second report by the same authors at five years of follow up, the patients presented an 88% reduction in pain and improvement in MIO of 9.5 mm.3 As evidenced, resorbable pins seem to show good clinical results but no evidence of change in the bone marrow.
To date, there are no reports that we know of that quantify the SIR of bone marrow before and after arthroscopic discopexy and compare it with a group without bone marrow manipulation. In our study, we intended to evaluate the impact of absorbable pins on medullar oedema in the bone of the condyle. However, from the beginning of the study, it was found that the patients who underwent the technique without pins were those who presented a higher SIR, which did not allow clear results to be obtained regarding the problem question. Nevertheless, the results of the study suggest that submitting a patient to a pin discopexy technique represents a protective factor for the presence of postoperative condylar medullary oedema. Additionally, the pin technique showed better clinical results especially with respect to MIO. Considering the above, discopexy with pins could improve the bony conditions of the TMJ and some clinical variables such as maximum mouth opening. In the authors’ experience, these findings represent a positive and predictive impact of this technique. Still, we do not recommend one technique over the other since each of the techniques has its indications and, in this case, they were based on the presence or absence of disc perforations. Finally, further studies should be carried out in the future that consider medullary oedema as an imaging variable from the beginning, with a much more homogeneous and larger sample. Also, more studies should be carried out to establish a unified intensity signal of the bone marrow to set a quantitative value in healthy patients and patients with TMD.
Among other disadvantages that this study could have would be the small sample size and the differences in severity of the pathology. The selection of a female population could be considered a strength of the study due to the homogeneity of the sample and the reduction of derived biases.

Conducted as a retrospective cohort study from January 2010 to 2020 at Hospital Clínico San Carlos in Madrid, Spain, the study included 50 unilateral TMJs from female patients over 18 years old diagnosed with anterior disc displacement without reduction (ADDWoR) in Wilkes stages IV and V. Patients were divided equally into two groups: one underwent discopexy using resorbable pins, while the other received advanced arthroscopic disc mobilization without fixation, with technique selection influenced by intraoperative disc perforation.

Preoperative and two-year postoperative assessments were performed using 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in T2 sequence. Regions of interest were defined on the condylar medulla and the brain’s grey matter to calculate a signal intensity ratio (SIR), which served as an indicator of bone marrow edema. Alongside imaging, clinical parameters including pain (via VAS), maximum interincisal opening (MIO), and joint effusion were recorded.

Results demonstrated that patients treated with resorbable pins had significantly lower postoperative SIR values, suggesting a reduction in condylar bone marrow edema, as well as improved MIO and a trend toward decreased pain compared to the non-pin group. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the pin technique was an independent protective factor against high postoperative SIR. The study concludes that while each technique has its indications, arthroscopic discopexy with pins may enhance TMJ bone health and clinical outcomes, warranting further research to standardize imaging criteria and validate these findings.","This retrospective study investigates the effect of arthroscopic temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery, specifically discopexy with resorbable pins versus disc mobilization without fixation, on the mandibular condyle's bone marrow.

Patients were divided into pin discopexy and disc mobilization groups based on intraoperative findings.

The results indicated that discopexy with pins was associated with a significantly lower post-operative SIR compared to disc mobilization alone. Discopexy with pins was identified as a negative and independent predictor for the development of a high SIR score postoperatively.

The narrative of this paper follows three domains: myogenous and arthogenous pain, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and reconstruction. The principles of treating mild TMD in children are similar to those in adults, with even more emphasis on the management of psychosocial issues and self-care. The use of medication, however, needs to be more cautious. Symptomatic disc displacement should be treated to reduce inflammation, so early arthrocentesis or arthroscopy is relevant. Controversy exists on disc repositioning to reduce or even reverse condylar degeneration in the growing condyle. If undertaken it should ideally be performed arthroscopically by surgeons with significant experience. Arthritic disease is usually associated with JIA so a multidisciplinary approach is the focus of treatment. The role of arthroscopy in the management of symptoms is increasing but it does not prevent disease progression. Surgical correction may be required for secondary deformity. Reconstruction remains a challenge with no ideal autogenous method. Alloplastic joints are gaining popularity, but the long-term outcomes are unknown. Surgery can be undertaken with minimal morbidity, and the use of joint replacements, even as space maintainers, may therefore be more beneficial than repeated failed autogenous treatments.","Introduction
The spectrum of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in adults and children is similar. In contrast to adults, children usually present due to facial deformity, asymmetry, or functional disturbance, which can be associated with a congenital/developmental or acquired growth defect (Table 1). These disturbances can be mild to severe and often require a long-term coordinated plan with multiple interventions facilitated by a multidisciplinary team (MDT.) This will frequently involve temporomandibular joint (TMJ) reconstruction, which will be discussed. The full management of such conditions is, however, beyond the scope of this article and has been described elsewhere.1

The aim of this narrative review is to discuss recent opinion on conditions that present with temporomandibular pain in children, which are becoming more commonly encountered in routine secondary care maxillofacial clinics.
Method
A review of the paediatric TMJ literature published from October 2020 to October 2023 was undertaken, concentrating on three principle areas: myogenous/myofascial pain, arthrogenous pain (including juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)), and reconstruction. A MEDLINE and EMBASE search of the literature from the past three years only identified 261 papers. Following the exclusion of duplicates and inadequate relevance, 89 were selected, of which 52 full texts were assessed and 41 included (Fig. 1). Whilst historical landmark publications were used as a benchmark, the focus was on recent literature and current thinking in the management of paediatric TMD. As the topics chosen covered the entire spectrum of paediatric TMD, a systematic review or meta-analysis was not possible, and a narrative review was undertaken.

Fig. 1 Flow diagram of literature search.
Myogenous temporomandibular pain
Temporomandibular dysfunction is the second most common musculoskeletal complaint following lower back pain.2 The research-focused classification ‘Diagnostic criteria for TMD (DC/TMD)’ defines myalgic pain as pain of muscular origin that is affected by movement of the jaw, function or parafunction that can be replicated with provocation of the muscles of mastication. The DC/TMD define myofascial pain as pain of muscular origin as described in myalgic pain, but the pain spreads beyond the site of palpation and is confined to the boundaries of the muscle. Myofascial pain with referral is pain that spreads beyond the boundaries of the muscle. The literature on the understanding and treatment of myogenous/myofascial pain is relatively poor, and this is even more pronounced in the paediatric population.3
The incidence of myofascial pain is 11%.4 A longitudinal study found that this was increased in the female population,5 but did not conclude why there was a difference, and the authors hypothesised that genetic, hormonal, and psychosocial factors may be at play. The difference in the incidence between the sexes is highest during adolescence.6 Adolescents with a high hospital anxiety and depression score,7 and those exposed to bullying, violence, and sexual assault, have significantly higher odds of having TMD-related symptoms.8 The role of malocclusion in adolescents has been debated in the literature, and those with an increased overjet and overbite are statistically more likely to experience TMD.8
When investigating a child presenting with TMD, imaging should be reserved only for patients in whom the differential diagnosis is unclear. Missed diagnoses of JIA, idiopathic condylar resorption, or ankylosis may have severe consequences. As per the latest recommendations by the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (AAOMR) and the American Academy of Orofacial Pain (AAOP), no imaging should be undertaken for a clear diagnosis of myofascial pain.9 In children and adolescents, a screening orthopantomogram (OPG) may still be a valuable tool for the identification of asymmetry or clear condylar change, as well as the developing dentition. Repeated radiographs should be avoided.
A review article from 2019 was unable to achieve any evidence-based guidelines due to an absence of studies specifically on the paediatric population with TMD.3 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for TMD in patients aged 12 and upwards are summarised in Table 2.10

Within in the literature for paediatric patients there is conflicting evidence as to whether occlusal splints have any benefit.11–13 As per adults, there may be some benefit in patients with a clear clenching or bruxism habit, and simple splints can be considered. The use of splints that may alter the occlusion is to be avoided. Due to the developing dentition, splints may need frequent change as teeth erupt and exfoliate. Conclusive evidence in a well-designed randomised controlled trial as to whether botulinum toxin offers any therapeutic effect in patients with myofascial pain is yet to be seen; this is the same for children, with only one case report being identified.14 Within the adult population there are studies on therapeutic ultrasound, low-level laser, and dry needling for myofascial pain, but within the time frame of this literature search, no articles were identified to support these in children. Weight and age-adjusted medications other than simple analgesia should be carefully balanced against potential adverse side-effects. Benzodiazepines are generally best avoided, and low-dose tricyclic medication (see Table 3 for dosing) and neuropathic pain medication should be prescribed only by specialists, appropriate paediatricians, or chronic pain specialists.

To summarise, current best practice is similar to that of adult practice, with a need to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any destructive pathology, and to take a detailed history and perform a thorough clinical examination. Imaging is required only where doubt exists, but may be required to screen for dental development. The current NICE guidelines for adult treatment provide a suitable framework for management. The identification of psychosocial or family issues is important, with early referral back to the general medical practitioner or other health professionals to try to prevent the development of chronic pain.
Arthrogenous temporomandibular pain
As in adults, distinguishing myogenous and arthrogenous pain is crucial to the management of patients and can be extremely difficult, especially in children with combined disease. A careful history to include systemic features and associated disorders is important. Examination should include articular loading tests such as the Mahan test (biting on a tongue depressor on the contralateral side elicits pain).
The predominant cause of true articular pain in children is JIA, but an increasing number of adolescents appear to be presenting to clinics with hypermobility, subluxation, or symptomatic disc displacement. In adults, there is a paradigm shift towards the management of intra-articular pain and dysfunction, which infers disease progression based on synovitis, capsular impingement, and symptomatic disc displacement.15 In adults, anterior disc displacement without symptoms is regarded as a poor indication for intervention and within normal variation. Recent evidence suggests that even asymptomatic anterior disc displacement in growing condyles may lead to degeneration of the condyle, which could be indistinguishable from JIA.16 This has led to some authorities17 suggesting that arthroscopic disc plication in children is beneficial to condylar growth. Whilst the evidence for this is evolving, such treatment should be done only by skilled surgeons ideally via arthroscopic techniques.
The number of adolescents presenting with subluxation or hypermobility of the TMJ seems to be increasing. In part this may be linked to primary myogenous disease but it is also due to an increased awareness of hypermobility and Ehlers Danlos syndrome.18 Children therefore should be actively questioned about hypermobility elsewhere, but also about other systemic manifestations such as tissue elasticity, poor wound healing, gastroparesis, and postural hypotension.
A specific subset of patients with no systemic disease present to accident and emergency departments with apparent jaw dislocation. Often they are female, have a history of frequent emergency department attendances, and frequently present around the time of stressful life events. A diagnosis of dislocation is made in many and they are treated for this in the emergency department; only after frequent visits are they highlighted to the local maxillofacial service. These patients do not actually have a true dislocation so there is a role for plain radiographs to confirm the condylar position in relation to the articular eminence. Indeed many will present with restricted mouth opening and clear jaw deviation due to lateral pterygoid muscle spasm. At present we know of no literature that determines the frequency and best management of such patients, and cases are best regarded as a muscular subluxation issue, often related to significant psychosocial pressure. Acute management revolves around early recognition of such patients to avoid frequent “jaw relocations” and avoid the use of intermaxillary fixation. The use of muscle relaxants and outpatient review emphasising the muscular spasm element can be an important first step. This needs to be followed by family and patient education. Some patients will benefit from botulinum toxin injections into the lateral pterygoid muscle, but long-term management involves addressing the psychosocial issues.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)
JIA is the most common rheumatic disease within the paediatric population, with an incidence in the UK of 5.61:100,000 and prevalence of 43.5:100,000.19 For a diagnosis to be reached, one joint should demonstrate chronic inflammation for six months before the age of 16. JIA has been classified into seven subtypes, each with a varying initial six-month course.20 All joints can be affected and this can be paired with systemic features such as fever and rashes. When seeing a patient with suspected JIA one must be mindful that ophthalmology specialists are involved early, as potentially sight-threatening sequelae may occur due to chronic anterior uveitis, which occurs in 8% - 30% of patients.21 As part of the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society standards in JIA care, all patients should have access to a maxillofacial surgeon experienced in the management of JIA and linked into the local clinical network.22
The TMJ does not initially present with the classic signs of larger joints, such as swelling, effusion, and stiffness, and this can lead to a delayed diagnosis. Whilst pain is frequent, silent disease is also commonly encountered. A delay can lead to condylar head destruction, which presents with the classic high-angle, bird-face deformity with an anterior bite if both joints are affected, potentially leading to obstructive sleep apnoea. In unilateral disease a chin point shift to the affected side may be present.
The patient may present with pain on opening and/or during function, morning stiffness and, in severe disease, a progressive malocclusion and/or ankylosis. Objectively there may be reduced maximal interincisal opening, chin point deviation, malocclusion with a shift in the dental centreline, and poor oral hygiene secondary to upper limb involvement (causing poor brushing) or due to reduced mouth opening.23 Chronic disease, pain, and facial deformity, which can all lead to psychological stress and reduce quality of life, also reduce compliance with therapies.24 During consultation with these patients the need for psychological support can be vital and a wide MDT is needed.
All patients with JIA should have a full set of baseline bloods taken (including renal and liver function) prior to the commencement of pharmacological agents. Although taken as routine, biomarkers including C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF), and antinuclear antibody (ANA), are not pathognomonic of JIA. Of patients with a diagnosis of JIA, 30% of those who are ANA-positive will develop anterior uveitis.25
Due to the potential lack of TMJ symptoms and signs and equivocal blood biomarkers in relation to the severity of joint disease, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is recommended in the guidelines by the AAOMR and AAOP.9 This is in contrast to the Temporomandibular Joint Juvenile Arthritis Working Group (TMJaw) which recommends magnetic resonance imaging-gadolinium (GD-MRI) as the investigation of choice.13 A CBCT will demonstrate erosions of the condyle/fossa, flattening of the condylar head, osteophyte formation, and subchondral cysts. Its advantage is the relative speed at which it can be performed, whereas an MRI may require sedation or a general anaesthetic. However, GD-MRI is far more sensitive to early inflammation and arthritic changes, and should be regarded as the gold standard. At present ultrasongraphy of the joint has a limited sensitivity to detect TMJ inflammation and is therefore not of clinical value until further studies are conducted.
The mainstay of treatment for such patients is via rheumatologists, although combined clinics with maxillofacial surgeons for severe cases are extremely useful both in attempting to reduce disease progression and offer symptomatic relief.
Adequate analgesia should be given to all patients. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAI) reduce inflammation of the affected joint but do not halt disease progression. Methotrexate is the most common disease-modifying drug for long-term control, reducing destruction of the TMJ and the subsequent associated sequelae. In non-refractory cases the rheumatology team may consider starting anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) (for example, etanercept, adalimumab), interlukin (IL) inhibitors (for example, tocilizumab26), or a Janus kinase inhibitor (for example, tofacitinib). The nuances of these systemic pharmacological therapies are beyond the scope of this paper, but the impact on OMFS surgeons is a reduced burden of patients presenting with end-stage disease and requiring surgical intervention.27 Previously there were papers discussing the use of iontophoresis, a transdermal medicated patch applied with an electric current passed through to aid deeper absorption; we know of no further papers investigating this method in the past three years.28 It is the requirement for repeated treatments that has made it difficult to undertaken in children.
With the aim of aiding normal development, the use of orthodontic appliances in the growing mandible, which can be associated with pain relief rather than exacerbation, can minimise future occlusal discrepancies. Active appliances and twin block or distraction splints can counteract the growth disturbance of the destruction of the mandible, aiming to achieve a class I skeletal base or reduce the severity of a class II malocclusion.13,29 These appliances add an extra treatment burden and therefore the risks and benefits need to be considered, especially in patients who are having repeated appointments for poorly controlled systemic symptoms.
Surgical management of JIA
Short-term relief from symptoms can be achieved with TMJ arthrocentesis/arthroscopy (by washing out the joint), the temporary removal of inflammatory mediators TNF and IL, and reducing free radical oxidative stress.30 Prior to the search criteria for this paper, three groups published on lavage of the joint31–33 and each found improvements in symptoms. Alongside lavage, glucocorticoids have been injected into the joint, remaining a first-line therapy as per the guidelines of the American College of Rheumatology.34 The TMJaw steering group, however, recommends a cautious approach to their use.13 In skeletally immature patients, repeated injection is not recommended due to the suppression of mandibular growth, but it may help as a one-time treatment for patients with refractory pain and symptoms. In the skeletally mature group, there are concerns about repeated injection causing heterotopic bone formation and intra-articular calcification.35
Correction of the underlying skeletal and occlusal deformity is generally left until the patient has reached skeletal maturity. There are two pathways for treatment: preservation of the TMJ or reconstruction. The latter will be discussed in the last section of this paper. There is true clinical equipoise between these modalities and some cases will require a combination of the two.
Orthognathic surgery, Le Fort I osteotomy, or bilateral sagittal split osteotomy are the most common procedures.36 The concern is that they may worsen the disease state of the TMJ, so caution should be taken with patients with unstable disease or poorly remodelled condyles. Close liaison with the rheumatology team and recent GD-MRI to assess disease activity and stability are essential.35 In patients with stable disease, good results can be gained with orthognathic surgery alone.37,38
Reconstruction
Reconstruction of the TMJ can be challenging in adults and particularly so in children. Historically treatments have involved interpositional arthroplasty using temporalis fascia or fat, and autogenous bone grafting and distraction osteogenesis to elongate the mandible or produce a neo-condyle. The principle method in the paediatric population worldwide has remained the costochondral rib graft.39 There are now emerging case series and reports of paediatric patients receiving a TMJ replacement.40–42
The fundamental difference between children and adults is the challenge of growth. Growth of the facial skeleton relies on all the facial subunits, and disruption of one of these will lead to impaired growth of the adjacent unit as per the functional matrix theory.43 The condyle, which is also a secondary growth centre of the paediatric mandible, therefore poses a particular challenge when it is traumatised or diseased or requires resection.43
Autogenous reconstruction
The mainstay of TMJ reconstruction in the paediatric population has been the transfer of bone with its associated growth centre.40 The techniques described can be divided into costochondral grafts, metatarsal grafts, sternoclavicular grafts, and vascularised bone free flaps.
Costochondral grafts
A costochondral rib graft, which includes the harvest of the hyaline cartilage cap, has inherent growth potential due to the cartilage being the growth centre of the rib. This is in comparison with vascularised grafting with a fibula, iliac crest, or scapula, which have limited growth potential.44 The rib graft is said to have good physiological compatibility thereby reducing the chance of reankylosis and heterotopic bone formation. The remaining periosteum and cartilage left at the harvest site means that in 44%-98% of patients the rib may regrow.45 The technique, however, is limited by the unpredictable biological behaviour of the graft with potential overgrowth, resorption, or reankylosis.46,47 Historically the rate of overgrowth was as high as 50%,48 but more recent studies suggest 16.4%.49 Kaban et al suggested limiting cartilage height to 1-2 mm to limit overgrowth.50 In 2021, Lakshmanan et al reported 2-4 mm height with a rate of overgrowth of 4.3% and one case of recurrent ankylosis.51 Their paper does note the relatively short follow-up period of only 18 months. An intermediate outcome study with 20 patients receiving a rib graft with no chin point correction has demonstrated promising results at 30 months with no patients having overgrowth.52 The major issue with costochondral grafts, however, remains their unpredictability and the potential need for repeated revision surgery. Awal et al demonstrated a 58.2% complication rate overall, especially in infective ankylosis cases.49
Historical literature has shown that the costochondral graft can do well, especially in patients with congenital disease such as craniofacial microsomia, but it has a significant failure rate in patients with ankylosis. Indeed current thinking is to avoid the costochondral graft in such patients and to consider alternatives, including simple interpositional arthroplasty with fat grafting, distraction osteogenesis, or alloplastic joint replacement.
Vascularised bone grafts
When previous surgery has compromised the microvascular bed, vascularised bone grafts may be considered.39 The fibula provides the longest segment of bone, therefore multiple osteotomies can be performed and dental implants placed with minimal concerns about limb growth following harvest. Risks include reankylosis (63%), peroneal and sural nerve injuries, ankle weakness, and instability.53 The iliac crest graft provides a good amount of bone stock that is amenable to implant placement with no local growth disturbance. However, the main risks are hernia formation, gait disturbance, and sensory disturbances to the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh. Scapular free flaps, which can be taken as chimeric flaps, provide a good soft tissue bulk, potentially of benefit in oncological resections such as sarcomas. The bone stock is generally unsuitable for implant placement and can cause a local growth disturbance to the scapula. Free flaps provide reliable reconstruction in terms of survival. Malloy et al concluded that these should be reserved for large complex defects but, due to their long recovery times and complications, other reconstructive options should be considered in the first instance.54
Temporomandibular joint replacement (TMJR)
In the adult population, the use of costochondral grafts is reducing. In a survey of 66 surgeons, 95% reported a preference for alloplastic reconstruction, with only 4.5% preferring rib grafts.55 It is accepted that alloplastic replacement is the gold standard for TMJ reconstruction in the adult population.56 The concern about alloplastic reconstruction in skeletally immature patients is the disruption of the functional matrix as per Moss’ theory,57 and the need for revision surgery when the patient grows and/or the joint fails. Some teams have attempted to combat this issue with the pairing of a fibular free flap with a customised condylar component.41,42
Wolford and Kesterke conducted a retrospective cohort study from 1991 to 2019 of 42 patients with JIA (median (range) age at surgery 17.5 (14-64) years). All patients received a custom TMJR alongside counterclockwise rotation of the maxillomandibular complex. All patients had long-term skeletal and occlusal stability and an improvement in the dimension of the oropharyngeal airway.58 Whilst this study was on older children and adults, it has been supported by other reports that have not shown relapse, but instead an improvement in pain, function, diet, and quality of life scores.59–62 The main advantage of a TMJR is the provision of a predictable pathway in terms of occlusion, improved mouth opening, and reduced need for repeated surgery.40 TMJR may also provide a suitable alternative for those in whom an autogenous graft or distraction has failed63,64 whereby the vascular bed has been disrupted and scar tissue formed. Functional rehabilitation is needed and poor compliance from the paediatric patient and their parents can lead to failure or reankylosis.
The consideration of alloplastic joint reconstruction in skeletally immature patients is becoming more common place, but requires careful risk-benefit management with regards to potential growth disruption and longevity of the joint replacement. Technical issues such as the lack of bone stock and presence of unerupted teeth can make such surgery hazardous, but in patients with repeated failed autogenous reconstruction, the predictability of a prosthesis may actually promote better movement and, consequently, growth. At this present time there is a lack of evidence to support the routine use of such devices, but in specialist centres their consideration in an MDT environment seems appropriate.
Conclusion
Traditionally, paediatric TMJ pathology has been focused on congenital and acquired growth defects, and the asymmetry and functional problems they can cause. Much of this is beyond the scope of this article, which aimed to focus on the increasing number of patients presenting to secondary care with more traditional TMDs that are normally associated with adults.
The principles of treating mild TMD in children are similar to those in adults, with even more emphasis on the management of psychosocial issues and self-care. The use of medication, however, needs to be more cautious.
Symptomatic disc displacement should be treated to reduce inflammation, and therefore early arthrocentesis or arthroscopy is relevant. Controversy exists on disc repositioning to reduce or even reverse condylar degeneration in the growing condyle. If undertaken, it should ideally be performed arthroscopically by surgeons with significant experience.
Arthritic disease is usually associated with JIA, and therefore a multidisciplinary approach is the focus of treatment. Arthroscopy’s role in the management of symptoms is increasing but it does not prevent disease progression. Surgical correction may be required for secondary deformity.
Reconstruction remains a challenge with no ideal autogenous method. Alloplastic joints are gaining popularity, but the long-term outcomes are unknown. Surgery can be undertaken with minimal morbidity, reducing the need for multiple operations and risk to the facial nerve. The use of joint replacements, even as space maintainers, may therefore be more beneficial than repeated failed autogenous treatments.

No.","The research project is a narrative review examining temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in pediatric patients, emphasizing both the similarities and distinct challenges compared to adults. Although TMD presents similarly in both groups, children more frequently exhibit facial deformity, asymmetry, and functional disturbances often linked to congenital, developmental, or acquired growth defects. The review focuses on three principal areas: myogenous pain, arthrogenous pain—including conditions like juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)—and reconstructive strategies for the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).

A systematic literature search from October 2020 to October 2023 yielded 261 articles, with 41 ultimately included after screening for relevance. Myogenous TMD, defined by muscle-related pain that can be reproduced on palpation and movement, is common yet under-researched in children, with psychosocial factors and malocclusion potentially exacerbating symptoms. Arthrogenous pain is often associated with JIA, where delayed diagnosis may lead to progressive condylar destruction and facial deformity. Imaging, particularly cone-beam computed tomography and gadolinium-enhanced MRI, assists in differentiating these conditions.

Reconstruction in pediatric TMD remains challenging because of ongoing facial growth. Traditional autogenous techniques such as costochondral rib grafts offer growth potential but are unpredictable, while vascularised bone grafts and emerging alloplastic joint replacements present alternative options. The review emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management, incorporating both medical and surgical interventions. Ultimately, tailored treatment plans that address both physical and psychosocial factors are essential to improve outcomes and quality of life for children with TMD. In summary, the review underscores evolving treatment strategies, emphasizes prompt early intervention, and calls for additional robust research.","This review article explores the current understanding and management of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in children, a growing concern in maxillofacial clinics. The focus includes myogenous pain (muscle-related), arthrogenous pain (joint-related, especially juvenile idiopathic arthritis or JIA), and TMJ reconstruction.

The review emphasizes that TMD in children often presents differently than in adults, and requires a multidisciplinary approach. It highlights the importance of careful diagnosis, ruling out serious conditions like JIA. While imaging is essential in some cases, it should be limited to avoid unnecessary radiation. Current best practices for managing mild TMD parallel those for adults, prioritizing psychosocial factors and self-care, with cautious medication use.

Arthrogenous pain in children is often linked to JIA, and treatment necessitates a rheumatological approach. Early arthrocentesis or arthroscopy is used to treat symptomatic disc displacement and reduce joint inflammation. Reconstruction remains challenging, and although autogenous grafts are traditionally used, alloplastic joint replacements are gaining traction, particularly in cases with prior failed reconstructions and growth considerations.","This narrative review explores the management of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in children, focusing on myogenous/myofascial pain, arthrogenous pain (including juvenile idiopathic arthritis, JIA), and TMJ reconstruction.

An evaluation of oral and maxillofacial outpatient department dentoalveolar consent forms,"Rajendran, S; Rawlins, A; White, L",2024,British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,10.1016/j.bjoms.2024.08.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2024.08.010,"Obtaining informed consent before performing any dentoalveolar procedure is a professional, ethical, and legal obligation. Prior to this work, in this oral and maxillofacial department, no standardised consent process existed for dentoalveolar procedures. A targeted literature review established localised gold standards for dentoalveolar procedures, and retrospective data from 56 dentoalveolar consent forms over a four-week period assessed baseline compliance with these standards. Data analysis identified that risks of dry socket and trismus were documented in only 7% of cases, and maxillary tuberosity fracture was never documented. Thirty-three per cent of lower third molar cases did not include consent for inferior alveolar nerve injury. Findings were discussed in a departmental audit meeting, and a root cause analysis identified memory failure, repetition fatigue, and varying clinician knowledge and experience, as key drivers. The evidence base and localised gold standards were discussed. A standardised, bilingual, triple-copy dentoalveolar consent form was developed, including predefined indications, additional procedures, and risks, in a tick-box format. This form was presented to the Department of Patient Safety and Quality and gained local approval. Cases completed with the new form will now be evaluated against the localised gold standards, with a mixed-methods feedback survey investigating staff and patient opinions. Local processes for obtaining and documenting valid consent for dentoalveolar treatment were found to be inconsistent and frequently inadequate. Fifteen localised gold standards were set, and a new standardised consent form developed, which will be evaluated for effectiveness and acceptability.","Introduction
Consent is a professional, ethical, and legal obligation. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) provides guidance on consent, stating that ‘seeking consent for surgical intervention is not merely the signing of a form…It requires time, patience and clarity of explanation’. The General Medical Council (GMC) guidance on decision making and consent reflects ethical principles that underpin good clinical practice consistent with the law. The landmark ruling from Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board deemed that patients must be informed of all material risks, with materiality defined as whether a reasonable person in the position of the patient would think the risk significant.
There is also a financial impact to the National Health Service (NHS) when the consent process is not robust. NHS Resolution recorded 1122 claims against oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMFS) between 2010 and 2020, at least 10.9% of these being due to failure to warn patients of the risks associated with a procedure. Claims related to nerve damage were the most expensive, with £8,033,737 paid in damages. Those arising from dental damage contributed to 11.2% of all claims. Importantly, a steady increase in the number of claims over time was observed.1 In this age of increasing litigation, the consent process should be scrutinised particularly closely.
Material and methods
A total of 56 dentoalveolar consent forms completed over a four-week period in the OMFS outpatient department (OPD) at the Royal Gwent Hospital were retrospectively audited. There were no gold standards for risks that should be consented for, and the consent process was not standardised. A targeted literature review was performed to set local gold standards for a standardised consent form.
Results
Data on documented indications and risks were collected to explore whether there were discrepancies and why this was the case. Risks identified in the literature review were compared against the data collected, even if they were not mentioned on any consent forms (Table 1). Following departmental discussion, 15 local gold standards were agreed, as shown in Table 2.

Studies have shown that visual or written material, without audio or oral delivery, substantially reduces patients' anxiety before impacted third molar surgery,2 and patients have a better understanding of the altered sensation risks involved with lower wisdom tooth removal when patient information leaflets are given.3 The provision of preoperative information leads to significantly less anxiety.4 Therefore, where possible, consent should be a two-stage process: in advance, patients should be provided with information verbally and in writing, on options, risks, and benefits to allow them time for consideration, and they should then be asked to confirm their consent in writing on the day of treatment (Gold Standard 1).
When examining the stated indications for dentoalveolar procedures, the wording varied by clinician, however, they could be summarised as ‘removal of a potential source of pain/infection’, ‘to support orthodontic treatment’, or ‘other’. The general risks for a procedure could be listed as pain, swelling, bleeding, bruising, or infection (16% of forms omitted infection, and 4% omitted bruising). With a standardised form these risks can be selected, and important risks such as infection will not be omitted (Gold Standard 2).
Only 7% of consent forms listed dry socket as a complication and the risk percentage was not included. Dry socket occurs in up to 5% of routine dental extractions and up to 25–30% of impacted lower molar extractions. Risk factors also include smoking, surgical extractions, pre-existing infection or pericoronitis, use of a vasoconstrictor, and use of the oral contraceptive pill.5
The difficulty with giving patient-specific risk percentages is that the prevalence can vary depending on the study population, study size, and over time. However, risk percentages allow the patient to make an informed decision. On departmental discussion, it was deemed more appropriate to consent for risk of dry socket (Gold Standard 3) without specifying risk percentages on the form, and to discuss and document any patient-specific risk factors on a case-by-case basis.
Only 7% of consent forms documented trismus as a risk, with no duration specified (Gold Standard 4). Trismus usually lasts for 7–14 days and rarely lasts for longer.6 Risk factors include lower third molar extractions, haematoma in the medial pterygoid muscle post inferior dental nerve block (IDB), and extending the mucoperiosteal flap incision beyond the external oblique ridge.7
Maxillary tuberosity fracture (Gold Standard 5) was not documented as a risk on any form, despite 14% of forms consenting for extraction of upper third molars, and 27% of consent forms consenting for extraction of one or more maxillary first and/or second molars. The incidence rate for maxillary tuberosity fractures varies widely from anywhere between 0.6% and 2.8%, although higher percentages have been reported, and they can be associated with upper first molars as well as upper second and third molars.8 Risk factors include patient age, abnormal root morphology or long/divergent roots, ankylosis, chronic infection, osteoporosis, use of excessive force, and inadequate planning. Complications of tuberosity fracture include haematoma, soft tissue laceration, oroantral communication (OAC), further surgery, splint, and future issues with denture retention.9
Of the consent forms for maxillary molars, 36% documented the risk of OAC (Gold Standard 6) (67% for upper molars and 37% for upper premolars) and only 19% mentioned the need for closure. Forty-eight per cent of OACs are caused by the extraction of upper molars and premolars; other causes include cysts, trauma, osteoradionecrosis (ORN), infection, and sinusitis. Maxillary second molar extractions cause 45% of OACs, third molars cause 30%, first molars cause 27.2%, and first premolars cause 5.3%.10 In defects of >2 mm closure is advised, and complications include oroantral fistula and sinusitis. This is a risk that should be discussed with patients who need upper premolar or molar extractions, as there can be impactful and potentially complicated sequelae.
Fifty-two per cent of consent forms documented retained roots/incomplete removal as a risk (Gold Standard 7), and 9% documented failure of treatment as a risk. Grade III mobile single rooted teeth with uncomplicated root formation were excluded from this analysis. Departmental rates of incomplete removal are currently unknown, but published data suggest that the prevalence of retained roots varies between 15.4% and 37.4% in edentulous patients, between 11% and 20% in partially dentate patients, and is more common with the extraction of left maxillary molars.11
A quarter of consent forms listed the need for surgical extraction as a risk and 7% documented this as an extra procedure. On discussion it was decided that surgical extraction should always be included as a possible additional procedure (Gold Standard 8). This can be explained as 'a cut to the gum and use of a drill to remove bone followed by stitches in the gum’.12 Fifty-nine per cent of consent forms included damage to adjacent teeth or structures. Gold Standard 9 was set as: 100% of consent forms should document ‘risk of damage to other teeth/soft tissue/restorations such as fillings and crowns’.
Alongside the risks mentioned above, there are risks specific to coronectomy, management of impacted teeth, and patients at risk of medication/radiotherapy-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ/ORN), which must be discussed with relevant patients. The departmental expectations for this are set out in Gold Standards 10-13, respectively.
Lower third molar consent forms showed disparities that would benefit from standardisation: 27% of forms consented for extraction of lower third molars, of which 67% documented temporary/permanent numbness/altered sensation in the lingual nerve (LN) and inferior dental nerve (IDN), and 17% recorded risks to the LN only. Seventeen per cent did not record temporary/permanent numbness/altered sensation at all. None of the consent forms documented the percentage risk of nerve injury, and none consented for loss of taste. There was high variation in describing the anatomical areas affected, for example, altered sensation in the lower lip, but no mention of the chin.
Clinicians need to be clear about innervation of the IDN and LN and the risks of temporary and permanent nerve damage, which vary depending on factors such as relation between the lower third molar and IDN, difficulty of extraction, and flap design. Carmichael and McGowan found that the incidence of LN damage was 10.7% at 7–10 days, and 0.6% after one year. The incidence of IDN damage was 3.9% at 7–10 days, and 0.9% after one year.13 The patient can experience a range of sensory impairment such as paraesthesia, dysaesthesia, anaesthesia, and pain.14 The chorda tympani nerve is a branch of the facial nerve which joins the LN near the lower border of the lateral pterygoid muscle within the pterygomandibular space, and transports the nerves of taste for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. LN damage can therefore result in loss of taste.
Lower third molar extraction patients should be warned of the risk of temporary or permanent altered sensation or pain or numbness in the lower lip, chin, tongue, and teeth, and loss of taste (Gold Standard 14). In departmental discussions the possibility of providing complication rates on the standardised form was featured, but it was deemed more appropriate to discuss and record the risk as low, medium, or high, as risk percentages published in dental literature vary, and the true risk level is also impacted by external factors, including operator experience.
Jaw fracture, though rare, is a material risk, with incidences ranging from 0.0034% to 0.29%.15,16 There is an increased risk with deep impaction, long roots, ankylosed teeth, presence of cysts, osteoporosis, pre-existing infection, and use of increased force.17 Gold Standard 15 was set after departmental discussion of the findings of the literature review.
Thirty-six per cent of cases were performed under general anaesthesia (GA). Of these, 38% of consent forms had ‘risks of general anaesthetic in a hospital setting’ documented as a risk. After departmental discussion it was agreed that gaining consent for the risks of a general anaesthetic itself should remain the responsibility of the anaesthetist. This includes damage to dental structures or the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), or the exacerbation of existing TMJ issues caused by intubation or extubation. However, the free-text area on the consent form provides additional space that clinicians may utilise as they feel appropriate for each individual circumstance.
Discussion
Actions
We have proposed a standardised consent form for outpatient dentoalveolar surgery (Fig. 1), which includes the risks identified by the literature review. This form was presented to the Department of Patient Safety and Quality (DPSQ) and gained positive feedback and approval. A Welsh copy was created using the Health Board translation service, which forms sheet two of the triple-copy paper.

Fig. 1 New dentoalveolar consent form.
Initially it was deemed preferable to develop a consent form specific to dentoalveolar surgery, but this will be reviewed after the first trial and gathering of feedback from staff. It is anticipated that the learning from this project will contribute to the development of standardised consent forms for other OMFS OPD procedures, including oral biopsies and cutaneous facial procedures.
It is hoped that the introduction of a standardised form will reduce clinician inconsistency, save clinical time, reduce the risk of litigation, and support clinicians to abide by the clinical, ethical, and legal obligations around informed consent. Its success will be evaluated, and the results published for wider learning. It is our intention that the form can be adapted for use in other OMFS departments.

Recognizing that consent is not merely a formality but a professional, ethical, and legal obligation—as emphasized by guidance from the Royal College of Surgeons, the General Medical Council, and reinforced by the Montgomery ruling—the study underscores the importance of fully informing patients about all material risks associated with surgical interventions. It also highlights the financial implications for the National Health Service, where inconsistent consent practices have contributed to a growing number of litigation claims, particularly those involving nerve damage and dental complications.

The project involved a retrospective audit of 56 consent forms collected over a four-week period at the Royal Gwent Hospital. A targeted literature review was conducted to establish local gold standards for consent, resulting in 15 defined benchmarks. These standards were designed to ensure comprehensive discussion of common risks—such as pain, swelling, bleeding, bruising, infection, dry socket, trismus, and potential nerve injuries—as well as risks specific to procedures like surgical extractions, oroantral communication, maxillary tuberosity fractures, and mandibular fractures. Findings revealed significant discrepancies; for example, risks like dry socket and trismus were inadequately documented, and there was inconsistency in detailing nerve injury risks.

Based on these insights, the researchers proposed a new standardized consent form, including a Welsh translation, aimed at reducing clinician inconsistency, saving clinical time, minimizing litigation risks, and ensuring adherence to ethical and legal obligations. Future evaluations will determine its effectiveness and potential adaptability for other OMFS procedures.","This research paper investigates the consent process for dentoalveolar surgery within an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) outpatient department.

Since then, multiple modifications have been adopted to ensure the preservation of vital structures. With the new era of minimal access surgery, the incorporation of laparoscopic, endoscopic, and robotic surgery is becoming the new normal. Over the years we have carried out neck dissections using minimal access incisions. Although there is no definitive answer about the average nodal yield required in selective or modified neck dissections, it has been reported that the average nodal yield of more than 18 is associated with better survival rate. In this publication we share the results of our three-year retrospective study of 56 patients who underwent minimal access neck dissection. We look at the nodal yield, assess operating duration, complications, outcome with a three-year follow up from a single unit. Our results demonstrate that minimal access neck dissection should be considered in head and neck lymphadenectomies.","Introduction
Crile introduced the concept of neck dissection in 1906.1 The molecular basis of tumour metastasis depends on cell proteolytic enzymes, expression of adhesion molecules, and degradation of the extracellular matrix interactions, which will give the ability to penetrate lymphatics. Furthermore, CD44 expression was also queried as a molecular base factor in head and neck tumour metastasis.2
In the 1950s, Hayes Martin popularised what Crile started at the beginning of the 20th century.3 Bocca, however, in 1967 introduced modifications of the lymphadenectomy process by preventing avulsion of vital anatomical structures;4 however, surgical approaches remained unaltered since Crile and Martin times with only minimal modification.
In modern surgery, minimal access surgical approaches are promoted. New techniques have been developed such as laparoscopic, endoscopic, and robotic surgery. For cervical lymphadenectomy in the last 12 years, varied minimal access and scarless surgery has been reported with its own difficulties and complications.5–7
We have published papers on minimal access surgery with an endoscope for cervical lymphadenectomy in managing thyroid, oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers and simultaneous free flap anastomosis.8,9 Over the last ten years with experience, we have modified our technique to harvest nodes at level I to IV and V using only minimal access without the use of an endoscope. This has been proven to show satisfactory surgical outcome.
We retrospectively reviewed a series with a three-year follow up for surgical access, duration of surgery, nodal yield, motor and sensory nerve complications, aesthetic outcome, recurrence rate and incidence of external nodal extension. The aim of this retrospective study was to look at the nodal yield, duration time, and outcome of minimal access neck dissection.
Patients and methods
We retrospectively collected a conservative series of patients who underwent selective neck dissection by a single surgeon. There were 56 patients with a mean (range) age of 67 (47–91) years. The male (M) to female (F) ratio was 32:24 (57% M; 43% F). The inclusion criteria included patients who underwent selective neck dissection for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (oSCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) malignancies requiring selective neck dissection. The exclusion criteria were simultaneous parotidectomy, patients undergoing neck dissections for malignant melanomas, adenocarcinomas, and bilateral neck dissections where one side involved a standard access neck dissection. Although no formal statistical testing has been done, we used Excel data analysis to calculate the average, mean, standard deviations, etc. Table 1 illustrates data of all 56 patients who underwent minimal access neck dissections with details on the nodal yield, negative nodes (N0) positive nodes (N+) and level of neck dissections. Table 2 describes the patients’ demographics.

Surgical technique for minimal access neck dissection (MAND)
In addition to the usual head and neck instruments the extra additions were a head light (Toffeln UltraView Extreme), 3.5 loupe magnification, Harmonic scalpel (Ethicon) and a long monopolar blade (Gold Vac™ push button, Conmed Corporation).
The patient’s head is extended by placing a sandbag under the shoulders. A 3–4 cm transverse incision is made along the neck crease ending along the anterior border of the sternomastoid muscle. The incision of the platsyma and deep fascia is followed by subfacial dissection. This is carried out superiorly to the lower border of the mandible extending to the angle of the mandible. The next step is to create dissection on the same plane anteriorly, up to the genial tubercle passing the anterior belly of digastric. The third pocket is to create access up to the level IV. For level V nodal harvesting dissection is carried out to the anterior border of the trapezius muscle. The external jugular vein (EJV) and great auricular nerve are preserved. Differential retraction is the secret of this dissection. Once the superior, anterior, inferior, and posterior pockets are created the next step is to identify the accessory nerve. Then the posterior belly of digastric muscle and the internal jugular vein are identified, followed by delivery of level Ila and IIb nodes separately. The next step is to dissect the level Ib followed by Ia and deliver the submandibular triangle contents, preserving the lingual and hypoglossal nerves. Following that, we dissect around the internal jugular vein right down to the omolohyoid and beyond. The vagus nerve and common carotid artery are identified and preserved. This follows removal of the level III and level IV lymph nodes.
Dissection of the level V requires localisation of the accessory nerve, which is followed until it enters the anterior border of the trapezius muscle. The level Vb is removed, followed by the Va. Absolute haemostasis is ensured using the Valsalva manoeuvre and a suitable drain is inserted, followed by a layered repair.
Table 3 illustrates levels of neck dissection for 56 patients with detailed analysis of nodal yield and postoperative sequalae. Types of neck dissection varied from Level I–III to level I–V. Level I–IV was the most common neck dissection that was performed in the unit with average nodal yield of 44.2. Furthermore, 8% of cases had bilateral neck dissections and the average nodal yield was around 33. A total of 37.5% of patients had positive lymph nodes with extranodal extension in 15.8% of cases. Mean surgical time for neck dissection was 90 minutes and, in most cases, (41 patients) drains were removed with five days. There was minimal reported loss of sensation or motor neural deficit. Regional neck recurrence was reported in eight patients within the three-year period.

Discussion
Lymphadenectomy remains the keystone in the management of neck metastases. Despite the advances in surgical technique that were introduced by Crile, Hayes Martin etc, extensive incisions remain a common practice. Kang et al first demonstrated neck dissection through the transaxillary approach for lateral neck dissection.10,11 Kim et al introduced the transaxillary and retroauricular approach for lateral neck dissection.7,11 Lee et al presented their findings using robot assisted supraomohyoid neck dissection, the modified face lift, or the retroauricular approach.7 Recently, there have been many modifications and publications on hidden approaches. Retroauricular and robotic assisted approaches do have benefits but are costly, require a longer duration, and result in more complications, although they have provided invisible scars.12–15
In our series, a small transverse incision, on average 4 cm, which probably produced a better cosmetic outcome in comparison with most sentinel node biopsy access approaches. The patient’s perception of a cosmetic outcome in our series was measured with a visual analogue scale, with an average score of 8–10, during the first three months follow up.
Arora et al investigated patient perception, although they found no correlation between the scar length and patient score satisfaction, but the quality of life in patients with visible scars was poorer compared with those in whom the scar was concealed.16 Our technique gave a balanced benefit where the scar is not hidden but small and there were no concerns about quality of life.
Liang et al reported the feasibility of lymphadenectomy of levels II to IV in 29 patients using an endoscope via a small natural neck incision in the management of early stage (T1 – 2 N0 M0) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.17 The mean (SD) number of harvested lymph nodes was 19.1 (4.1) with an operating time of 68.4 (10.3) minutes.
Kathar et al reported a series of 28 patients using robotic/endoscopy assisted neck dissection with the mean (SD) duration of surgical time was excessive of 231.79 (54.9) minutes in patients with levels I to IV.5 They report this for the learning curve in this surgical practice.
Raj et al published minimal invasive supraomohyoid neck dissection by endoscopic technique with mean (SD) duration of 53.7 (29.8) minutes, however, their technique used CO2 insufflation with associated complications.18
In publications mainly from South Korea, robotic assisted techniques were presented for various neck dissections, however, the drawbacks are the added expenditure, prolonged operative time, and more invasive dissection.19 In our series, the operating duration ranged from 70 to 110 minutes with a mean of 90 and required no additional dissection with minimal associated complications. In our previous publications we used a small incision approach with the assisted use of zero-degree endoscope. With experience, the endoscope in our series had become an unnecessary tool.8,9
It is well known fact that lymph node ratio plays an important prognosticator in survival rate for head and neck oncological patients.20 Although there is no discrete lymph node ratio defining neck dissection; over the years it has been reported that lymph node yield of 18 is associated with a better survival rate.21–23 In our series we had eight patients with a nodal yield of less than 18 with two patients of N+ neck. All these patients had postoperative radiotherapy and/or neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and had no recurrence within three years follow up period. Our nodal yield was higher than the recommended numbers for I–III, I–IV, I–V (Table 3). The extranodal extension was 15.79%.
The dissection in a subfascial plane to create the superior pocket in our series not only prevented injury of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve but gave direct access to the levels Ia and Ib and reduced the operative time compared to the standard subplatysmal approach. Although one person experienced traction weakness of marginal mandibular nerve initially, a complete resolution occurred within three months.
We wait for the drainage collection to be less than 10 ml in twenty-four hours before removing the drain. For patients who underwent neck dissection only, the drains were removed in 2–5 days in the majority with an average of three days.
None of our patients experienced complete accessory nerve weakness on discharge. This remained the same for 50% of our patients who did not have any adjuvant treatment. In those patients who had postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy, shoulder stiffness, despite normal accessory nerve function postoperatively, was observed. This is possibly attributed to chemoradiotherapy effect rather than surgical trauma. We did not have any trauma to the vagus nerve, phrenic nerve, or the cervical plexus in our series.
Seven oSCC and one cSCC patient had regional recurrence amounting to 14.29%. All eight patients had positive neck node (N+) in their neck dissection. Four out of eight patients had a poorly differentiated SCC. Furthermore, three out of eight patients presented with lymphadenopathy in the contralateral neck. Four of these eight patients had simultaneous distant metastases.
In summary, small incision neck dissection in our hands works well in carrying out cervical lymphadenectomy. Sensory and motor nerve deficit as a result of surgery was negligible in our series. The nodal yield is equal or better than comparable publications. No and N+ neck in our series did not prove any difference in the identification of lymph nodes. There is no comparable surgical procedure to our knowledge, and our surgical time is better than previous published figures. Drain removal and patient stay is somewhat prolonged due to other comorbidities and factors. Motor and sensory nerve deficit is negligent in our series. We therefore recommend colleagues to consider this approach with minimal morbidity and considering lymphadenectomy of level I to IV and level I to V in managing oropharyngeal and cutaneous malignancy neck dissections.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission
Ethical Approval was not required for this study. Patient permission was not required for this publication","This research project evaluates a minimally invasive technique for performing neck dissections in patients with head and neck cancers, building on historical methods pioneered by Crile and refined by Hayes Martin and Bocca. The study focuses on a minimal access neck dissection (MAND) method using a small 3–4 cm transverse incision along the neck crease. This approach allows surgeons to access lymph node levels I–V through subfascial dissection while preserving vital structures such as the accessory nerve, external jugular vein, and great auricular nerve. The technique employs standard head and neck instruments augmented by a headlight, 3.5× loupe magnification, a harmonic scalpel, and a specialized monopolar blade.

In a retrospective review spanning three years, 56 patients (mean age 67.1 years, 57% male) with oral squamous cell carcinoma (oSCC) or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) underwent selective neck dissection using this method. The majority of procedures were performed at levels I–IV, achieving an average nodal yield of approximately 44 nodes, with a mean operative time of 90 minutes. The study reports minimal postoperative complications, including negligible motor and sensory nerve deficits, and an acceptable rate of regional recurrence (14.3%), primarily in patients with positive nodal involvement and poorer differentiation. Cosmetic outcomes were favorable, with patients rating their scars highly on visual analogue scales.

Overall, the findings suggest that MAND provides comparable oncologic efficacy to traditional open techniques while offering the advantages of reduced incision size, shorter surgical times, and minimal morbidity. The authors recommend considering this approach for the management of oropharyngeal and cutaneous malignancy-related neck dissections, especially when balancing effective cancer control with enhanced aesthetic outcomes.","This retrospective study investigates the efficacy of minimal access neck dissection (MAND) for oral and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. It reviews data from 56 patients who underwent selective neck dissection via a 3-4 cm transverse incision, using specific instruments but without an endoscope, focusing on levels I-V. The study analyzes surgical access, duration, nodal yield, complications, aesthetics, and recurrence.

Results showed an average surgical time of 90 minutes, with varying nodal yields depending on the neck levels dissected. Postoperative complications like sensory loss were generally minimal, and nerve damage was rare. Regional neck recurrence occurred in 14.3% of patients, all of whom had positive nodes. The authors suggest the procedure is well-tolerated, provides adequate nodal yield, minimizes morbidity, and offers acceptable aesthetic outcomes compared to traditional approaches or more complex minimally invasive techniques. The study advocates for MAND in managing oropharyngeal and cutaneous malignancies, deeming it a balanced and effective approach to cervical lymphadenectomy.","This research paper evaluates the outcomes of minimal access neck dissection (MAND) for cervical lymphadenectomy in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (oSCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC).

In this study, we aimed to calculate airway volume changes, apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), and improvement in quality of life before and after distraction osteogenesis (DO). Fourteen Patients with OSA secondary to TMJ ankylosis at a mean (SD) age of 17.5 (5.43) years were enrolled in this prospective study.

The patients were followed up for six months. A polysomnography test (PSG) was done to quantify AHI and a low-dose computed tomographic scan was done to calculate airway volume using Dolphin medical imaging software pre and post-DO. The QoL of the patients was calculated using the OSA-18 questionnaire.

Airway volume was calculated on Dolphin software before and after DO showed a significant improvement in airway volume by 121.12% (98.30)%. Similarly, the OSA-18 questionnaire showed significant improvement in QoL from severe to normal. This study suggested that DO increases the corpus length of the mandible, leading to an increment in airway volume, which improves the QoL.","Introduction
Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis leads to an acquired deformity of the mandible. This results in reduced mobility, retrognathia, and deranged occlusion leading to the narrowing of oropharyngeal space, which compresses during respiration due to a reduction in space for the tongue,1 results in physical obstruction during respiration, and ultimately causes obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).2 Features are daytime somnolence, decreased concentration, headache, snoring, cessation of breathing while sleeping, and decreased oxygen saturation level.3,4
Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard diagnostic tool for OSA. It measures different variables such as the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI). Thus, daytime sleepiness along with deranged AHI >5, is considered pathognomonic for OSA diagnosis.5 An AHI of 5–15 is considered mild OSA, 15–30 is moderate OSA and >30 is severe OSA.2,6 The condition can be managed by different surgical means such as distraction osteogenesis (DO) and orthognathic surgery. DO of the mandible is considered a successful technique for expanding the oropharyngeal airways of paediatric and adult patients.7 It can lead to significant improvement in airway space and volume with an improvement of the AHI because obstruction of upper airway space is mostly at the level of the tongue base.6,8,9
Chronic deprivation of sleep may result in neuropsychiatric, cardiac, and vascular sequelae. Neuropsychiatric effects cause depression and intellectual dysfunction, which ultimately leads to disturbance in the personal, professional, and social well-being of patients. Cardiac and vascular sequelae consist of systemic hypertension, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and stroke.10 Thus, such effects of OSA on the patient’s general health degrade the overall quality of life. Numerous generic and specific instruments are formulated to measure the QoL of patients. Amongst these, the OSA-18 questionnaire is the one that is most patient-friendly and unique.11 The analysis of OSA patients without TMJ ankylosis has been done previously using either quantitative or qualitative methods but the literature is scarce on the evidence that uses both of these methods for assessing pre- and post-treatment results in OSA patients with TMJ ankylosis. Thus, the present study was proposed to evaluate the changes in upper airway volume and QoL of patients before and after DO.
Material and methods
Study design
To address the purpose of the research, a prospective study was designed and conducted in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in collaboration with the Department of Neurology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS, New Delhi) from January 2018 to July 2019 after getting ethical approval from the Institution Ethics Committee (Ref No-IECPG-5/6/29.11.2017, RT-14/20.12.2017). Fourteen patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study.
Inclusion criteria:
•        
Patients having an acquired retrognathia with unilateral/bilateral TMJ ankylosis with PSG-proven OSA
•        
Ages >7 years
Exclusion criteria:
•        
Patient’s unwillingness to give consent
•        
Medically compromised patients
•        
Immunocompromised patients
•        
Patients with metabolic disorders of bone
Study variables
Baseline parameters were age, sex, aetiology, type of ankylosis, AHI, airway volume changes, and QoL determined using the OSA-18 questionnaire.
Surgical procedure
All patients were operated on under general anaesthesia using nasotracheal intubation. A standard submandibular approach was used. After exposure of the angle of the mandible, an osteotomy line was planned according to the desired vector. Incomplete osteotomy was done with a piezotome, leaving a bridge of bone at the region of the inferior alveolar nerve canal.
A distractor was placed at the desired site and osteotomy was completed using a chisel and mallet (Supplemental figure, online only). After a distractor was placed, it was activated to check the function. The closure was done in layers with 3/0 Vicryl and 4/0 nylon sutures. A standard protocol for distraction12 with a latency period of 5–7 days and a distraction rate of 1mm/day (0.5mm twice daily) was followed. An average distraction distance of 15–20mm and a consolidation period of 3–4 months was maintained. After 3–4 months of the consolidation period, bone formation at the distraction gap was confirmed with OPG and PA cephalogram. The distractor was removed after observing the callus formation before the release of ankylosis.
Outcomes
Airway volume
A preoperative low dose computed tomographic scan (LDCT) was done for the evaluation of upper airway volume with the help of medical image processing software ‘Dolphin’ (Version 11.7; Dolphin Imaging and Management Solutions). The following landmarks were plotted in the software – (Supplemental Figure, online only):
•        
Cephalad -hard palate plane
•        
Caudal -glottis
•        
Ventral -junction of superior adenoid tissue and nasopharynx
•        
Dorsal-posterior pharyngeal wall
•        
Lateral -right and left lateral pharyngeal wall
LDCT was done again after distractor removal for the calculation of upper airway volume postoperatively and was calculated in the software Dolphin using the same landmarks (Supplemental figure, online only). Both preoperative and postoperative data were calculated twice by the same examiner after one week for intra-rater reliability and the average of the two values was taken for the final evaluation.
Apnoea-hypopnoea index
Preoperative AHI was calculated using PSG data and compared with postoperative AHI data after distractor removal (Fig. 1).

Statistical analysis
Stata 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station) statistical software was used for data analysis. Categorical variables were summarised by frequency (%). Quantitative variables were summarised by mean/SD/median (min-max) as appropriate. Various variables such as AHI, airway volume (pre and post), % change in airway volume, sleep disorder, physical disorder, emotional distress, daily problems, the concern of the caretaker, and total OSA had been calculated and summarised. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was done to compare the change in parameters over a period.
A paired t-test was used to test preoperative and postoperative sleep disorder, physical disorder, emotional distress, daily problems, concern of caretaker, and total OSA. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to define intra-rater reliability. A p-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 14 patients (six bilateral and eight unilateral) of TMJ ankylosis with OSA were enrolled. All patients were followed up for six months. Mean (SD) [range] age was found to be 17.5 (5.43) [10–30] years with gender predilection of 10 males and four females (Male: Female = 5:2). The distractors used were multivector in 12 patients and linear in two patients. The mean (SD) [range] anteroposterior distraction of 16.21 (4.37) [9–25] mm and consolidation period of 116.92 (14.35) [96–152] days were considered. After DO, 11 patients developed an open bite, which was corrected by callus moulding with intermaxillary fixation and elastic traction.
Preoperative AHI was 51.44 (37.99) [6.4–113.6] which improved to AHI 9.57 (9.74) [0.5–28.6] (p = 0.001) (Fig. 1). This depicted that there was a significant improvement in OSA post-distraction treatment. Similarly, preoperative airway volume was 3836.14 (2244.63) [1709–9453] mm3 and postoperative airway volume was 7527.42 (3564.24) [3034–16752] mm3 (p = 0.001) (Fig. 2) with improvement in airway volume by the amount of 3691.28 (2190.12) [570–7299] post-DO. This showed substantial progress in airway volume by 121.12 (98.30) % [15.78–352] %. For intra-rater reliability, ICC values varied from 0.999 to 1.00 depicting almost perfect agreement in preoperative and postoperative volume readings, respectively.

Similarly, the preoperative and postoperative quality of life of the patients was calculated using an OSA-18 questionnaire which contained five domains (sleep disorder, physical distress, emotional distress, daily problems, and concern of caretakers). Each domain was given a number and calculated accordingly (Table 2). Subjective preoperative total OSA was 73.85 (10.58) [62–93] (p < 0.001) and postoperative total OSA was 8.81 (13.75) [18 – 35] (p< 0.001) (Fig. 3). This also signified the improvement in OSA from severe to normal after DO.

Discussion
Retrognathia leading to the narrowing of pharyngeal airway space and collapse of the airway during respiration due to reduced muscle tone while sleeping is a major pathogenesis of OSA (Fig. 4). TMJ ankylosis is one of the conditions that produce a severe degree of retrogenia and micrognathia leading to airway compromise (Supplemental figures, online only). Numerous treatment modalities are available for the management of OSA secondary to TMJ ankylosis, DO being one of them.

Fig. 4 Virtual reality tool preoperative image showing reduced chin, severe overjet and osteotomy line at angle of mandible region.
OSA secondary to TMJ ankylosis can be seen in any age group ranging from child to adult irrespective of gender. The mean (SD) age of the patients in this study was 17.5 (5.43) years and the most common cause of TMJ ankylosis was trauma, which occurred mostly in the younger age group and the male population. The present study was in accordance with the above theory as it also included younger age group patients. The males had higher predilection than the females. Young age and male predilection were observed since these groups are more prone to trauma and post-traumatic TMJ ankylosis. The study by Wang Xing et al13 included the mean age group of 21.2 years, and Manikandan et al14 included the age group of 12–23 years correlating with the present study. The mean (SD) amount of anteroposterior distraction was 16.21 (4.37) mm, which depended mostly upon preoperative overjet (range, 8–19 mm) and edge-to-edge bite obtained after distraction (Fig. 5), elongating the linear dimension of the mandible to accommodate the space for the tongue (Supplemental figures, online only).

All patients had undergone preoperative and postoperative overnight PSG for calculation of the AHI index. Before surgery, eight patients showed severe OSA, three patients had moderate OSA, and the remaining three patients had mild OSA after distractor removal; while four patients improved to moderate OSA, three patients to mild OSA, and seven patients were normal. None of the patients was in the severe OSA group after distractor removal showing significant clinical improvement in AHI (Fig. 1). More than 57% of cases had severe OSA before distraction which became normal in 50% of cases and mild in more than 21% of cases after distraction indicating the noticeable improvement in OSA and its symptoms. Wang Xing et al,13 Yadav et al,15 Manikandan et al,14 Abdulfattah et al16 showed improvement in AHI from severe to mild whereas Rachmiel et al,17 and Looby et al18 showed improvement from moderate to normal. In the present study, AHI was improved from severe to mild or normal and was in accordance with the above studies, the reason being that OSA was primarily due to retrogenia, which was corrected by distraction leading to an increase in corpus length and airway volume.
The airway volume was calculated on digital LDCT face data in Dolphin medical imaging software and was analysed (Fig. 2) showing <50% improvement in the airway in two cases, 50%–100% improvement in the airway in six cases, 100% improvement in the airway in six cases and overall improvement in airway up to 121.12 (98.30) % (p = 0.001). This noticeable progress in AHI and airway volume with improvement in symptoms of OSA was correlated with other studies (Arlen Denny et al), showed an increase in airway volume up to 67.5 %,19 Rachmiel et al showed improvement in airway volume up to 71.92%,17 Ahmed Mahrous et al showed the increase in airway volume up to 37%,9 Manikandhan et al showed improvement in airway volume up to 19.3%. Abdelfatteh et al showed improvement in airway volume up to 70.5%,16 Anantanarayanan et al showed improvement in airway volume up to 31.33%,20 Zachary et al showed improvement in airway volume up to 76%,21 and Valerio Ramieri et al discovered increase in airway volume up to 169%.22 The airway volume was markedly increased in the present study with a mean (SD) of 121.12 (98.30) % as compared to the above studies presented, because the patients enrolled were mostly young adults, had adequate consolidation periods, and the volume calculated was before the ankylosis release that provided more stability.
The progress in symptoms of OSA post-distraction markedly enhanced and boosted the QoL of patients which was analysed based on the OSA-18 questionnaire.23 The results of the questionnaire were subjective based on the patient’s answers and were analysed accordingly. A qualitative study showed a significantly severe form of OSA before surgery which after distraction, improved to a minor form of OSA (Fig. 3). The most affected domains were caregiver concern followed by daily problems, sleep disorder, emotional distress, and the least was physical distress.11 However, clinically significant improvements were present in all domains of the OSA-18 questionnaire (Table 2) after surgery (p = 0.0001). Amaury et al,24 in accordance with the present study, showed the affected domain with respect to caregiver concerns followed by daily problems such as daytime sleepiness and difficulty waking up in the morning followed by sleep disorders such as snoring, as reported by the patient and their attendant/parents. An exceptional result was shown for severe OSA cases regarding retrogenia correction and improving airway volume with symptoms while mild OSA cases also showed improvement regarding all the parameters but less than severe cases.
Despite the clinical relevance of the present study, the results must be interpreted with caution. This is because airway volume was manually calculated on the software, which used arbitrary landmarks, and so created a chance of iatrogenic errors in denotation and led to some calculation errors. Long-term follow up of the study should be done also to check airway volume change after the release of ankylosis.
Conclusion
Quantitative as well as qualitative analysis of OSA depicts substantial improvement and both of their results correlate with each other. Thus, it provides strong evidence that DO significantly increases airway volume, improves AHI, and QoL.

TMJ ankylosis, a condition that leads to mandibular deformity including retrognathia and deranged occlusion, significantly reduces oropharyngeal space and predisposes patients to OSA. OSA manifests with symptoms such as daytime somnolence, snoring, headaches, and oxygen desaturation, and is diagnosed via polysomnography with an AHI >5. The study enrolled fourteen patients (mean age 17.5 years, predominantly male) meeting criteria of acquired retrognathia with PSG-proven OSA. Using a standard submandibular approach, patients underwent mandibular osteotomy followed by placement of distractors with a latency period of 5–7 days and a distraction rate of 1 mm/day, achieving an average advancement of 16.21 mm. Preoperative and postoperative assessments included low dose computed tomography (LDCT) for airway volume analysis, PSG for AHI measurements, and the OSA-18 questionnaire to gauge QoL. Results demonstrated significant improvement, with AHI decreasing from 51.44 to 9.57, airway volume increasing by approximately 121%, and QoL scores showing marked reduction in sleep disorder, physical distress, emotional distress, daily problems, and caregiver concerns. These findings suggest that DO effectively restores airway patency, alleviates OSA symptoms, and enhances overall QoL in TMJ ankylosis patients. Limitations include manual calculation variability and short-term follow-up, warranting further long-term studies to validate sustained benefits. Overall, these results confirm DO as a reliable treatment option, improving airway dimensions and sleep quality in TMJ ankylosis patients.","This study investigates the impact of distraction osteogenesis (DO) on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis-induced retrognathia. The prospective study, conducted on 14 patients with PSG-proven OSA, aimed to evaluate changes in upper airway volume and quality of life (QoL) pre- and post-DO.

Patients underwent mandibular DO with a latency period of 5-7 days and a distraction rate of 1mm/day. Airway volume was measured using LDCT scans and Dolphin software. OSA severity was assessed via the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) obtained from polysomnography. QoL was evaluated using the OSA-18 questionnaire.

Results showed significant improvements in AHI, airway volume, and QoL after DO. Preoperative AHI significantly decreased postoperatively, airway volume substantially increased, and OSA-18 scores indicated improved QoL across all domains. The study concludes that DO effectively increases airway volume, reduces OSA severity, and enhances QoL in patients with TMJ ankylosis and OSA.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine, which inhibits fibrinolysis by competitively binding to the lysine receptor domains of plasmin and plasminogen.1,2 TXA is used in the early stage of haemorrhagic trauma to reduce the risk of death,3,4 and also to reduce intraoperative blood loss.5–8 However, few studies have focused on the its postoperative effects in patients with maxillofacial fractures. This study aims to explore the haemostatic effect and optimal usage time of TXA after different maxillofacial fracture surgeries.
Material and methods
Patient selection and grouping
Clinical data were collected from patients admitted to the School and Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University from September 2020 to August 2022. A total of 131 patients with zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures were investigated of whom 87 were excluded (Table 1). A total of 118 patients with mandibular condylar fractures were investigated of whom 72 were excluded (Table 2). Forty-four patients with unilateral ZMC fractures and 46 with unilateral mandibular condylar fractures were included in the study. The unilateral ZMC fractures were divided into tetropod and comminuted tetropod fractures (Table 3). The unilateral mandibular condylar fractures were divided into condylar head, condylar neck, and condylar base fractures (Table 4). The use of TXA in patients with unilateral ZMC fractures ranged from the day of surgery to the fourth postoperative day. It was used in seven cases until the second postoperative day, in 10 cases until the third postoperative day, and in three until the fourth postoperative day. In patients with unilateral mandibular condylar fractures its use ranged from the day of surgery to the fourth postoperative day. It was used in only one case on the day of surgery, in two until the first postoperative day, in eight until the second postoperative day, four until the third postoperative day, and in one until the fourth postoperative day.

Dosage of TXA
Among the patients in the unilateral ZMC group, 18 received 0.5 g twice a day, and two received 0.5 g once a day. Among the patients in the unilateral mandibular condylar fracture group, 15 received 0.5 g twice a day, and one received 0.5 g once a day.
Inclusion criteria
Male and female patients aged between 18 and 77 years who presented with a unilateral ZMC fracture or unilateral mandibular condylar fracture were included. For unilateral ZMC patients, those who had both hemicoronal and intraoral maxillary sulcus incisions were included. Patients with unilateral mandibular condylar fractures who had a preauricular incision were included, as were those treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and application of closed negative pressure drainage.
Exclusion criteria
Patients who had other incisions, those with coagulation disorders or those on long-term anticoagulants, and patients who had received blood transfusions, were excluded, as were those with pathological fractures, or who had had bone grafts, old fractures (fractures > 3 weeks old), and infection at the fracture area.
Patients in both fracture groups were divided into TXA and control groups according to whether or not TXA was used postoperatively. For patients with unilateral ZMC fractures, 20 were given TXA postoperatively, while the other 24 were not. For patients with unilateral mandibular condylar fractures, 16 were given TXA postoperatively and the other 30 were not. The amount of postoperative blood loss was evaluated by daily negative pressure drainage volume. Clinical data were collected on gender, age, negative pressure drainage volume, and complications.
Data processing
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 20.0 (IBM Corp) was used for data analysis. Quantitative data were examined by the Shapiro-Wilk test and the homogeneity of variance test. Data satisfying the conditions were expressed as mean (standard deviation). The independent samples t-test was used for comparison between the TXA and control groups. Data that did not meet the conditions were expressed as median (interquartile range), and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison. The chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare qualitative data. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05 (two-sided test).
Results
There was no statistically significant difference in gender and age between patients in the TXA and control groups. No patients experienced deep vein thrombosis (DVT). No patients with unilateral ZMC fractures experienced orbital compartment syndrome or retrobulbar haemorrhage.
TXA reduced postoperative blood loss in patients with ZMC fractures
In patients with unilateral ZMC fractures, the total volume of blood loss in the TXA group was reduced by approximately 30 ml compared with the control group (TXA group: 78.64 (24.10) ml; control group: 108.71 (43.37) ml, p = 0.006). On the first and second postoperative days separately, blood loss in the TXA group was significantly less than it was in the control group (first postoperative day p = 0.015, second postoperative day p = 0.021). However, on the third postoperative day, there was no statistical difference in blood loss between the two groups (p = 0.461) (Table 5).

Discussion
TXA is beneficial for patients with ZMC fractures
In our study, it was shown that the postoperative application of TXA effectively reduced blood loss in patients with ZMC fractures. Our results are consistent with research on other parts of the body.9–12 However, for patients with mandibular condylar fractures, there seemed to be no such significant haemostatic effect. We speculate that this may be related to the surgical approach. For complex ZMC fractures, a hemicoronal incision combined with an intraoral maxillary sulcus incision is often required. As is well known, scalp tissue is the skin tissue with the most abundant blood supply, and there are multiple anastomotic branches between arteries and between veins.13 Even with electrocoagulation, scalp bleeding cannot be completely stopped. Bleeding can be severe and often requires Raney clips to stop it.14,15 It seems that TXA is more suitable for patients with complex ZMC fractures.
However, the haemostatic effect of TXA on shorter preauricular incisions was not significant. We speculate that this was related to the low amount of bleeding from the preauricular incision. Its skin and subcutaneous layer do not have as many blood vessels, nor do they have numerous hair follicles.16 The main type of postoperative bleeding in the temporomandibular joint area is capillary bleeding. It seems to indicate that TXA may not form blood clots at the capillary level, meaning that TXA may not affect tissue oxygen supply and blood circulation. Of course, further basic and clinical research is needed.
Timing of TXA use
Our data show that in the ZMC fracture group, TXA had the most significant haemostatic effect on the first and second postoperative days. On the third day there was no significant difference. This interesting phenomenon may be related to the mechanism of wound healing. It has been reported that postoperative blood loss occurs most often within 48 hours of surgery.17 By the third postoperative day most bleeding sites had been stopped by the clotting mechanism.18 TXA seems to enhance the haemostatic effect when the body needs to stop bleeding, but it stops working at the end of the physiological haemostatic process. This suggests that the best time to use TXA is within two days of surgery.
Safety
No postoperative thrombosis was observed in any of the patients in our study, which is consistent with the findings of other researchers.3,19–21 It indicates that TXA does not increase the risk of thrombosis.
Conclusions
TXA can reduce postoperative bleeding in patients with ZMC fractures, and the optimal usage time is on the first and second postoperative days. For patients with mandibular condylar fractures TXA may not be used.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient’ permission
The study was conducted based on the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School and Hospital of Stomatology of Wuhan University (Approval number: 2023-B02). All patients were informed that their clinical data might be used for research and informed consents have been obtained.","Tranexamic acid (TXA), a synthetic lysine derivative that inhibits fibrinolysis, is widely used to reduce hemorrhage in trauma and surgery. However, its postoperative effects in maxillofacial fracture surgeries remain underexplored. This study examines the haemostatic efficacy and optimal timing of TXA administration in patients undergoing surgery for unilateral zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures and unilateral mandibular condylar fractures.

Clinical data were collected from patients treated at the School and Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University between September 2020 and August 2022. After applying strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, 44 patients with ZMC fractures and 46 with mandibular condylar fractures were enrolled. Patients were divided into TXA and control groups based on postoperative TXA use. TXA was administered at a dose of 0.5 g, given once or twice daily for varying durations.

Results showed that in ZMC fractures, the TXA group had significantly lower total blood loss (78.64 ml vs. 108.71 ml, p = 0.006) with marked reductions on the first and second postoperative days, while no difference was noted on the third day. In contrast, TXA did not significantly affect blood loss in mandibular condylar fractures, likely due to the limited bleeding from preauricular incisions. No adverse thrombotic events were reported. The study concludes that TXA effectively reduces postoperative hemorrhage in complex ZMC fractures when administered during the first two postoperative days, but offers limited benefit in mandibular condylar fracture surgery.

These findings guide targeted TXA use in maxillofacial surgery, highlighting its timing and context-specific advantages. The study offers valuable clinical insights.","This study investigates the postoperative haemostatic effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) in patients with maxillofacial fractures. Researchers analyzed data from 44 patients with unilateral zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures and 46 with unilateral mandibular condylar fractures, comparing TXA use to a control group. Patients were excluded for various reasons, including being minors, having bilateral fractures, or receiving other haemostatic drugs.

The study found that TXA significantly reduced postoperative blood loss in ZMC fracture patients, particularly on the first and second postoperative days, suggesting an optimal usage time. However, TXA did not significantly reduce blood loss in mandibular condylar fracture patients. The authors speculate this difference might be due to the surgical approach, with more significant bleeding associated with incisions used for ZMC fractures compared to those for condylar fractures. The study observed no instances of deep vein thrombosis, supporting the safety of TXA use in this context.","This study investigates the postoperative effects of tranexamic acid (TXA) on blood loss in patients with zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) and mandibular condylar fractures. TXA, an antifibrinolytic agent, was administered postoperatively to 20 ZMC fracture patients and 16 condylar fracture patients, with control groups receiving no TXA. Results showed that TXA significantly reduced total blood loss in ZMC fracture patients by approximately 30 ml (p=0.006), particularly on the first and second postoperative days (p=0.015 and p=0.021, respectively). However, no significant reduction in blood loss was observed in condylar fracture patients (p=0.917). The study suggests that TXA is most effective within the first two postoperative days, aligning with the peak period of postoperative bleeding. No cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or other complications were reported, indicating TXA's safety. The findings recommend TXA for ZMC fractures but not for mandibular condylar fractures, where bleeding is minimal. The study concludes that TXA is a safe and effective haemostatic agent for ZMC fractures when used within the first two postoperative days.",19,2.4,14.2,,,95,85,5,100,85,90,5,100,90,90,5,100

Laser therapy, with its ability to precisely target scar tissue, has garnered attention for its potential to address hypertrophic scars. The aim of our systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy of lasers in reducing post-surgical cleft lip scar. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Wiley library, Cochrane library databases for the studies published between 1 January 2003 and 1 October 2023. All studies were included in which a laser was used for scar reduction and had a minimum follow-up period of three months. For all study designs the appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools were used. Primary outcome was to measure reduction in scar using the Vancouver scar scale or total improvement in the scar. From this systematic review we can conclude that lasers have shown better results on post-surgical cleft lip scar. However, more comparative studies are needed with large sample sizes to assess the laser?s pure potential.","Introduction
Orofacial clefting (OFC) is a range of anomalies seen in newborns, primarily affecting structures around the mouth. It can extend to facial areas, leading to deformities in oral, facial, and craniofacial regions. The primary classification includes isolated cleft palate (CP) and cleft lip (CL), with or without involvement of the palate.1,2
According to a multicentre, hospital-based study involving 94,610 births, the incidence of CL/P was found to be 9.3 cases per 10,000 births, while the incidence of cleft palate stood at 1.7 cases per 10,000 births.3
Individuals born with cleft lip and palate face challenges in feeding, speaking, hearing, and social integration. These can be improved through surgeries, dental treatments, speech therapy, and psychosocial support. Corrective surgery for cleft lip is typically done within the first year of life, between three to six months. Management requires a multidisciplinary team and long-term monitoring.4–6
An optimal treatment approach should aim to re-establish regular occlusion and speech functionality, as well as improve facial aesthetics.7 Over the years, several techniques have been suggested (including those by Le Mesuirier in 1949, Tennison in 1952, Cronin in 1966, Millard in 1976, and Noordhoff in 1984) to treat cleft deformities.8,9
The incidence of hypertrophic scar formation following cleft lip repair is seldom reported, and the figures that do exist vary significantly, ranging from 8% to 47%, according to different authors. In a study by Soltani et al, hypertrophic scarring was observed in 25% of patients, while the remaining 75% showed normal wound healing.10 The development of hypertrophic scars (HTS) after cleft lip repair often requires surgical correction. Scar tissue can cause secondary irregularities such as philtrum deformation, Cupid's bow asymmetry, upper lip tightness, whistle deformity, and disruptions in the function of the orbicularis oris muscle. These scars typically develop from three to six months post-surgery due to abnormal wound healing, leading to excessive collagen buildup and inflammation. Normal skin is replaced by nonfunctional fibrous tissue, resulting in functional and cosmetic deformities.11–14
Cleft lip scar management options include surgical and non-surgical approaches. Non-surgical methods include silicone gel/cream, taping, scar massages, Botulinum toxin injections, and laser therapy. Some methods like silicone gel sheets, can pose challenges such as ingestion in infants.15–17
Lasers have been used for treating hypertrophic scars and keloids for 30 years. Various types of lasers are available depending on their wavelength and mechanism of action.18
This systematic review is done to answer the question: Is laser an effective treatment modality for reducing post-surgical cleft lip scar?
This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of laser treatments on post-surgical cleft lip scars.

Study selection
Two reviewers independently screened the data. Initial screening was based on title and abstract, with full-text articles obtained for studies lacking sufficient information. Upon obtaining full-text articles the studies were assessed for eligibility and any uncertainty regarding study eligibility was resolved through discussion between the reviewers. Ultimately, six studies suitable for inclusion in the systematic review were identified. Excluded studies were documented, along with reasons for exclusion. Authors were not blinded to journal titles, study authors, or institutions.
Data collection
After a thorough screening of the relevant studies, six full text articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. All the duplicates were removed. Data collection was done independently by reviewers and any incompatibilities were resolved through discussion between the reviewers. The data was then extracted into a standard tabular form using Microsoft Excel.
Data items
Data items included for extracting the data were: Author’s name/year, Study design, Sample size, Comparison group, Intervention group, Number of sessions, Outcomes measured and Study conclusion.
Risk of bias of individual studies

Results of individual studies
The included six studies were: one randomised controlled trial, three non-randomised controlled trials, one retrospective study, and one cross sectional study. Out of all the studies, two did not have any control group. The other four studies compared lasers with normal surgical repair, silica gel massage, or corticosteroid creams. The type of lasers that were used in the studies were low power diode laser, fractional CO2, and intense pulsed light with lattice CO2.
Mohsen et al.22 conducted a trial to assess the efficacy of low power diode lasers on cleft lip scars in 60 patients using the Vancouver scar scale and ultrasound. Significant scar reduction (p=0.008) occurred, with a reduction in thickness of the scar by day 14 and improvement appearance by day seven. Jahanbin et al in 2019 conducted a study23 to assess the effectiveness of fractional CO2 lasers in 12 cleft lip scar patients without a control group. The patients’ satisfaction was achieved along with scar quality improvement by 25%–50% and reduced upper lip muscle activity seen in electromyography. In a study by Peng et al.,24 25 cleft lip scar patients were treated by intense pulsed light and lattice CO2 in Group 1 while the Group 2 patients underwent conventional surgery followed by scar cream massage and silica gel products. Group 1 patients had shown significant scar reduction at three and six months postoperatively compared with Group 2 (p = 0.025, p = 0.002, respectively). A cross-sectional trial by Mossaad et al.25 included six cleft lip scar patients and assessed the effectiveness of fractional CO2 diode laser. There was significant scar reduction according to Vancouver scar scale and improved patient satisfaction. Shadad et al in 2021 conducted a non-randomised controlled trial26 on 120 cleft lip scar patients. Patients were divided into three groups; Group 1 received fractional CO2 therapy three weeks after surgery, Group 2 began fractional CO2 laser therapy three months after surgery and Group 3 used corticosteroid cream and silica gel for six months after surgery. Group 1 showed significant scar reduction and a high visual analogue scale score compared with Groups 2 and 3. Chi et al conducted a randomised controlled trial27 on 42 patients. These 42 patients were divided into three groups; Group 1 received fractional CO2 laser one month postoperatively, Group 2 received fractional CO2 laser three months postoperatively and group 3 received fractional CO2 six months postoperatively. The study showed significant scar reduction in Group 1 compared with Group 2 and 3, assessed one month post-therapy using the Vancouver scar scale.
Risk of bias in studies
Quality of the included studies were assessed individually by the reviewers by using JBI tool for critical appraisal for all the included studies (Table 3–6). Quality ranking was allocated as low (less than 33%), medium (33%–66%) or high (over 66%). Out of six studies, two studies were of medium quality while the other four studies were of high quality.

Discussion
Hypertrophic scarring typically develops within three to six months after the initial injury. Once formed, the scar may remain stable in size or begin to regress. In cleft lip patients, this regression can result in a shortened lip on the affected side. Hypertrophic scars remain localised to the original wound site, primarily increasing in size through growth in the perpendicular plane rather than lateral invasion. Aesthetic complication is a challenge to treat in cleft lip patients as facial expressions are vital for nonverbal communication, influencing how individuals convey emotions and thoughts. Achieving acceptable facial appearance and movements is crucial for their perceived self-worth. Cleft lip scar treatments aim to address both physical and psychological aspects to improve self-esteem and social confidence, ultimately enhancing overall well-being.28–31
Laser therapy has emerged as a promising modality for cleft lip scar reduction, offering distinct advantages when compared with other treatment options. Traditional methods for addressing cleft lip scars have included surgical interventions, topical treatments, and corticosteroid injections. Compared with surgical interventions, laser therapy generally involves less downtime, shorter recovery period and can be done under topical anaesthesia, which minimises risk of general anaesthesia. However, laser therapy presents a non-invasive and targeted approach with several notable benefits that include precise control over the depth of tissue penetration, enabling healthcare professionals to specifically target scar tissue without affecting surrounding healthy skin.32–34
Various lasers frequently employed for hypertrophic scars have been proven effective in addressing different aspects of these scars. Single or combination of these lasers have showed an effective result for improving the scars in patients.35
Laser types can be broadly categorised as ablative or nonablative. In the current review, studies by Jahanbin et al.,23 Mossaad et al.,25 Shadad et al.26 and Chi et al.27 used ablative lasers, such as a fractional CO2 laser in their studies, and had seen a significant reduction in the post-surgical cleft lip scar. A prominent treatment option for surgical and atrophic scars is fractional ablative laser resurfacing. Microscopic thermal treatment zones, or columns of thermal damage are divided from surrounding untreated skin in fractional ablative resurfacing. Since just a portion of the skin is affected, there is less downtime and a quicker rate of re-epithelialisation. Additionally, fractional lasers can penetrate the skin deeper than completely ablative lasers due to the microthermal therapy zones. CO2 lasers stimulate the wound's renewal processes and promote the growth of myofibroblasts and matrix proteins like hyaluronic acid.36
The study by Chi et al.27 also assessed the optimum time for laser therapy and they concluded that if therapy started at one month postoperatively there is a significant reduction in scarring.
Another ablative option for scar reduction is the erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Er:YAG) laser. It has two mechanisms; first is epidermal vaporisation, which necessitates skin resurfacing by the dermal appendages for the skin to recover. Second, heat damage to the dermis promotes the formation of collagen, which enhances the look of photodamaged skin and lessens the visibility of rhytids and scars. Moreover, the vaporising water serves as a heat sink, reducing the quantity of thermal injury to the surrounding tissues. Er: YAG lasers can pass over the same target area more than once during a single treatment session because of this cooling, which improves results while requiring fewer treatment sessions. In a case series Er: YAG was used on ten cleft patients, and it stated that the laser showed improvement in scar length, pliability and colour with less erythema.37
But due to the extended recovery time and associated risks, such as scarring, depigmentation, and infection, non-ablative lasers have been introduced. Non ablative lasers target specific elements like oxyhaemoglobin or melanin, following an exponentially decreasing absorption curve, with the highest absorption in the ultraviolet range.
In a clinical study, pulsed dye laser (PDL) was used along with fractional CO2 laser for treating moderate-severe cleft lip scars. They concluded that there was 50% in reduction of scar height, texture, pliability, and erythema. The mechanism of the PDL involves photo thermolysis of neovascularised tissue in hypertrophic scars, resulting in a decrease in inflammation, tissue hypoxia, and the stimulation of neocollagenesis.38,39
Recent studies have suggested that inadequate regulation of interleukin (IL)-6 signalling pathways and the expression of transforming growth factor beta-I (TGF-βI) play a significant role in this process. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) reduces IL-6 mRNA levels.40 In the study by Mohsen et al, low power diode laser 806nm was used on 60 cleft patients. The patients underwent 12 session of laser therapy, and it showed a significant improvement in the scar with respect to scar height, pliability, and vascularity.22
Intense pulsed light (IPL) devices are non-laser high intensity light sourceswhich have been used recently for scar reduction. The precise mechanism of action remains unknown. However, it can serve as a cost-effective alternative to therapies such as PDL and CO2 laser. In a study conducted in Turkey, 109 patients with hypertrophic scars underwent an average of eight sessions of IPL. Remarkably, over 90% of the patients showed significant improvement in height, erythema, and hardness.41,42 A retrospective study by Peng et al.24 used IPL and Lattice CO2 to treat cleft lip scarring and significant reduction in scar was seen during follow up after three and six months.
These lasers, which have been used for scar reduction on the cleft lip patients, have demonstrated better efficacy in enhancing the appearance of postoperative scars and can be recommended as an adjunctive treatment for patients seeking superior aesthetic outcomes. While surgical intervention typically results in an acceptable postoperative scar, hypertrophic scars often have a tendency to recur. Therefore, rather than opting for surgical scar revision, laser therapy can be considered. This treatment has minimal side effects and is unlikely to worsen the scar. Laser therapy can notably enhance aesthetics, particularly in patients prone to hypertrophic scarring.10 It is important to note that laser therapy may impose additional financial burdens on families due to expenses, multiple appointments, and extended treatment durations. However, the findings from these studies indicate promising results for achieving favourable aesthetic outcomes. Other minor complications associated with this are pain while the therapy is ongoing, crusting of the wound, and erythema.
The reviewed studies exhibited several limitations: Follow-up periods were inconsistent, outcome measurements varied, and one of the studies did not use a standard assessment scale. Additionally, inconsistencies were observed in the point of laser application, and optimal timing for therapy initiation was not consistently reported. A lack of randomised controlled trials was also seen. There is also a lack of evidence on the reaction of different skin types to the laser treatment.
The systematic review identifies several future implications. Firstly, further investigation into the unclear mechanisms of the action of lasers is necessary to improve understanding and refine treatment strategies for cleft lip scars. Secondly, there is a need for more randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the efficacy of laser treatments with other non-invasive methods. Thirdly, future research should prioritise the assessment of patient satisfaction as a crucial outcome measure. Lastly, consensus guidelines should be established regarding the optimal timing to initiate laser therapy and standardise follow-up protocols across studies. Also, numerous NGOs supporting cleft patient treatments across several countries could consider integrating this approach as an adjunctive method for managing postoperative scars. Doing so would elevate the quality of treatment, lead to improved outcomes, and potentially lower treatment expenses for patients.
Conclusion
From this systematic review we can state that lasers have shown a significant effect on scar reduction on cleft lip patients. It has also shown a decrease in muscle activity of the upper lip. Different lasers were used in the included studies, the most common of which was fractional CO2. According to this review we can conclude that early use of fractional CO2, such as one month postoperatively, has shown better results in scar reduction. It requires fewer sessions to show a satisfactory result, thus reducing time and the cost of the treatment. The study in which low power diode laser was used required 12 sessions (three sessions per week) to show a significant reduction in scarring. This will increase the cost and number of visits of the patients. Lastly, IPL the lattice CO2 was used in the study by Peng et al and treatment needed to be for six months postoperatively to show a significant result, which also increases treatment time and number of visits.

Orofacial clefting, which includes cleft lip (CL) and cleft palate (CP), affects newborns with an incidence of 9.3 cases per 10,000 births for CL/P and 1.7 per 10,000 births for CP. These congenital anomalies can impair feeding, speech, hearing, and social integration, necessitating a multidisciplinary treatment approach that typically involves early corrective surgery and long‐term follow-up.

The review aimed to answer whether laser treatments can effectively reduce hypertrophic scarring after cleft lip repair. Studies published between 2003 and 2023 were included if they used any laser modality and measured scar outcomes using the Vancouver scar scale or equivalent metrics, with a minimum follow-up of three months. A comprehensive literature search across databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Wiley Library, and Cochrane yielded six eligible studies involving a total of 310 patients. The designs ranged from randomized controlled trials to non-randomized trials, retrospective cohorts, and cross-sectional studies. Various lasers were employed, including low power diode, fractional CO₂, and intense pulsed light (IPL) lasers.

Results consistently showed significant improvements in scar appearance, thickness, and pliability. Notably, early postoperative laser intervention—particularly fractional CO₂ laser treatment initiated one month after surgery—proved most effective, reducing the number of sessions required and enhancing overall outcomes. Despite variations in follow-up duration and outcome measures among studies, the findings support laser therapy as a promising, minimally invasive adjunct to conventional cleft lip scar management, potentially lowering treatment costs and improving patient satisfaction.","This systematic review examines the effectiveness of laser treatments for post-surgical cleft lip scars. It analyzed six studies published between 2003 and 2023, comparing laser interventions (various types including fractional CO2, low-level diode laser, and IPL) to surgical repair alone, scar creams, or different timing of laser application. The review evaluated scar reduction using the Vancouver Scar Scale or overall scar improvement, alongside secondary outcomes like pain and scar appearance.

Results indicated that lasers, particularly fractional CO2 lasers applied early post-surgery (one month), showed significant scar reduction and improved patient satisfaction compared to control treatments. The included studies suggest laser therapy offers a less invasive and targeted approach with benefits like precise tissue penetration and quicker recovery. The review acknowledges limitations including study heterogeneity, inconsistent follow-up periods, and a lack of randomized controlled trials. Future research should focus on clarifying laser mechanisms, conducting more RCTs, prioritizing patient satisfaction, and establishing optimal treatment timing.","This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of laser therapy in reducing post-surgical cleft lip scars.

The aim of the present study was to analyse the improvement in dystonic contractions in patients with dystonia following the use of a Hegab temporomandibular joint splint (HTS). The Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Movement Scale (DMS) and Disability Scale were used in the current study to evaluate dystonia. An HTS with a thickness ranging from 4 to 6¬†mm was used to treat the patients enrolled in the study. The final sample comprised 14 patients (10 female and four male) with mean (range) ages of 35.64 (18 to 55) years. Pre-treatment DMS ranged from 6.5 to 57 mean (SD) 18.21 (13.38). At the end of the study, DMS ranged from 0 to 15 mean (SD) 3.14 (3.86). Statistical analysis of the differences between pre-treatment and post-treatment DMS showed a significant decrease in DMS at the end of the treatment period (p¬†=¬†0.0001).

There was a statistically highly significant decrease in the Disability Scale at the end of the treatment period (p value ‚â§ 0.0001). This study suggests that the HTS can be considered an effective treatment modality for dystonia, as it significantly decreases both the DMS and the Disability scale.","Introduction
Dystonia is a movement disorder characterised by involuntary and persistent severe muscle contractions that lead to rhythmic and atypical movements in various parts of the body. Based on the aetiopathogenesis, it can be categorised as focal, segmental, multifocal, or generalised. Based on the aetiology, dystonia can be categorised into primary dystonia (idiopathic or inherited) and secondary dystonia, which develops after traumatic or surgical incidents, brain diseases, or as a result of medications.1
Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is a focal dystonia of the oral cavity. It is a rare focal neurological disorder that affects the lower facial muscles and is characterised by repetitive or sustained involuntary prolonged spastic movements of the tongue, facial, and masticator muscles. OMD is classified into jaw-opening, jaw-closing, jaw deviation, lingual dystonia, or a combination of these.2,3
Meige’s syndrome is the combination of OMD, blepharospasm, and dystonic movements of the upper face.4 Tongue protrusion is usually a component of OMD or Meige’s syndrome. Other terms for OMD include orofaciomandibular dystonia, orofacial-buccal dystonia, lingual dystonia, jaw dystonia, cranial dystonia, and adult-onset facial dystonia.2–4
Clinical presentations vary based on the affected muscles as well as the severity and distribution of OMD.2 Dysfunctions include impaired mastication, dysphagia, dysphonia, unconscious opening and closing of the mandible, pulling and twisting of the mandible forward or laterally, and temporomandibular disorders (TMD) such as open locks.3,4
However, the mechanisms and causes of OMD are poorly understood. OMD may occur as a neurological disorder or secondary to certain drugs or disorders such as trauma or Wilson’s disease.2
Diagnosis of OMD is complicated because its clinical presentation is not uniform. The diagnosis is based on individual information, history, clinical examination, neurological examination, and confirmation through intramuscular electromyography.5
OMD treatment is multidisciplinary, and the efficacy of different treatment modalities has not been adequately evaluated.4 However, anticholinergic drugs, baclofen, benzodiazepines, anti-Parkinson drugs, and anticonvulsants are some of the agents used to manage OMD.
Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injections are considered a promising therapy for treating OMD.6 Swallowing difficulties, speech problems, and excessive muscle weakness have been reported in the treatment of lingual dystonia using BoNT.7 Deep brain stimulation surgery has been reported to be an effective and safe treatment.8
This prospective clinical study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the Hegab temporomandibular joint (TMJ) splint (HTS) in the treatment of dystonia.
Patients and methods
The study followed all tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human subjects and was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Al-Azhar University School of Dentistry. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled in the study.
Inclusion criteria
Patients between the ages of 18 and 70 years, who were referred to the clinic with complaints of bruxism and/or myofascial pain, jaw movement disorders, or TMD, were diagnosed with dystonia by a neurology specialist.
Exclusion criteria
For this study exclusion criteria included systemic diseases (the presence of polyarthritis or other rheumatic diseases), congenital anomalies, and previous treatment for dystonia (such as Botox).
This study was conducted at the Faculty of Dental Medicine, Al-Azhar University and Hegab Academy for Maxillofacial and TMJ Disorders from October 2018 to October 2022.
Sample size calculation
A power analysis was conducted using the statistical program G*Power version 3.1 by Franz Faul, based on previously conducted trial cases involving OMD. The input parameters were a power of 0.80, and an error probability of 0.05. The results indicated that a sample size of at least 12 participants was necessary.9
Clinical diagnosis of oromandibular dystonia
Blepharospasm; involuntary jaw opening and closing; jaw deviation; involuntary tongue movement; platysma muscle spasm; eating dysfunction; retraction of lips or lip pursing; cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis); limb dystonia (musician’s dystonia, writer’s cramp); and difficulty chewing, eating, and speaking, owing to the inability to control jaw movement, are the observed symptoms. Patients diagnosed with dystonia were referred to a neurologist for consultation and confirmation of the diagnosis.
Another psychological consultation was conducted with all patients enrolled in the study to confirm or exclude the presence of psychological disorders.
The Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Movement Scale (DMS) and Disability Scale10,11 were used in this study. A detailed description of the DMS is provided in Table 1.

Because of associated TMJ disorders, all patients enrolled in the study underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both TMJ. The MRI scans were obtained using a dental silicone latex mouth prop (bite-block rubber mouth opener). MRI images were evaluated for the presence or absence of disc displacement and osteoarthritis by a radiologist with more than 15 years of experience in MRI of TMJ disorders.12,13
The HTS13 was used to treat patients with all types of dystonia enrolled in this study. The HTS is a maxillary full-arch hard-stabilisation splint fabricated using a fluid resin. The splint was attached to the upper jaw using ball clasps without any extension of the acrylic resin on the buccal or labial surface of the upper jaw. The HTS has deep indentations on its occlusal surface to guide and hold the mandible at maximum intercuspation using bite registration records and study casts to prevent lateral dystonic movements. The selection of the vertical thickness of the occlusal splint depends on the MRI findings13 and the severity of dystonia. Based on the MRI measurements and clinical outcome records of Hegab et al,14 a 4 mm vertical splint thickness is recommended for disc displacement with reduction (DDR) and a 6 mm thickness is recommended for disc displacement without reduction (DDNR).
The dystonia movement and disability scales were recorded pre-treatment and at the end of the treatment period. The results were collected, tabulated, and statistically analysed. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Descriptive statistics and chi squared (χ2) tests were performed to compare the variables. Data were analysed using InStat statistical software (GraphPad Software Inc).
Results
During the study period, 450 patients were screened for eligibility. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as clinical and neurological evaluations, only 15 patients were diagnosed with dystonia. One patient with Meige syndrome was edentulous (and therefore unable to be treated with the HTS), treated with Botox injection, and excluded from our study (the patient had a history of haemorrhagic stroke).
The final sample comprised 14 patients (10 female and four male). Two patients were diagnosed with systemic dystonia, four with Meige syndrome, and eight with OMD. The patients’ ages ranged from 18 to 55 (mean 35.64) years.
The jaw-opening type of OMD was found in 5/14 patients, while 3/14 patients had the jaw-closing type. Additionally, 6/14 patients had a mixed form (both jaw closing and opening) of OMD, and lingual dystonia was present in 10/14 patients.
Two patients had multiple sclerosis; two were Khat addicts; two had obsessive-compulsive disorder and were undergoing medical treatment; seven had depression; and one had no significant comorbidities.
MRI evaluation showed that 10 patients had TMJ osteoarthritis; three, DDR; three, DDNR; one, unilateral dislocation; one, joint effusion; and four, disc degeneration. Conversely, three had normal MRI findings.
The treatment period ranged from three months to one year, and the follow-up period ranged from six months to two years. Table 2 presents the descriptive data of the patients enrolled in this study.

Pre-treatment DMS ranged from 6.5 to 57 mean (SD) 18.21 (13.38). At the end of the study, DMS ranged from 0 to 15 mean (SD) 3.14 (3.86). Statistical analysis of the differences between pre-treatment and post-treatment DMS showed a statistically significant decrease in DMS at the end of the treatment period (p = 0.0001).
Regarding the disability scale, pre-treatment disability scale ranged from 7 to 18 mean (SD) 9.46 (3.02), and at the end of the study, DMS ranged from 0 to 3 mean (SD) 1.46 (1.13). Statistical analysis of the differences between pre-treatment and post-treatment disability scales showed a statistically significant decrease at the end of the treatment period (p < 0.0001). Table 2 shows the statistical analysis of the differences between pre-treatment and post-treatment DMS and Disability Scale. Table 3 displays the statistical analysis of differences between pre-treatment and post-treatment DMS and Disability Scale. In the two patients diagnosed with systemic dystonia, the use of HTS resulted in immediate changes in posture, including body alignment, head shift, head tilt, and shoulder alignment. These changes were confirmed by the treating orthopaedic physician. The splint was used for six months to one year with follow-up periods ranging from nine to 18 months. The patients were administered clonazepam and gabapentin.

Discussion
In 1887, Horatio Wood, a United States neurologist, described involuntary facial and oromandibular movements, 23 years before French neurologist Henry Meige reported a series of patients exhibiting dystonic contractions of facial and neck muscles.15 The term ‘dystonia’ was coined in 1911 by Oppenheim, a German clinician.16 When no aetiology can be identified, the dystonia is referred to as primary dystonia. The term ‘dystonia plus’ is used when an associated neurological abnormality exists, such as parkinsonism and dementia.16
OMD is occasionally confused with other facialmovement disorders, such as hemifacial spasm, facial tics, myokymia, myorhythmia, hemimasticatory spasm, and aberrant regeneration with synkinesis after Bell’s palsy.17
Botulinum toxin injections provide the most effective relief from OMD, and early treatment with botulinum toxin may prevent dental and other complications, including TMJ syndrome and other oral and dental problems.18,19
In our study, we reported the case of an edentulous patient with a severe form of Meige syndrome who was treated with Botox injection owing to the inability to construct a splint because of missing dentition. The treatment was effective in reducing the DMS and Disability Scale scores.
Most cases of adult-onset dystonia are primary and ‘idiopathic’, with no specific cause, whereas secondary dystonia is caused by an underlying disease and may be inherited (a known genetic origin) or acquired. Acquired secondary dystonia include neurodegenerative disorders (such as Parkinson’s disease), traumatic diseases of the brainstem (such as stroke and multiple sclerosis), and side effects of drugs, particularly antipsychotic medications. In our study, two patients with dystonia had multiple sclerosis and one had haemorrhagic stroke.
De Meyer et al.20 performed a systematic review of the effects of oral and dental appliances on patients with OMD. Most reports are single-subject descriptions or small case series with considerable variability in the type of dystonia, type of appliance evaluated, and outcome measures. Although few patients with OMD, especially those who benefit from sensory tricks (manoeuvres, physical movements, or positions that can temporarily interrupt dystonia), may experience improvement with oral appliances, no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding which patients might benefit or the preferred type or mode of appliance. More recently, favourable effects of occlusal splints have been confirmed in patients with OMD, mainly in those with task-specific variants. The positive outcomes of oral appliances in these reports were attributed to the mimicking of a gestational antagonist. Based on the same hypothesis, Yoshida reported a 75% responder rate (improvement or resolution) using occlusal splints in 128 patients with OMD, noting a higher occurrence of beneficial sensory tricks among the responders.21,22
In our study, we used HTS with a vertical thickness ranging from 4 to 6 mm in the molar area, according to the severity of dystonia and the state of the associated TMJ disorders. In four of the patients enrolled in the current study, we modified the HTS design to guide the mandible into a correct relation to the maxilla. The HTS was effective, with a statistically significant improvement on the DMS and Disability Scale.
The limitations of the current study include the small sample size (owing to the rare occurrence of the disease) and the lack of a control group to compare different treatment modalities (because of the small sample size).
In the current study, patients with systemic dystonia showed immediate postural changes. The potential correlation between craniofacial morphology and spinal column posture remains a controversial issue in the scientific literature. TMD is a craniocervical mandibular disorder that can cause moderate postural instability even in patients with normal vestibular function. Indeed, head and neck posture may be considered indicators of the biomechanical equilibrium of the cranium and upper cervical spine, considering that TMD and cervical spine disorders share pathophysiological mechanisms. Furthermore, patients with cervical myofascial pain may present with an antalgic forward head posture to reduce pain by shortening the vertical extensor muscle, potentially developing trigger points in the cervical and masticatory muscles.23–25
Conclusion
Given the limitations of the current study, the HTS may be considered an effective treatment modality for dystonia. A detailed clinical examination with a neurological consultation is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of dystonia. The use of the HTS in patients with systemic dystonia can lead to immediate improvements in posture, including body alignment, head shift, head tilt, and shoulder alignment.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Al-Azhar University School of Dentistry. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled in the study.","This research project investigates the efficacy of the Hegab temporomandibular joint (TMJ) splint (HTS) as a treatment for dystonia, a movement disorder marked by involuntary, persistent muscle contractions causing abnormal movements. Focusing on oromandibular dystonia (OMD)—a rare focal dystonia affecting the oral cavity, including the jaw, tongue, and facial muscles—the study also considers conditions like Meige’s syndrome, which involves blepharospasm and dystonic upper facial movements. Diagnosis of OMD is challenging due to its varied presentation and is confirmed via clinical and neurological examinations and intramuscular electromyography.

Conducted at Al-Azhar University and Hegab Academy between October 2018 and October 2022, the prospective study screened 450 patients and enrolled 14 aged 18 to 70 years with systemic dystonia, Meige syndrome, or OMD. Patients underwent MRI evaluation of the TMJ to assess disc displacement and osteoarthritis. The HTS, a maxillary full-arch stabilization splint with deep occlusal indentations, was customized based on MRI findings and dystonia severity (4 mm thickness for disc displacement with reduction, 6 mm for without reduction).

Its effectiveness was measured using the Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Movement Scale and Disability Scale, revealing statistically significant improvements post-treatment. Pre-treatment scores on the Fahn-Marsden Scale averaged 18.21 while post-treatment scores dropped significantly to 3.14, confirming the splint’s effectiveness. Patients with systemic dystonia showed immediate postural corrections. Although limited by a small sample size and lack of a control group, the study highlights the HTS as a promising treatment for dystonia, with potential benefits in alleviating temporomandibular disorders and postural imbalances. Results confirm.","This study investigates the effectiveness of the Hegab Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Splint (HTS) in treating oromandibular dystonia (OMD), a rare neurological disorder causing involuntary muscle contractions in the face, jaw, and tongue. Fourteen patients diagnosed with dystonia, including OMD and Meige's syndrome, were fitted with HTS, with adjustments made based on MRI findings of associated TMJ disorders. The study measured dystonia severity and disability using the Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Movement Scale (DMS) and Disability Scale before and after treatment. Results showed a statistically significant decrease in both DMS and Disability Scale scores after HTS treatment (p < 0.0001), indicating an improvement in dystonia symptoms. The authors suggest HTS, particularly when modified to correct jaw alignment, can be a useful treatment for dystonia. They acknowledged study limitations included the small sample size and lack of a control group, but note the rare occurrence of the condition contributed to the small sample size.","This study evaluates the efficacy of the Hegab temporomandibular joint (TMJ) splint (HTS) in treating oromandibular dystonia (OMD) and related dystonic conditions. OMD, a rare neurological disorder, causes involuntary muscle contractions affecting the jaw, face, and tongue, leading to difficulties in chewing, speaking, and swallowing. The study included 14 patients (10 female, 4 male) aged 18–55, diagnosed with OMD, Meige’s syndrome, or systemic dystonia. The HTS, a maxillary occlusal splint with deep indentations to guide mandibular positioning, was used to manage dystonic movements. Treatment duration ranged from 3 months to 1 year, with follow-up periods of 6 months to 2 years. Results showed significant improvements in dystonia movement scale (DMS) and disability scale scores post-treatment (p < 0.0001). The HTS was particularly effective in reducing jaw deviations and improving posture in systemic dystonia cases. Modifications, such as lingual flanges, were added for severe OMD cases.

Electric scooter (e-scooter) rental trials were commenced in the United Kingdom in July 2020. In Oxfordshire, the trial began in February 2021 and is currently due to end in May 2026. These trials were commenced in response to the social distance movements and transport challenges that arose because of COVID-19. One of the principal reasons for the introduction of e-scooters is to provide more environmentally friendly forms of transport.1 The objectives of this trial were to support safe commuting to work, reducing the use of private cars and therefore congestion, reducing air pollution and carbon emissions and reviewing attitudes towards new mobility solutions.2
E-scooters are becoming increasingly popular and over 14.5 million rental e-scooter trips had been completed between July 2020 and December 2021 in 32 trials.3 E-scooters have many benefits as they provide the public with an accessible, relatively fast, easy to use, sustainable and low-cost form of transportation, allow easier access to key services and have mental health benefits.3 However, many safety concerns have been raised.
The Department for Transport evaluated the e-scooter trials from 2020 to early 2022 and reviewed safety around e-scooters. This demonstrated that 5% of e-scooter users had experienced a collision with 15% of these collisions resulting in attendance at Accident and Emergency (A&E). Additionally, the frequency of e-scooter collisions were higher than for pedal cycles in 2021 and the provisional estimated casualty rate was three times higher than for pedal cycles.3
Alongside safety concerns, approximately half of e-scooter users would have walked or cycled if they did not have access to an e-scooter; raising concerns that they reduce physical exercise and consequently negatively impact health.3
The aim of our study, which has been conducted following this report is to investigate oral and maxillofacial injuries associated with e-scooters within the trial period in Oxfordshire so as to gather data to inform on future policy regulation and legislation on e-scooters.
Material and Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted between October 2022 and September 2023 of all e-scooter related maxillofacial injuries which presented to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, a major trauma centre. Notes from the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) department were manually reviewed. These included trauma clinics, handover lists, inpatients, and the acute OMFS ambulatory unit. Additionally, Health Informatics conducted a search via the electronic database using the phrases ‘electric’, ‘e-scooter’ and ‘scooter’ to identify patients who had presented to A&E with an e-scooter related injury. This database was manually reviewed to identify patients with maxillofacial injuries.
The data collected included patient demographics (gender, age), mechanism, date and time of injury, the oral and maxillofacial-related injury and its associated management, whether the patient was under the influence of alcohol, and whether helmets were worn. Data collection, storage and statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. Formal ethical approval was not required as this was a retrospective cohort study.
Results
Forty-nine patients (mean [range] age 28 [13–48] years, 32 [65.3%] male) suffered a maxillofacial related injury from an e-scooter during the study period. Most injuries occurred in the summer season (32.7%, n = 16), followed by winter (28.6%, n = 14), autumn (24.5%, n = 12) and then spring (14.3%, n = 7) with the highest month for injuries being June, with seven injuries in this month.
Twenty patients (40.8%) were under the influence of alcohol at the time the injury occurred. No individual was recorded to have worn a helmet at the time of injury, eleven patients (22.4%) were recorded not to have worn a helmet at the time of injury and the remaining thirty-eight patients (77.6%) had no documentation indicating its use.
The mechanism of injury is shown in Table 1. The most common reason was a fall (85.7%, n = 42) and documentation suggested ten falls were secondary to external conditions including potholes, ice on road, or sudden swerving to avoid pedestrians or other vehicles. Twelve falls were due to rider errors such as hitting the pavement and losing control, however, it also included one patient who sustained their injury after they were thrown over the handlebars of the e-scooter after sudden braking. One injury was also the result of two users using one e-scooter. Seven (14.3%) accidents were the result of a collision with the majority of these being from a collision with a car (n = 6). There were no assaults whilst riding an e-scooter in our cohort.

Accidents occurred most during the evening (defined as the hours between 18:00 to midnight) and night (defined as the hours between midnight and 06:00) with fifteen and seventeen accidents, respectively. The proportion of patients who were under the influence of alcohol at the time the injury occurred was also reviewed. Twelve patients (70.6%) who had an accident at night were under the influence of alcohol at the time of injury, in comparison with 11.1%, 16.7% and 26.7% in the morning, afternoon and evening, respectively.
Maxillofacial injuries and their management are shown in Table 2. Ten patients (20.4%) suffered a facial fracture [two patients (4.1%) with fractures of the mandible, three patients (6.1%) with zygomatic-orbital fractures, one patient (2.1%) with a nasal fracture and four patients (8.2%) with multiple fractures involving sphenoid, zygomatic-orbital, frontal, nasal and maxillary bones]. Four (40%) of these facial fractures required surgical management. One patient sustained a unilateral temporomandibular joint dislocation although they self-discharged from A&E before receiving any treatment.

There were four patients with facial fractures who also sustained other significant associated injuries with high morbidity, which are shown in Table 3. This included a patient who sustained an orbital floor fracture with an associated inferior rectus entrapment, a patient with a left orbital and nasal fractures with a concurrent acute subarachnoid haemorrhage, a left frontal bone and zygomatic complex fractures with associated pneumocephalus, and a patient with multiple facial fractures who required intubation and ventilation in ITU due to a reduced GCS of 8 alongside a left sided retrobulbar haematoma.

Thirty-three (67.3%) patients sustained facial lacerations of which fourteen (42.4%) required surgical management for washout and wound closure (Table 2). The majority (ten patients, 71.4%) of these were performed under local anaesthetic. However, one patient had a significant facial laceration causing depressor labii inferioris weakness, which required surgical repair in theatre under general anaesthetic (GA). The remaining three patients who had surgical repair performed under GA were having an operation anyway which necessitated the GA and the facial wounds were closed concurrently.
There were nine (18.4%) dental-related injuries sustained, which included chipped, fractured, and mobile teeth (Table 2). Eight of these were referred to the general dentist practitioner and one patient received two extractions under GA as they were undergoing a concurrent open reduction and internal fixation for a mandibular fracture.
Discussion
There have only been a few UK studies conducted looking at maxillofacial injuries from e-scooters.4–8 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study performed to look at maxillofacial injuries occurring from the e-scooter trial in Oxfordshire. Our study demonstrates significant maxillofacial injuries that can occur from e-scooters, which is consistent with studies conducted worldwide.9–20
In our study, the mean age at injury was 28 years, with males being more frequently affected, comparable to contemporary literature.4–8 The average age could be because people are using e-scooters for commuting to work rather than for fun/play. The department for transport reviewed journey purpose and found that reasons for e-scooter use varied depending on frequency of use. Regular users were more likely to use them to commute whereas single use riders were more likely to have used them for fun.3 The user survey found that of users who rented e-scooters three to four times a week, 44% were for commuting and 5% for fun and in those who rented e-scooters only once ever, 4% of these were for commuting and 49% for fun.3
The highest number of injuries were in summer and may be secondary to higher numbers of e-scooter riders in warmer weather and more tourists, as Bentham et al have also suggested.21 Our study identified that some falls were secondary to weather conditions including slipping on ice, which may explain the high number of injuries in winter.
The highest number of injuries occurred during the evening and night and a lack of high visibility clothing worn by e-scooter riders may be a potential explanation. Alcohol may be a contributing factor as our study demonstrated a higher proportion of patients were under the influence of alcohol when the accident occurred at night (70.6%). Indeed Pakarinen et al identified reduction in the amount of hospital care related to e-scooter injuries when night-time usage was restricted with the primary aim of limiting the number of intoxicated riders.22 Current UK legislation regarding the e-scooter trial regulations state that e-scooters should only be used by one person at a time, there is a maximum speed limit of 15.5mph, users must be aged 16 or over, mobile phone use is prohibited, e-scooters can only be used on the road and in cycle lanes, drink driving offences apply and helmets are recommended but not a legal requirement.3 It remains against the law to use a privately owned e-scooter.23 However, our study identified several safety issues related to e-scooter rider errors and poor compliance with the government guidance.
Our findings demonstrated that 24.5% of users had accidents because of rider error. Additionally, sudden braking caused a patient to be thrown over their handlebars, which resulted in an orbital floor fracture with inferior rectus entrapment, a maxillofacial surgical emergency. Ahluwalia et al suggested that a speed reduction from 15.5 to 12.5 mph could result in 35% reduction in injurious kinetic energy and lead to increased reaction times and the likelihood of coming to a sudden stop, therefore reducing injuries.4 Education in riding e-scooters including rider technique, training and braking mechanisms could contribute to increasing the safety of e-scooters. Furthermore, e-scooter braking designs may need to be reviewed. Meanwhile, some falls and subsequent injuries were secondary to external factors such as potholes, demonstrating a potential need for local government to review and improve their road surfaces.
Poor compliance with the regulations is shown in our cohort as the youngest patient with a maxillofacial injury was 13 years old and one injury in our cohort was sustained as a result of two users riding one e-scooter.2,23
A total of 40.8% of our patients were under the influence of alcohol at the time the injury occurred. Other studies have also demonstrated an association between being under the influence of alcohol and sustaining an e-scooter-related injury.11,24,25 This highlights a significant safety concern and further poor compliance with the regulations. This emphasises the need for heightened public awareness about this law and the associated dangers of drink driving, and review of the enforcement of this. E-scooter riders can be prosecuted under drink or drug driving laws, therefore, we support legislation which exists for police to breathalyse riders as to their intoxication status and recommend testing for other drug substances that can also affect e-scooter safety.
No individual was recorded to have worn a helmet at the time of injury in our study population. This is consistent with other studies in the UK, which have consistently demonstrated low helmet usage in e-scooter related injuries, ranging from 0% to 8.3%.4–6,8 It has been demonstrated that helmets in bicycle-related injuries can reduce the rate of craniofacial injuries including facial fractures and soft-tissue injuries, although the amount of protection varies with facial location of injury.26,27 Mitchell et al have also identified helmets to be associated with reduced risk of head injury in e-scooter presentations.28 Increased helmet usage may therefore prevent some maxillofacial injuries or reduce their severity. The low helmet usage may be related to the legislation that only recommends but does not mandate a helmet, provision of helmets or a reduced awareness amongst e-scooter users about the dangers of injuries and benefits helmets can provide. Indeed, surveys have demonstrated that 71% of the general public feel that it should be a legal requirement to wear helmets when riding e-scooters.29 Newcastle and York are included in the e-scooter trials provide helmets with all rental e-scooters, and larger proportions of these users wear helmets (36% - 58%) compared to other trial areas (22%).3 Additionally, some trials have initiated long-term e-scooter leases that include a helmet.3 We would suggest that our data can be used to inform government to prompt discussions that target increased helmet provision and usage, raised awareness of the benefits of helmets and considerations to making helmet usage a legal requirement for e-scooter users.
A literature review has demonstrated the significant psychological trauma which can occur from orofacial trauma.30 This includes increased levels of post-traumatic stress disorder, distress, anxiety, and depression.30 Initial assessment of patients with orofacial trauma could include psychological screening tools to allow early recognition of psychological issues and subsequent intervention. This can lead to more holistic care of patients and improved prognosis.
One of the limitations of this study are that it was a retrospective study, and therefore documentation was limited to what was recorded at the time, meaning that some information was not known or recorded, including data on helmets. Considering and documenting helmet use when taking a trauma history should be highlighted as a teaching point from this study from an OMFS perspective. There is also a limitation in determining the exact effect of alcohol on the injuries sustained, and no information to analyse on blood alcohol concentration levels. It was not recorded in the patient notes whether any injuries were from private e-scooters as opposed to rental; however, the injury sustained was the same regardless of the source of the e-scooter and so would not affect the safety recommendations. There is a limitation in determining how vigorously the e-scooter rules and regulations are being enforced as data regarding the number of penalty notices issued to e-scooter riders or to people with privately owned e-scooters from Oxfordshire police during the study period was not available. Additionally, whilst you are required to scan your driving license to unlock an e-scooter, there is a lack of information regarding whether checks were performed in our study group as to the lawfully-defined possession of a driving license.2 Although the data are from a single-centre, we believe that these findings contribute to data from other UK cities. In the longer term, multi-centre studies are needed to review e-scooter related injuries, their severity, and associated risk factors.
Conclusions
Maxillofacial injuries can occur from e-scooter injuries and are significant. Our study highlights several safety concerns in particular surrounding poor compliance with UK laws and helmet usage. The Oxfordshire trial is due to end in May 2026 and our results can inform and influence future legislation. Our study emphasises the need to improve safety through raising public awareness and education about the laws and risks of e-scooters to increase compliance, focussing on sobriety, enforcement of e-scooter laws, and helmet usage. Considerations should be given to speed limits, safety and visibility clothing, e-scooter lights, e-scooter training, and whether helmets should be mandatory.

Initiated in response to COVID-19 challenges and as an environmentally friendly transport alternative, the e-scooter trial began in February 2021 and is set to conclude in May 2026. The study retrospectively reviewed records from the John Radcliffe Hospital (a major trauma centre) between October 2022 and September 2023, focusing on injuries documented by the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) department and A&E database searches.

A total of 49 patients (mean age 28 years, 65.3% male) sustained maxillofacial injuries. The majority (85.7%) of incidents resulted from falls, with contributory factors including rider error, adverse external conditions, and collisions with vehicles (14.3%). Injuries predominantly occurred during evening and night hours, with a marked association with alcohol consumption; 40.8% of patients were intoxicated at the time of injury. Notably, helmet usage was absent or poorly documented in all cases. Injury types ranged from facial lacerations (67.3%), many requiring surgical intervention, to facial fractures (20.4%), with some cases presenting severe complications such as orbital fractures, pneumocephalus, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The study underscores significant safety concerns in e-scooter usage, including non-compliance with legal guidelines, poor protective measures, and the role of alcohol. It advocates for enhanced public education, stricter enforcement of regulations, and possible policy changes such as mandatory helmet use, reduced speed limits, and improved infrastructure to mitigate risks and inform future legislation. Overall, findings support urgent policy reform.","Introduction
Electric scooter (e-scooter) rental trials were commenced in the United Kingdom in July 2020. In Oxfordshire, the trial began in February 2021 and is currently due to end in May 2026. These trials were commenced in response to the social distance movements and transport challenges that arose because of COVID-19. One of the principal reasons for the introduction of e-scooters is to provide more environmentally friendly forms of transport.1 The objectives of this trial were to support safe commuting to work, reducing the use of private cars and therefore congestion, reducing air pollution and carbon emissions and reviewing attitudes towards new mobility solutions.2
E-scooters are becoming increasingly popular and over 14.5 million rental e-scooter trips had been completed between July 2020 and December 2021 in 32 trials.3 E-scooters have many benefits as they provide the public with an accessible, relatively fast, easy to use, sustainable and low-cost form of transportation, allow easier access to key services and have mental health benefits.3 However, many safety concerns have been raised.
The Department for Transport evaluated the e-scooter trials from 2020 to early 2022 and reviewed safety around e-scooters. This demonstrated that 5% of e-scooter users had experienced a collision with 15% of these collisions resulting in attendance at Accident and Emergency (A&E). Additionally, the frequency of e-scooter collisions were higher than for pedal cycles in 2021 and the provisional estimated casualty rate was three times higher than for pedal cycles.3
Alongside safety concerns, approximately half of e-scooter users would have walked or cycled if they did not have access to an e-scooter; raising concerns that they reduce physical exercise and consequently negatively impact health.3
The aim of our study, which has been conducted following this report is to investigate oral and maxillofacial injuries associated with e-scooters within the trial period in Oxfordshire so as to gather data to inform on future policy regulation and legislation on e-scooters.
Material and Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted between October 2022 and September 2023 of all e-scooter related maxillofacial injuries which presented to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, a major trauma centre. Notes from the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) department were manually reviewed. These included trauma clinics, handover lists, inpatients, and the acute OMFS ambulatory unit. Additionally, Health Informatics conducted a search via the electronic database using the phrases ‘electric’, ‘e-scooter’ and ‘scooter’ to identify patients who had presented to A&E with an e-scooter related injury. This database was manually reviewed to identify patients with maxillofacial injuries.
The data collected included patient demographics (gender, age), mechanism, date and time of injury, the oral and maxillofacial-related injury and its associated management, whether the patient was under the influence of alcohol, and whether helmets were worn. Data collection, storage and statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. Formal ethical approval was not required as this was a retrospective cohort study.
Results
Forty-nine patients (mean [range] age 28 [13–48] years, 32 [65.3%] male) suffered a maxillofacial related injury from an e-scooter during the study period. Most injuries occurred in the summer season (32.7%, n = 16), followed by winter (28.6%, n = 14), autumn (24.5%, n = 12) and then spring (14.3%, n = 7) with the highest month for injuries being June, with seven injuries in this month.
Twenty patients (40.8%) were under the influence of alcohol at the time the injury occurred. No individual was recorded to have worn a helmet at the time of injury, eleven patients (22.4%) were recorded not to have worn a helmet at the time of injury and the remaining thirty-eight patients (77.6%) had no documentation indicating its use.
The mechanism of injury is shown in Table 1. The most common reason was a fall (85.7%, n = 42) and documentation suggested ten falls were secondary to external conditions including potholes, ice on road, or sudden swerving to avoid pedestrians or other vehicles. Twelve falls were due to rider errors such as hitting the pavement and losing control, however, it also included one patient who sustained their injury after they were thrown over the handlebars of the e-scooter after sudden braking. One injury was also the result of two users using one e-scooter. Seven (14.3%) accidents were the result of a collision with the majority of these being from a collision with a car (n = 6). There were no assaults whilst riding an e-scooter in our cohort.

Accidents occurred most during the evening (defined as the hours between 18:00 to midnight) and night (defined as the hours between midnight and 06:00) with fifteen and seventeen accidents, respectively. The proportion of patients who were under the influence of alcohol at the time the injury occurred was also reviewed. Twelve patients (70.6%) who had an accident at night were under the influence of alcohol at the time of injury, in comparison with 11.1%, 16.7% and 26.7% in the morning, afternoon and evening, respectively.
Maxillofacial injuries and their management are shown in Table 2. Ten patients (20.4%) suffered a facial fracture [two patients (4.1%) with fractures of the mandible, three patients (6.1%) with zygomatic-orbital fractures, one patient (2.1%) with a nasal fracture and four patients (8.2%) with multiple fractures involving sphenoid, zygomatic-orbital, frontal, nasal and maxillary bones]. Four (40%) of these facial fractures required surgical management. One patient sustained a unilateral temporomandibular joint dislocation although they self-discharged from A&E before receiving any treatment.

The highest number of injuries were in summer and may be secondary to higher numbers of e-scooter riders in warmer weather and more tourists, as Bentham et al have also suggested.21 Our study identified that some falls were secondary to weather conditions including slipping on ice, which may explain the high number of injuries in winter.
The highest number of injuries occurred during the evening and night and a lack of high visibility clothing worn by e-scooter riders may be a potential explanation. Alcohol may be a contributing factor as our study demonstrated a higher proportion of patients were under the influence of alcohol when the accident occurred at night (70.6%). Indeed Pakarinen et al identified reduction in the amount of hospital care related to e-scooter injuries when night-time usage was restricted with the primary aim of limiting the number of intoxicated riders.22 Current UK legislation regarding the e-scooter trial regulations state that e-scooters should only be used by one person at a time, there is a maximum speed limit of 15.5mph, users must be aged 16 or over, mobile phone use is prohibited, e-scooters can only be used on the road and in cycle lanes, drink driving offences apply and helmets are recommended but not a legal requirement.3 It remains against the law to use a privately owned e-scooter.23 However, our study identified several safety issues related to e-scooter rider errors and poor compliance with the government guidance.
Our findings demonstrated that 24.5% of users had accidents because of rider error. Additionally, sudden braking caused a patient to be thrown over their handlebars, which resulted in an orbital floor fracture with inferior rectus entrapment, a maxillofacial surgical emergency. Ahluwalia et al suggested that a speed reduction from 15.5 to 12.5 mph could result in 35% reduction in injurious kinetic energy and lead to increased reaction times and the likelihood of coming to a sudden stop, therefore reducing injuries.4 Education in riding e-scooters including rider technique, training and braking mechanisms could contribute to increasing the safety of e-scooters. Furthermore, e-scooter braking designs may need to be reviewed. Meanwhile, some falls and subsequent injuries were secondary to external factors such as potholes, demonstrating a potential need for local government to review and improve their road surfaces.
Poor compliance with the regulations is shown in our cohort as the youngest patient with a maxillofacial injury was 13 years old and one injury in our cohort was sustained as a result of two users riding one e-scooter.2,23
A total of 40.8% of our patients were under the influence of alcohol at the time the injury occurred. Other studies have also demonstrated an association between being under the influence of alcohol and sustaining an e-scooter-related injury.11,24,25 This highlights a significant safety concern and further poor compliance with the regulations. This emphasises the need for heightened public awareness about this law and the associated dangers of drink driving, and review of the enforcement of this. E-scooter riders can be prosecuted under drink or drug driving laws, therefore, we support legislation which exists for police to breathalyse riders as to their intoxication status and recommend testing for other drug substances that can also affect e-scooter safety.
No individual was recorded to have worn a helmet at the time of injury in our study population. This is consistent with other studies in the UK, which have consistently demonstrated low helmet usage in e-scooter related injuries, ranging from 0% to 8.3%.4–6,8 It has been demonstrated that helmets in bicycle-related injuries can reduce the rate of craniofacial injuries including facial fractures and soft-tissue injuries, although the amount of protection varies with facial location of injury.26,27 Mitchell et al have also identified helmets to be associated with reduced risk of head injury in e-scooter presentations.28 Increased helmet usage may therefore prevent some maxillofacial injuries or reduce their severity. The low helmet usage may be related to the legislation that only recommends but does not mandate a helmet, provision of helmets or a reduced awareness amongst e-scooter users about the dangers of injuries and benefits helmets can provide. Indeed, surveys have demonstrated that 71% of the general public feel that it should be a legal requirement to wear helmets when riding e-scooters.29 Newcastle and York are included in the e-scooter trials provide helmets with all rental e-scooters, and larger proportions of these users wear helmets (36% - 58%) compared to other trial areas (22%).3 Additionally, some trials have initiated long-term e-scooter leases that include a helmet.3 We would suggest that our data can be used to inform government to prompt discussions that target increased helmet provision and usage, raised awareness of the benefits of helmets and considerations to making helmet usage a legal requirement for e-scooter users.
A literature review has demonstrated the significant psychological trauma which can occur from orofacial trauma.30 This includes increased levels of post-traumatic stress disorder, distress, anxiety, and depression.30 Initial assessment of patients with orofacial trauma could include psychological screening tools to allow early recognition of psychological issues and subsequent intervention. This can lead to more holistic care of patients and improved prognosis.
One of the limitations of this study are that it was a retrospective study, and therefore documentation was limited to what was recorded at the time, meaning that some information was not known or recorded, including data on helmets. Considering and documenting helmet use when taking a trauma history should be highlighted as a teaching point from this study from an OMFS perspective. There is also a limitation in determining the exact effect of alcohol on the injuries sustained, and no information to analyse on blood alcohol concentration levels. It was not recorded in the patient notes whether any injuries were from private e-scooters as opposed to rental; however, the injury sustained was the same regardless of the source of the e-scooter and so would not affect the safety recommendations. There is a limitation in determining how vigorously the e-scooter rules and regulations are being enforced as data regarding the number of penalty notices issued to e-scooter riders or to people with privately owned e-scooters from Oxfordshire police during the study period was not available. Additionally, whilst you are required to scan your driving license to unlock an e-scooter, there is a lack of information regarding whether checks were performed in our study group as to the lawfully-defined possession of a driving license.2 Although the data are from a single-centre, we believe that these findings contribute to data from other UK cities. In the longer term, multi-centre studies are needed to review e-scooter related injuries, their severity, and associated risk factors.
Conclusions
Maxillofacial injuries can occur from e-scooter injuries and are significant. Our study highlights several safety concerns in particular surrounding poor compliance with UK laws and helmet usage. The Oxfordshire trial is due to end in May 2026 and our results can inform and influence future legislation. Our study emphasises the need to improve safety through raising public awareness and education about the laws and risks of e-scooters to increase compliance, focussing on sobriety, enforcement of e-scooter laws, and helmet usage. Considerations should be given to speed limits, safety and visibility clothing, e-scooter lights, e-scooter training, and whether helmets should be mandatory.

Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a chronic premalignant disease characterised by progressive scarring of the oral mucosa, predominantly affecting Asians who chew areca nut or smokless tobacco (SLTs). OSMF causes burning of the oral mucosa and reduced mouth opening, and has a substantial malignant transformation risk of 1.9%–9%.1–4
The pathogenesis of OSMF is not fully elucidated, but the chewing of areca nut is an established aetiological factor.5,6 Arecoline, the major areca nut alkaloid, stimulates fibroblasts to increase collagen production, a hallmark of OSMF.7 However, recent evidence suggests a relatively low prevalence of OSMF among areca nut chewers, and tobacco appears to have more than just an additive effect when used with areca nut.8,9 Further, the sporadic incidence of OSMF among areca nut or tobacco users indicates that other contributing cofactors are likely to be involved in its pathogenesis.10 Potential aetiological cofactors proposed are capsaicin in chili consumption, micronutrient deficiencies, genetic predisposition, and epigenetic changes. 5,11,12
We recently reported an additional role of dietary factors13 and coincidentally observed that OSMF patients (Fig. 1) often hail from high-fluoride regions.This led us to consider that fluoride may also be a contributing factor in OSMF. Fluoride originates from fluorine gas and occurs in soil, rocks, water, and food items, especially tea.14 It accumulates readily in calcified tissues such as bone and teeth on ingestion. Chronic, excessive, systemic, and topical exposure causes dental and skeletal fluorosis.15 Fluoride may elicit oxidative stress, even at low doses, by inhibiting antioxidant enzymes, depolarising mitochondria, and generating reactive oxygen species.16,17 It can also provoke inflammation by activating NF-kB and increasing cytokines such as IL-8, COX-2, and nitric oxide.18,19 Limited evidence suggests that fluoride impacts fibroblast viability and disrupts collagen maturation.20,21

Fig. 1 Typical oral submucous fibrosis patient with pre-existing fluorosis from region with increased fluoride in drinking water.
Regionally contaminated drinking water is the major source of fluoride14 Yadav et al22 showed that fluoride levels were high in pan masala (16.5–306.5 μg/g) and gutkha (28–113 μg/g), and found increased leaching of fluoride from these products under acidic conditions similar to those in the stomach.22 However, comprehensive data are lacking on the fluoride content of areca nut, tobacco, and their commercial preparations, which are commonly chewed in India.
Gutkha and pan masala consumption is rising among the young despite legislation curtailing access.23 Unrestricted availability from street vendors facilitates access among children and teenagers.24 Vigilance is inadequate and enforcement lacking.23,24 Those initiated on these addictive, inexpensive products become habitual users, hoarding pouches despite knowledge of the health risks.25 The habitual use of smokeless tobacco perpetuates dependence, enhances toxicity, and chronically exposes the oral tissues to harmful constituents.25 Our study therefore aimed to assess fluoride levels in various forms of commercially available areca nut and smokeless tobacco products.
Material and methods
This pilot study was conducted in the Kalyana Karnataka region, India, with prior ethics approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee (Ref No. HKDET/EIC/16-10--21/120/21).
We aimed to assess fluoride levels and gathered various samples for analysis. Areca nut and smokeless tobacco products, including their ingredients, were procured from Kalaburagi, Karnataka, India. Unprocessed ripe areca nut and raw areca nut samples, along with soil and water samples from the same field in Shivamogga, Karnataka, were collected by one of the authors (GA).
A total of 70 processed areca nut samples (10 from each of the 7 varieties: Baradi, Pooja, Chali, Dudhia, Chikani, Battalu, Assam) were obtained from Kalaburagiareca market (Fig. 2). Sweet betel nut packets (5 each) with different additives and flavours were procured based on their popularity.

Fig. 2 Areca nut varieties (A: Baradi; B: Pooja; C: Chali; D: Dudhia; E: Chikani; F: Battalu; G: Assam).
For fluoride analysis, 40 samples of pan masala (5 from each of the 8 varieties) were selected, including a mixture of areca nut with slaked lime, catechu, and flavouring agents, but without tobacco. We also chose five varieties of pan masala that were commonly used to prepare self-made gutkha. To create gutkha, we combined these pan masalapackets with the respective twin packets of tobacco (Fig. 3). Five packets of gutkha were prepared for fluoride analysis. The tobacco samples were Tota and Chaini, which are sun-dried or fermented, coarsely cut tobacco leaves. We obtained five samples each of Tota and Chaini tobacco.

Fig. 3 Image depicting preparation of gutkha using twin packets of pan masala and corresponding tobacco sachet.
We also procured catechu and slaked lime (Fig. 4), both ingredients commonly used in pan masala. We obtained five samples each, 10 g/sample of catechu and slaked lime from local shops in Kalaburagi that supply to pan masala manufacturers.

From Shivamogga (Teerthahalli), India, we collected 10 samples of unprocessed raw areca nuts (Fig. 5). We also acquired soil and water samples from the areca nut cultivation area in Shivamogga.

Fluoride levels were measured using alkali fusion and the fluoride ion selective electrode method26 at the State Level Water Testing Laboratory (Government), Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. For this, 0.5 g of dried, powdered sample was taken in a nickel crucible and covered with 5 ml of 8M sodium hydroxide solution. It was evaporated to dryness and placed in a muffle furnace heated to 525 °C for three hours. After cooling to room temperature, 15 ml of distilled water was added and the sample solution neutralised to pH 7.5 using dilute hydrochloric acid. The neutralised sample was transferred to a 50 ml plastic volumetric flask and diluted to volume with distilled water. Using a fluoride ion selective electrode meter, 5 ml aliquots were analysed for fluoride. Fluoride concentration was expressed in mg/kg.
The fluoride levels of all the components of the smokeless tobacco products, soil, and water samples were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post hoc Dunn's test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 20.0 (IBM Corp).
Results
The results of the study showed the presence of high fluoride concentrations in all components of the smokeless tobacco products analysed (Fig. 6). The Kruskal-Wallis H test showed a statistically significant difference in the level of fluoride between the different tobacco products (χ2(9) = 68.3760, p < 0.001) with a mean rank fluoride level of 62.35 for gutkha, 54.62 for pan masala, 18.0 for unprocessed areca nut, 21.86 for areca nut, 20.80 for sweet betal nut supari, 87.70 for tobacco, 91.10 for lime, 105.0 for catechu, 44.0 for soil, and 2.0 for water.

Post hoc tests using Dunn's method revealed that the pairwise comparison between water and tobacco (p = 0.001), water and lime (p = 0.004), water and catechu (p < 0.001), unprocessed areca nut and tobacco (p = 0.001), unprocessed areca nut and lime (p = 0.005), unprocessed areca nut and catechu (p < 0.001), sweet betal nut supari and gutkha (p = 0.021), sweet betal nut supari and tobacco (p < 0.001), sweet betal nut supari and lime (p = 0.002), sweet betal nut supari and catechu (p < 0.001), areca nut and tobacco (p = 0.001), areca nut and lime (p = 0.007), areca nut and catechu (p < 0.001), and pan masala and catechu (p = 0.032) groups showed significant differences. The significance values were adjusted by the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests.
The mean (SD) fluoride concentration in gutkha was 10.87 (4.54) mg/kg. For pan masala, it was 9.81 (3.23) mg/kg. Unprocessed areca nuts had a lower mean fluoride concentration of 5.63 (0) mg/kg than processed areca nuts (5.90 (1.05) mg/kg). The two varieties of sweet betel nut (sweet supari) showed a mean of 5.95 (1.40) mg/kg fluoride.
Among the tobacco products, the mean (SD) fluoride concentration was 22.15 (14.46) mg/kg. There was considerable difference between the two tobacco brands tested. The mean for Tota was 11.92 mg/kg while for Khaini it was 32.38 mg/kg, a wide variation. For slaked lime, the mean fluoride concentration was 16.67 (0) mg/kg. Catechu had the highest mean concentration of all the products tested at 51.20 (0) mg/kg.
There were considerable differences between the seven areca nut varieties tested. The Kruskal-Wallis H test revealed a statistically significant difference in the level of fluoride among areca nut products (χ2(6) = 43.5, p < 0.001), with the highest mean rank fluoride level for Pooja 50.10 (6.9 mg/kg) and Battalu, 50.30 (6.7 mg/kg), followed by Baradi 40.80 (6.2 mg/kg).
The soil sample from the areca nut cultivation area contained a mean (SD) of 7.96 (0) mg/kg fluoride. However, the water sample had a normal fluoride level of 0.86 (0) mg/kg.
Overall, the highest mean fluoride content was found in catechu, followed by tobacco, then gutkha and pan masala, areca nut products, and soil. Although fluoride was present in soil, the water source had normal levels.
Discussion
The findings of this pilot study shed light on the previously under-explored relation between fluoride and smokeless tobacco products, and provide a clue regarding the potential risk of developing oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF). The study primarily focused on the assessment of fluoride levels in various commercially available areca nut and smokeless tobacco (SLT) products, including gutkha, pan masala, and other components of smokeless tobacco products.
The results showed high fluoride concentrations across all components of smokeless tobacco products and unprocessed areca nuts, as well as in soil samples (Fig. 6). Significant variation (as shown by the Kruskal-Wallis test and post hoc Dunn's test) existed between products, with catechu (mean 51.20 mg/kg), tobacco (mean 22.15 mg/kg), slaked lime (mean 16.67 mg/kg), and gutkha (mean, 10.87 mg/kg) having the highest fluoride content, followed by pan masala (mean 10.87 mg/kg). In contrast, sweet betel nut/sweet supari (mean 5.95 mg/kg), areca nut (mean 5.90 mg/kg), and unprocessed raw areca nut (mean 5.63 mg/kg) had relatively comparable fluoride levels, despite some minor differences. This finding is particularly concerning since catechu, tobacco, and areca nut, are integral components of several smokeless tobacco products widely consumed in certain regions. The estimated fluoride intake from habitual use could surpass safety limits.27 These findings show that smokeless tobacco products are a significant source of fluoride exposure.
One noteworthy aspect of the study was analysis of the fluoride content in processed areca nuts and raw areca nuts harvested directly from trees. While fluoride was detected in both, the raw nuts showed relatively lower levels than processed nuts. This highlights the potential impact of processing techniques in increasing fluoride concentrations in commercially available areca products. The insight may be valuable for future studies that investigate specific factors that contribute to the accumulation of fluoride in these products.
The inclusion of soil and water samples from the areca nut cultivation area offers an additional context. The presence of fluoride in the soil highlights the potential for areca nut plants to accumulate fluoride from the environment, which may significantly contribute to the fluoride content in the final products.28 In contrast, the normal fluoride level in the water source suggests that the soil has a major influence on the concentration in areca nuts. This underscores the necessity of further research to elucidate the determinants implicated in the accrual of fluoride within the nuts.
The findings highlight two key aspects regarding fluoride in smokeless tobacco products.
First, the remarkably high fluoride content in commercial products such as gutkha and pan masala indicates substantial exposure from their regular use, especially given increased oral absorption. Yadav et al.22 demonstrated a 20-fold increase in fluoride release from pan masala and gutkha in acidic conditions when compared with a neutral pH, indicating greater exposure to oral tissues during chewing. The absorption studies demonstrated that fluoride is readily taken up by oral tissues when continuously exposed locally.29,30 As a result, the oral mucosa accumulates fluoride over time, becoming a reservoir for it.29 This suggests that regular gutkha users may absorb considerable amounts of fluoride, as the oral tissues may serve as a reservoir, absorbing and retaining it from these products.
Studies have also found that fluoride elicits oxidative stress and inflammation, even at low doses, by inhibiting antioxidant enzymes, depolarising mitochondria, and activating NF-kB.16–18 It can impact collagen synthesis and maturation.20,21 We propose that these mechanisms may initiate a pro-fibrotic state in the oral mucosa on chronic fluoride exposure, alongside areca nut chewing, leading to pathogenesis of OSMF.
Secondly, estimates of total dietary intake overlook fluoride that comes from other forms of tobacco and areca nut. Fluoride contributions, however, may be considerable depending on the levels in the product and frequency of use.22 Intake could suffice or synergise with contaminated water to exceed the optimal safe range. For susceptible individuals, this might exacerbate the severity of OSMF or hamper recovery after tobacco cessation.
With widespread smokeless tobacco use in India, especially among lower socioeconomic groups,1,4,13,23,24 fluoride exposure from these sources is likely to be substantial but under-recognised. Fluoride-OSMF associations merit greater attention given the impact of fluoride on oral mucosal health and its role in OSMF and malignant transformation. Elucidating its impact underscores the need to limit topical exposure from tobacco and curb the risk of OSMF. Overall, further investigation is needed to confirm whether the fluoride content of smokeless tobacco contributes to the occurrence of OSMF.
This study, however, has limitations. The small, uneven samples and lack of standardised sampling precluded rigorous statistical analysis. Findings should be interpreted cautiously as a preliminary investigation. The intake estimates also relied on assumed levels of use rather than on quantification of the products consumed and fluoride released during chewing. Further research with larger, systematic samples is required to conclusively ascertain the levels of fluoride exposure from commercial areca nut and tobacco items.
Conclusion
This pilot study provides initial evidence that popular smokeless tobaccos contain substantial amounts of fluoride. Unregulated use may therefore contribute to fluoride intake beyond safety thresholds. Given increasing consumption, the implementation and enforcement of a stricter gutkha and pan masala ban is warranted to protect youth. Public health programmes should highlight fluoride as an additional toxic compound in these products, and healthcare professionals should account for fluoride from oral tobacco when assessing risks. Consumers should minimise usage and opt for safer, permitted alternatives. The findings warrant future comprehensive research to establish epidemiological links between fluoride exposure from these products and the occurrence or severity of OSMF.

Traditionally linked to areca nut chewing, which induces fibroblast-mediated collagen overproduction via the alkaloid arecoline, OSMF’s inconsistent occurrence among users suggests additional contributing cofactors.

The researchers explored fluoride levels in several components of commercially available smokeless tobacco (SLT) products, including gutkha, pan masala, processed and unprocessed areca nuts, sweet betel nut (supari), tobacco, catechu, and slaked lime. Samples were also obtained from soil and water in areca nut cultivation areas in India. Fluoride quantification was performed using an alkali fusion method with a fluoride ion selective electrode. Findings revealed marked differences in fluoride content across products: catechu registered the highest concentration (mean 51.20 mg/kg), followed by tobacco (22.15 mg/kg), slaked lime (16.67 mg/kg), gutkha (10.87 mg/kg), and pan masala (9.81 mg/kg). Unprocessed areca nuts exhibited lower fluoride levels than processed ones, implicating processing methods in fluoride accumulation. Although soil contained moderate fluoride, water levels remained normal.

The study concludes that the substantial fluoride exposure from these SLT products, combined with areca nut chewing, might synergistically provoke oxidative stress and inflammation—mechanisms central to collagen dysregulation and OSMF pathogenesis. Despite limitations such as small, uneven sample sizes, these preliminary results warrant stricter regulation of SLT products and further comprehensive research into fluoride’s contributory role in OSMF.","This research paper investigates the potential role of fluoride in the pathogenesis of Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSMF), a premalignant condition prevalent among areca nut and smokeless tobacco (SLT) users.

The results reveal high fluoride concentrations in catechu, tobacco, gutkha, and pan masala, significantly exceeding levels in unprocessed areca nuts and local water sources. This suggests that SLT products contribute significantly to fluoride exposure, potentially exacerbating OSMF risk. The study highlights that the high fluoride content is concerning due to increased oral absorption and the potential for fluoride to induce oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially leading to a pro-fibrotic state in the oral mucosa alongside areca nut chewing.

Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) encompass a range of diseases involving muscular dysfunctions and the temporomandibular joint. These disorders have a complex origin, are influenced by various factors,1 and may result in discomfort, clicking, crepitus, and restricted mandibular motions.2 Limitations in mandibular mobility, discomfort associated with mandibular function, and joint noises may all be indicative of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems (internal derangement).3
TMJ arthrocentesis enables the elimination of synovial fluid with inflammatory mediators and adhesion, which reduces discomfort and improves joint function. Many TMJ arthrocentesis materials have been outlined previously for managing TMJ internal derangement. Lactated Ringer’s solution, regular saline, and ozonised water were among these constituents.4,5
The second-generation blood concentrate, referred to as platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), possesses a strong three-dimensional fibrin matrix and can be used in a single centrifugation step without the need for anticoagulation or an activator. It should also have significant advantages over first-generation platelet concentrates in regenerative medicine. Injectable PRF offers numerous advantages, as it fosters angiogenesis and accelerates the healing process.6,7 The objective of this study was to assess a therapy regimen for the treatment of symptomatic internal derangement of the TMJ. The proposed treatment involved arthrocentesis with an anterior repositioning splint (ARS), either as a sole intervention or in combination with injectable PRF.
Patients and methods

These patients had TMJ pain, restricted maximum mouth opening, and no improvement with conservative treatment, while also being free of MRI contraindications.
Exclusion criteria
The study excluded patients with contraindicated systemic diseases, mouth restriction from muscle spasms, neurological issues, fractures, cancers, complete edentulism, and congenital and developmental TMJ disorders.
Patient grouping
In this study, patients were randomly allocated into two groups:
Group I: Patients who received treatment involving ARS and arthrocentesis only.
Group II: Patients who received treatment involving ARS, arthrocentesis, and an injectable PRF (I-PRF) injection.
Sample size calculation
A power analysis was conducted using the statistical program G*Power version 3.1 by Faul et al, based on previously conducted trial cases involving maximum mouth opening (MMO).8 An a priori analysis was carried out to determine the necessary sample size power, and effect size. The input parameters were a power of 0.80, a number of groups of two, and an error probability of 0.05. The results showed that a sample size of at least n = 60 samples, with 30 samples for each group, was necessary.
Operative procedures
-        
Construction of modified ARS:
Casts were made from alginate impressions and an interocclusal bite registration was obtained using a protrusive interocclusal record, then transferred to the articulator. A custom-made 5 mm thick hard acrylic anterior repositioning appliance with full maxillary teeth coverage was secured with Adam's clasps on the upper first molars to ensure proper fitting and retention.
-        
Application of modified ARS:
Following the arthrocentesis procedure, the appliance was worn according to the following schedule over a six-month period: patients were initially instructed to wear the appliance for just two hours on the first day of the first week. Subsequently, they were advised to incrementally extend the duration by two hours each day until they were wearing it for a total of 14 hours daily by the conclusion of the first week. In the second week, the appliance was to be worn continuously for 14 hours every day. Patients were told to gradually extend the time they spent wearing the appliance each day starting in the third week, increasing it to 24 hours per day (excluding mealtimes), and to continue wearing it until the end of the sixth month. The ramp of the modified ARS was taken out during the seventh week. After that during the follow-up visits, the acrylic appliance was ground by 1mm every four weeks to prevent malocclusion until the thickness reached 3mm guided by articulating paper.
-        
Arthrocentesis
After anaesthesia was administered to the auriculotemporal, posterior deep temporal, and masseter nerves, the designated area was prepped by isolating it with sterile drapes and cleansing it with betadine. Entry sites were demarcated according to Nitzan et al’s9 protocol. An 18-gauge needle was carefully inserted at the initial marked point, and 2-3ml of Ringer's lactate solution was injected to enlarge the joint space. Subsequently, the second entry point was punctured with another 18-gauge needle to facilitate an unobstructed flow of the solution through the joint area. In total, 100–200cc of the solution was employed for lavaging the upper joint space. In order to liberate the disc and release its fibrous tissue, the lower jaw was moved in the protrusive, vertical, and lateral orientations (Fig. 1).

Postoperative care
On the day of surgery, patients were instructed to use cold packs for 15 minutes every hour to reduce postoperative oedema. The following day, awarm compresswas applied similarly. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), an anti-oedematous drug, and a muscle relaxant were administered to all patients. Furthermore, patients were advised to follow a soft diet to reduce joint pressure and perform daily exercises, which included active and passive stretching exercises for the masticatory muscles. It was recommended to complete each exercise three times a day for a duration of six weeks.
Postoperative evaluation
•        
Clinical evaluation
Postoperatively, the patients underwent evaluations at one week, one month, three months, and six months. Maximum mouth opening was determined by measuring the distance between the incisal edges of the upper and lower incisors, and lateral movements right and left were also measured. Pain was measured with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), 10 cm line.
•        
MRI evaluation
MRI scans were taken at six months postoperatively to assess alterations in the disc's position during both opening and closing movements.
Statistical analysis
For the purpose of descriptive statistics, data were gathered, reviewed, and examined. MANOVA and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyse the time of investigations (T0, T1, T2, T3). A 0.05 level independent samples t-test was used. Data analysis was carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). (IBM-SPSS ver. 28.0 for Mac OS).

Maximum mouth opening (MMO)
Initial MMO differences between groups were not significant, but both groups showed a significant mean (SD) MMO increase from 26.67(5.47) mm preoperatively, to the sixth month postoperatively 43.11(2.08) mm with a 61.65% increase from preoperatively. Inter-group MMO differences at first, third, and sixth months postoperatively were highly significant (Table 1).

MRI was used for the evaluation of the TMJ disc of our cases in both groups. Preoperatively, all patients had a disc displacement without reduction. After six months of follow up, regarding the anteroposterior disc position, the MRI images indicated that in both groups the disc did not return to its typical anatomical and physiological alignment with the condyle and articular eminence. Regarding the condylar position, all MRI images showed that there was a change of condylar position in comparison to the preoperative MRI images in mouth opening (Fig. 3).

Discussion
The objective of this study was to assess a therapy regimen for the management of symptomatic internal TMJ dysfunction. The recommended regimen of therapy involved either arthrocentesis and ARS alone or the incorporation of I-PRF after arthrocentesis. In this study, ARS was used in the treatment of DDwoR in our patients, and this agrees with the conclusion of Guo et al.11 In the current study, the ARS was adjusted to a 5mm thickness at the posterior teeth, following the approach described in Hegab et al’s TMJ stabilising appliance. This modification aimed to address the clinical signs and symptoms associated with disc displacement without reduction, which had previously shown improvement in Hegab et al’s study.12
The patients in this study were instructed to wear a modified ARS splint for six weeks. Transition from part-time modified ARS use to a stabilising appliance was implemented to address potential issues.11,13–16
Injectable PRF was administered into the upper joint space after the arthrocentesis procedure, which showed improvement in the joint symptoms. This was corroborated by the findings of other investigations.7,16–19 Injectable PRF promotes cartilage regeneration more effectively than PRP due to its longer-lasting release of greater amounts of growth factors. Injectable PRF has been employed to regenerate tissues in diverse therapeutic applications. It is becoming a helpful addition to encourage healing in a variety of dental and oral therapeutic operations, such as bone regeneration in grafts and fractures and periodontal regeneration in dental implants.20–22 The study was consistent with the research of Torul et al18 and Karadayi et al,19 both of whom observed positive outcomes when combining arthrocentesis with a single I-PRF injection in terms of postoperative comfort and maximum mouth opening.
In the present study, MMO in group I was significantly increased from preoperatively to the sixth month postoperatively with a 61.65% increase from preoperative values. MMO in group II was significantly increased from preoperatively to sixth months’ postoperatively with an 85.5% increase from preoperative measurements. So, the difference between groups I and II after one, three, and six months is highly significant for group II. These findings align with the research conducted by Yuce et al7 and Torul et al.18
The pain was measured by VAS. Group I significantly decreased from preoperative values to sixth months’ postoperatively with a −77.45% decrease. In Group II there was a significant decrease from preoperative values to the sixth month postoperatively with a −92.7% decrease. The difference between Groups I and II regarding TMJ pain at three and six months postoperatively exhibited substantial significance, particularly for group II. These results are in accordance with the outcomes documented by Yuce et al.7 Their findings indicated that the study group that received I-PRF had a significantly greater maximum interincisal opening and experienced less pain. Similarly, Hanc et al20 reported results that align with these findings, indicating that intra-articular PRP injection was more effective than arthrocentesis alone. I-PRF, as noted by Torul et al,18 contains an abundance of leukocytes, platelets, growth factors, and cytokines within its liquid matrix, which may be a contributing factor to its seemingly prolonged favourable outcomes in the treatment of TMJ internal derangement.
The therapeutic benefits of I-PRF were highlighted in the research, which was attributed to its hydraulic adhesiolysis. This process assists in reducing negative pressure in the upper joint space, restoring viscosity of synovial fluid, and improving intracapsular circulation through the prolonged release of growth factors. The effectiveness of I-PRF may also be associated with its anti-inflammatory properties.21 The research outcomes were in contrast to the findings of Albilia et al,16 who observed an insignificant reduction in pain score in 31% of their cases treated with only repeated I-PRF injections after 12 months, as well as an insignificant increase in maximum mouth opening for all cases, which may have been caused by the removal of the arthrocentesis and appliance in their study. An accelerated rate of articular cartilage regeneration at both the fourth and twelfth weeks following the surgical procedure was reported by El Rouf et al.21
In the current investigation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) served as the principal modality for soft tissue evaluation, recognised as the pre-eminent and gold standard method in this context. Nonetheless, it is imperative to acknowledge its inherent limitations, notably the absence of standardisation.22 Postoperative MRI was performed for each participant in the current investigation, revealing a consistent lack of changes in both experimental groups. The disc did not revert to its usual physiological alignment with the condyle and articular eminence in the anteroposterior disc position. Over time, the retrodiscal tissue also became less pliable and more fibrous, rendering it impractical to reposition the displaced disc along the condyle, whether in an open or closed mouth position. The previously injured retrodiscal tissue had the time to repair during the course of the therapy, forming a fibrous band that served as a pseudo disc and looked less tense than the remainder of the retrodiscal tissue.23–25

All patients signed the informed consent and permission forms.","This prospective, randomized controlled trial investigated the effectiveness of two treatment regimens for symptomatic internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in adult patients with bilateral disc displacement without reduction (DDwoR) confirmed by MRI. Thirty patients (sixty joints) were enrolled from an outpatient oral and maxillofacial clinic at Al-Azhar University, Assiut branch, over one year. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: Group I received TMJ arthrocentesis combined with an anterior repositioning splint (ARS), while Group II received the same regimen with the addition of an intra-articular injection of injectable platelet-rich fibrin (I-PRF).

Arthrocentesis was performed using an 18-gauge needle and lavage with Ringer’s lactate solution to remove inflammatory mediators and adhesions. The ARS, a custom-made 5 mm thick hard acrylic appliance, was used to reposition the mandible gradually, with progressive wear instructions over six months. For Group II, I-PRF was prepared by centrifuging patient blood and injected into the superior joint space following lavage.

Outcome measures included maximum mouth opening (MMO), lateral excursions, pain evaluation via a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and MRI assessments of disc and condylar positions. Results demonstrated significant improvements in both groups, with Group II exhibiting superior gains in MMO and greater pain reduction compared to Group I. MRI findings confirmed changes in condylar positioning, although the disc did not return to its normal anatomical alignment. These results support further research and wider clinical use.","This study investigated the effectiveness of arthrocentesis with an anterior repositioning splint (ARS) alone versus arthrocentesis with ARS and injectable platelet-rich fibrin (I-PRF) for treating temporomandibular joint (TMJ) internal derangement with disc displacement without reduction (DDwoR). Thirty patients with bilateral DDwoR were randomized into two groups: ARS and arthrocentesis (Group I) or ARS, arthrocentesis, and I-PRF injection (Group II). ARS was worn for six months, gradually transitioning from part-time to full-time use and then adjusted to prevent malocclusion. Clinical evaluations (mouth opening, lateral excursion, pain) and MRI scans were performed at baseline and post-operatively.

Both groups showed significant improvements in mouth opening, lateral excursion, and pain reduction over six months. However, Group II (with I-PRF) exhibited significantly greater increases in mouth opening and reduced pain compared to Group I at the three- and six-month follow-ups. MRI results showed no disc repositioning in either group, but condylar position changes were observed. The study suggests that while arthrocentesis and ARS are beneficial, adding I-PRF provides significantly better clinical outcomes for symptomatic TMJ internal derangement, potentially due to its regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties.","This research paper evaluates the efficacy of a combined treatment approach for symptomatic internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), comparing arthrocentesis with an anterior repositioning splint (ARS) to the same treatment augmented with injectable platelet-rich fibrin (I-PRF). TMJ disorders, characterized by pain, restricted jaw movement, and joint noises, often result from disc displacement without reduction (DDwoR). The study involved 30 patients (60 affected joints) randomly divided into two groups: Group I received ARS and arthrocentesis, while Group II received ARS, arthrocentesis, and I-PRF injection.",13,3.4,21.7,,,90,90,10,95,85,85,10,95,75,75,15,90

Patients were randomly allocated to the three treatment groups: Group 1 - twelve children in whom the nasal layers of the alveolar clefts were repaired using autologous platelet-rich fibrin with autogenous chin bone; Group 2 - twelve children in whom the nasal layers of the alveolar clefts were repaired using bovine collagen membrane type I (Colla-D) with autogenous chin bone; and Group 3 - twelve children in whom the bony alveolar clefts were grafted with autogenous chin bone after construction of a watertight nasal floor had been completed. The study population comprised 36 patients with alveolar clefts, ranging in age from seven to 12 years. At the last follow-up period all groups had stable healing conditions and good radiological outcomes in terms of the alveolar bone height bordering the teeth (both mesially and distally) and the incorporation of grafting material with the surrounding bone. The use of either a PRF membrane and a collagen membrane as an interpositional layer between the nasal layer and the autogenous chin bone graft enhanced bone formation and density in alveolar clefts compared with the control group.","Introduction
The child born with a cleft lip and palate (CLP) may have successful soft tissue closure of the lip and palate, but despite this initial cleft repair, complete rehabilitation of the maxilla, alveolar ridge, base of the nose, intraoral soft tissues, and dentition will still demand extensive skeletal and soft tissue reconstruction.1–3
Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a second-generation platelet concentrate that has the benefits of platelet activation, improved wound repair, and enhanced bone growth by slowly releasing growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), and fibrin-rich gel can be used for guided bone regeneration.4,5
Recently, the use of a resorbable collagen membrane as an interpositional barrier has been used as an adjunct to repair fistulas on the premise that it can aid in wound closure and has been widely described in the literature to guide the regeneration of bone and soft tissue.6,7
This prospective randomised clinical study aimed to compare the efficiency of using autologous platelet-rich fibrin versus a resorbable collagen membrane in secondary alveolar bone grafting.
Material and methods
The main inclusion criteria in this prospective study were patients with alveolar clefts, with their permanent canines either not at all or only partially erupted. Patients with systemic disorders that could potentially impair the grafting success and healing process, such as juvenile diabetes mellitus, were excluded from the study.
Informed consents were obtained according to the guidelines of human research adopted by the Research Ethics Committee (#R-OS-9-22-1) faculty of dentistry, Tanta university, and registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov (Registration ID: NCT05988086)
Patients were randomly allocated to the three treatment groups: Group 1 consisted of twelve children in whom the nasal layers of the alveolar clefts were repaired using autologous platelet rich fibrin with autogenous chin bone; Group 2 comprised twelve children in whom the nasal layers of the alveolar clefts were repaired using bovine collagen membrane type I (Colla-D) with autogenous chin bone; and in Group 3, there were twelve children in whom bony alveolar clefts were grafted with autogenous chin bone after the construction of a watertight nasal floor was completed.
Preoperative clinical evaluation of alveolar cleft site
This was considering the stability of maxillary segments, asymmetry of the alar base, and the presence of an oronasal fistula.
Preoperative radiographic evaluation of alveolar cleft site
Panoramic radiographs and axial computed tomographic (CT) scans were done for each patient and examined with regard to: size of cleft side, presence of supernumerary teeth, and stage of eruption of permanent canine and lateral incisor.
The surgical technique for closure of the cleft site
All surgical operations were performed using general anaesthesia and nasal endotracheal intubation. The cleft site was approached first to prepare the graft bed prior to bone harvest by creation of labial mucogingival flap on either side of the alveolar cleft. The lesser segment labial flap was started from just distal to the first molar tooth where it was angled up into the sulcus and then continued anteriorly through the gingival sulci until the cleft site, the incision continued superiorly along the mesial side of the cleft, and then through the rim of mucosa, further separating the oral and nasal fistula.8,9
The incision was continued for elevation of the contralateral (greater segment) labial flap through the gingival sulci of both central incisors, the submucosal dissection was performed using scissors directed superiorly to the oronasal fistula, separating the muscle and connective tissue from the nasal mucosa as it extended into the base of the upper lip, and the nasal mucosa was reflected from the palatal side of the cleft walls.
A palatal incision was then made around the teeth starting posteriorly at each first molar until the fistula site was approached at the alveolar cleft; the nasal mucosa was then separated at its point of attachment to the palatal mucosa. The nasal mucosa was then entirely detached from the oral mucosa of both the labial and palatal flaps, as well as the alveolar ridge and hard palate, and swept back into the floor of the nose; the nasal mucosa wound edges were then freshened and sutured to achieve closure with 4-0 Vicryl (polyglactin 910) suture material on a small cutting needle. To accomplish a watertight palatal closure, the elevated palatal flap was freshened along the prior fistular path and sutured with 3-0 Vicryl suture.
The surgical technique for bone graft harvest (donor site)
A vestibular incision was performed on the alveolar mucosa between the second premolar areas. The mandibular symphysis was broadly exposed up to the lower border of the mandible. A 5 mm safety margin below the apices and 3-5 mm thickness of the lower border was respected, the osteotomy of monocortical chin bone graft was performed using fine monobeveled chisel, the incision was closed using 3-0 Vicryl suture.10
Resorbable collagen membranes (MedPark Colla-D (MedPark Co, Ltd.) are manufactured from xenogeneic sources to manage oral wounds such as extraction sockets, sinus-lift procedures and for periodontal or endodontic surgeries. They act as scaffolds for bone deposition in guided bone regeneration to promote platelet aggregation, stabilise clots, attract fibroblasts, and facilitate wound healing. They are designed to resorb within two to 32 weeks and are biocompatible, easy to manipulate, and only weakly immunogenic.11
Preparation of the platelet-rich fibrin
A total of 20 ml of fresh venous blood was drawn from the patient, and each 10 ml of blood was placed in clean glass tubes. The two tubes were placed in a centrifuge set to 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, after which the tubes were removed from the centrifuge, which is made up of three layers: platelet-poor plasma in the upper zone, PRF in the middle zone, and red blood cells in the lower zone. The PRF was then separated and prepared for use.9
In all three groups we utilised the nasal mucosa to reconstruct the nasal floor. PRF and collagen sheets were used interpositionally between the nasal mucosal closure and the grafted bones. The PRF membrane was inserted under the nasal layer for Group 1 patients and bovine collagen membrane type I (Colla-D) was inserted under the nasal layer for Group 2 patients, and for Group 3 patients the nasal mucosa was sutured to achieve watertight closure with 4-0 Vicryl suture, then the palatine bone and base of the nose were filled with a cancellous bone graft, and the gingival mucoperiosteal flaps were repositioned in its place to cover the cleft area. Finally, the the oral flaps were sutured primarily using 3-0 Vicryl suture. (Figs. 1, 2)

Postoperative evaluation of the grafted site
The grafted site was evaluated clinically for healing condition at the follow-up periods (first and second week then first, third, sixth, and ninth month postoperatively); regarding the presence of flap dehiscence, infection, graft loss, and recurrence of oronasal fistula.
Radiological evaluation was done for each patient using axial computed tomography (CT) at the third and ninth month postoperatively to assess and measure local bone mineral density.
Statistical methods
Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences(SPSS version26), the chi squared test was used to compare between categorical variables and repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare numerical variables (level of the significance was set as p < 0.05).

During the first weeks of the follow-up period, mild inflammation was observed in three cases in Group 1, two cases in Group 2, and four cases in Group 3, necessitating the continuation of mouth wash and oral hygiene measures. Local tenderness of the grafted sites was evident in all cases, and no other signs of infection, flap dehiscence, graft loss, or recurrence of oronasal fistula could be detected.
At the first month, mild infection developed in one patient each in Group 1 and Group 2 with partial flap dehiscence but without sequestration of the graft, while in Group 3 mild infection developed in two patients with partial flap dehiscence and partial sequestration of graft.
At the ninth month, all patients had stable healing conditions, and the infection completely subsided from the previous complicated cases except for one patient in both Group 1 and Group 2 with partial loss of the graft bulk which didn't affect the ridge contour or recurrence of oronasal fistula. In Group 3, however, total graft loss was seen in two patients with deficient alveolar ridges at the cleft with recurrence of oronasal fistula. There were no statistically significant differences between the three groups at the different observation periods (p value > 0.05)
Radiographic results
In general, all three groups had good postoperative radiological outcomes in terms of alveolar bone height bordering the teeth mesially and distally, as well as the incorporation of the graft material with the surrounding bone. The bone density measurements of the grafted locations at various follow-up times for all groups illustrated in (Table 2). During the entire follow-up period, there was a substantial statistical difference between all groups in terms of graft density in comparison to that of the natural surrounding bone (Figs. 3, 4).

Discussion
The principles of surgical repair of unilateral alveolar cleft include accurate and tight closure of the nasal floor mucosa to seal the communication between the nasal cavity and the oral cavity, filling the alveolar cleft with grafted bone, and approximation of the oral mucosa on the labial and palatal aspects to achieve a watertight closure over the grafted bone.12
Secondary alveolar bone grafting, performed between the ages of nine and 12, has been regarded as the gold standard for alveolar cleft reconstruction. However, in this research, we adopted the procedure described by Precious 13 who reported that the optimum time to perform alveolar bone grafting is during mixed dentition and before the eruption of the maxillary canines. This is because many studies have shown that both graft incorporation and bone support for the unerupted teeth attained had optimal results when grafting was scheduled at this stage. 14–16
Multifactorial aspects affect the outcome of the graft; the most significant ones include the surgeon’s expertise, the periodontal health of the surrounding graft tissues, the timing of the procedure, and orthodontic treatment of the cleft area both before and after the graft. Although post-graft orthodontic treatment allows for the graft to mature and remodel, the graft is mostly provided by the eruption of the canine tooth adjacently, so pre-graft orthodontics may provide for improved surgical access for graft implantation and soft tissue closure.17,18
Regarding the orthodontic strategies for alveolar bone grafting in patients with clefts, enough time should pass following the procedure to permit healing of the soft tissues and bony integration. In this study, orthodontic therapy starts four to six months after bone grafting, or when radiographic data indicate that the bone quality is adequate.19–21
The main cause of failure in alveolar bone grafting is contamination of the graft after exposure in the nasal cavity; therefore, alveolar bone grafting should be delayed until stable soft tissue covering is achieved. Nonetheless, in our experience, both PRF membrane and collagen membrane can preserve the grafted area even when adequate closure is not possible, which is consistent with the findings of Craven et al and Coots et al. 14,15
Platelet-rich fibrin with chin bone grafting was used in Group 1 to improve the osteogenesis of the autogenous chin bone graft, which demonstrated significant improvement in osteogenesis nine months after surgery and helped to achieve adequate nasal layer closure as a double layer closure. This finding contradicts the findings of Schmitz et al 22 who questioned the effectiveness of using PRF.
A resorbable collagen membrane (Colla-D) was inserted in Group 2 to reinforce the rebuilt nasal lining. Resorbable collagen membranes act as an occlusive barrier against soft tissue regeneration and invasion and are commonly used to maintain graft material in its position, minimise graft resorption.23 Collagen membrane also has low immunogenicity, a strong haemostatic ability, a chemotactic impact on regenerative cells including fibroblasts and osteoblasts, and good dimensional stability.24–26
Cases of this study with incidence of flap dehiscence and graft infection were treated properly with continuation of mouth wash and improved at late follow up after three and six months postoperatively. This result agreed with Marukawa et al and Lavagen et al27,28 who reported that PRF inhibits bacterial growth due to three factors: first, it concentrates white blood cell counts and platelets to cause bacterial inhibition by a greater number of functionally variable leukocytes; secondly, PRF has acidic PH (6.5–6.7); and thirdly, PRF causes rapid development of granulation tissue by enhancing capillary ingrowth bringing in circulating macrophages and neutrophils.
In this research, adding membranes to a chin bone graft was the only way to restore integrity of the bone in the cleft area, but in other clinical studies, xenograft and collagen barrier membranes were used in conjunction with mandibular bone block graft. The authors concluded that wrapping a mandibular bone block transplant in graft material and covering it with a collagen membrane could prevent graft resorption during healing. If the bone graft degrades in the absence of a membrane, palatal/nasal mucosal tissue might infiltrate, leading to the formation of an oronasal fistula. To protect the bone transplant during remodelling and absorption into the cleft, the membrane must surround the entire bone graft. 29,30
Conclusion
The use of a PRF membrane and a collagen membrane as an interpositional layer between the nasal layer and the autogenous chin bone graft improved bone formation and density in alveolar clefts compared with the control group. They also acted as a physical barrier when these membranes were placed, covering the suture line of the nasal and palatal mucosa. However, there was no significant difference in terms of complications, but there was a significant difference in terms of bone density at nine months’ follow up.

Although initial soft tissue closure of cleft lip and palate may be achieved through conventional repair, complete rehabilitation—including reconstruction of the maxilla, alveolar ridge, nasal base, intraoral soft tissues, and dentition—often requires additional skeletal and soft tissue reconstruction. PRF, a second-generation platelet concentrate, promotes improved wound repair and bone growth by gradually releasing growth factors such as PDGF, VEGF, and TGF. Similarly, the resorbable collagen membrane acts as a barrier to aid wound closure and guide tissue regeneration.

Thirty-six patients (22 males, 14 females; mean age 8.55 years) with alveolar clefts were enrolled and randomly allocated into three groups. Group 1 received autogenous chin bone grafting combined with PRF to repair the nasal layer; Group 2 received the same bone grafting along with a bovine collagen membrane; and Group 3, serving as the control, underwent conventional grafting with a watertight nasal floor closure. Preoperative assessments involved clinical evaluations and radiographic imaging using panoramic radiographs and CT scans.

Postoperative follow-ups, extending up to nine months, assessed clinical healing, flap integrity, infection, and graft stability, alongside radiographic measurements of bone density. Although all groups showed generally favorable healing with minor complications, the groups treated with PRF and collagen membranes demonstrated significantly improved bone density at nine months compared to the control. The findings suggest that both PRF and resorbable collagen membranes are beneficial adjuncts in enhancing osteogenesis and maintaining graft stability in alveolar cleft repair.","This study compares the effectiveness of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and resorbable collagen membranes in secondary alveolar bone grafting for children with cleft lip and palate. Thirty-six patients with alveolar clefts were randomly assigned to three groups: PRF with autogenous chin bone graft, collagen membrane with autogenous chin bone graft, and autogenous chin bone graft alone (control). The primary outcome was to evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes after using autologous platelet-rich fibrin versus a resorbable collagen membrane in secondary alveolar bone grafting

The study assessed the stability of maxillary segments, asymmetry of the alar base, presence of fistulas, cleft size, and tooth eruption stages preoperatively. Postoperative evaluations included clinical assessments (flap dehiscence, infection, graft loss, fistula recurrence) and radiological assessments (bone mineral density via CT scans) at various intervals.

While clinical complications were similar across groups, bone density measurements at nine months showed statistically significant improvements in the PRF and collagen membrane groups compared to the control group. The study concludes that PRF and collagen membranes, when used with chin bone grafts, enhance bone formation and density in alveolar clefts, serving as effective barriers.","This research paper evaluates the effectiveness of autologous platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) versus resorbable collagen membranes in secondary alveolar bone grafting for children with alveolar clefts.

To address this issue, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) have been proposed as valuable instruments for understanding the quality of healthcare from the patients? standpoint. Therefore, the aim of this project was to employ PROMs and PREMs questionnaires to capture the patients? perspectives regarding their experience during the orthognathic treatment process, as well as their perception of their postoperative state. Preoperative and postoperative questionnaires were offered to patients at consenting appointment and at various timepoints after the surgery. The assessment of statistical relationships was carried out by means of Fisher?s exact test. A total of 64 preoperative and 126 postoperative responses were received. The primary motivators for pursuing the surgery were the improvement of facial and dental aesthetics, as well as increased satisfaction with photographic and video appearances. These three factors were also cited as the most important postoperative benefits. Of the respondents, 58% reported experiencing altered sensation to the lower lip at the 24-month follow up (p¬†=¬†0.02); however, the affected patients reported that this did not have an impact on their daily activities. The use of PROMs and PREMs to appraise the quality of life constitutes a valuable method for surgeons to gauge their treatment efficacy. Above all, such tools are particularly useful for evaluating patient satisfaction, which is the ultimate objective of any treatment.","Introduction and background
Orthognathic treatment is a significant undertaking for both patients and healthcare teams, typically lasting 2½–3 years. Most patients are 18–19 years old, transitioning from school to university or college. Within the United Kingdom (UK), funding for this is provided by the National Health Service (NHS) and suitability can be determined based on the Index of Orthognathic Functional Treatment Need (IOFTN). Surgery is mostly recommended for IOFTN groups 4 and 5, which indicates a great or very great need for treatment and comprises a lengthy and complex treatment pathway.1 Surgical complications can range from relatively minor issues to more severe concerns, which include unfavourable mandibular split, nerve damage, and skeletal relapse.2–11 Therefore, this treatment demands a considerable amount of endurance and commitment.
Assessing the success of orthognathic treatment can be challenging. Studies focus on evaluating the incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications and have been able to quantify these outcomes. However, a significant issue arises due to surgeons’ and operators’ reluctance to share their complication rates, and when they do, it is typically because their complication rates are lower than the expected norm.12 Additionally, publication bias may also influence these findings.13 Hence, an alternative approach to assessing treatment efficacy would be to evaluate patient perception.14
Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) are well-established tools for assessing the quality of healthcare, as perceived by patients. These measures provide valuable insights into the patients’ perception of their care. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of PROMs and PREMs in medicine, resulting in a growing body of literature, including several systematic reviews on various topics.15,16 More recently, these measures have been adopted in surgical disciplines as a feedback tool.17–19 However, only a few studies use PROMS and PREMS to assess the quality of orthognathic treatment, both preoperatively and postoperatively, which represents gaps in both the literature and our knowledge. 20,21
Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop two PROMs and PREMs questionnaires, one for preoperative state and one for postoperative state. These were designed to assess patient satisfaction with the consent and treatment process, as well as their perception of treatment outcomes and postoperative complications. The primary objective was to capture the orthognathic treatment experience from the patients’ perspective. Additionally, the study aimed to identify the rate of postoperative sequelae reported by patients, to aid in the informed consent process for future patients.
Methods
The study included patients who underwent surgery performed by a single consultant surgeon since 2016, and data were collected using anonymous preoperative and postoperative questionnaires from 21 December, 2020, to 3 February, 2023. All surgeries were performed following initial orthodontic treatment. The pre-surgical questionnaire was offered to patients during their consent and occlusal wafer fit appointment, while the post-surgery questionnaire was offered to them during various review stages following their operations. To maintain anonymity and avoid duplication, a discrete Excel (Microsoft Excel, 2016) spreadsheet was utilised to record the identities of patients who had been administered the questionnaire. The anonymous questionnaire was offered to patients as they concluded their consultation appointment, to be completed in the waiting room. Answer choices were presented as either a five-point Likert scale, or when comparing expectations, options of less than expected, as expected, or worse than expected were suggested.
The collected responses were processed using Excel software (Microsoft Office, 2016), and subjected to statistical analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics software (version 24.0, IBM Corp). The statistical significance levels were set at p < 0.05. Fisher’s exact test was selected for the evaluation of statistical relations in binary outcomes, owing to its conservative nature relative to other tests and due to the limited sample size. Missing data were left unanswered, as indicated by the missing percentage values observed for certain questions.
The questionnaires utilised in this study were derived from two established, validated surveys.21,22 Given the lengthy and superfluous nature of certain questions in the original surveys (such as ‘I feel useless at times’), the authors chose to adapt them for the context of oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) only. Content validity of the questionnaires was evaluated through the consensus of a panel of six experts, consisting of three oral and maxillofacial consultants and three orthodontists. To determine the reliability of the adapted questionnaires, a test-retest method was employed. A random selection of ten patients from the postoperative group completed the survey in paper form, and then again online via Microsoft Forms Survey (Microsoft 365) within one week. Reliability was analysed using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) statistical model, and results for each individual question are available for review in Appendix 1 (online only).
Results
Preoperative questionnaire
A total of 64 patients completed the preoperative questionnaire; demographic distribution and intended surgical procedures can be seen in Appendix 2 (online only). Just under two-thirds (61%) of participants reported being bullied or teased at school due to their appearance.
The results of all possible reasons for having surgery are presented in Figure 1. When asked for the primary reason, eating problems emerged as the most common response (24%). Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of these responses and compares them with the reported benefits of the surgery.

Patients expressed a high level of satisfaction with the information provided regarding braces, treatment duration, complications, and informational resources such as leaflets, in which they produced an average rating of 1.0 (excellent) out of 5. The majority of patients reported being satisfied with their level of knowledge regarding the surgical intervention with an average rating of 1.03; the anticipated outcomes received an average rating of 1.07, associated risks and benefits received an average rating of 1.1, as well as the expected changes in dental and facial aesthetics which was given an average rating of 1.2.
Patient feedback indicated that the use of 3D planning technology contributed to an increased sense of personalised surgical intervention, thereby increasing their confidence in the expected outcomes, with an average rating of 1.12, which highlights high levels of satisfaction. Furthermore, patients reported being satisfied with the manner in which the surgical team explained the potential results of the intervention. Ultimately, the overwhelming majority of patients (92% of respondents) expressed their willingness to recommend the department and treatment to others, thus demonstrating the quality of care provided by the healthcare team.
Postoperative questionnaire
A total of 126 unique post-surgery questionnaire responses were received, with an average time since surgery of 20 months. Of the respondents, 15 were from the first six months after surgery, 100 at six months or more after surgery, and 11 did not disclose this information. The demographic distribution and performed surgical procedures can be seen in Appendix 2. When asked to choose the main improvement noticed after surgery, patients reported improved facial appearance, followed by improved eating (Fig. 2).
The mean rating given for pain on the first day after surgery was 3.3 (average). A comparison of this rating to the patients’ preoperative expectations indicated that most patients reported the pain to be less than or as expected (Table 1). The effectiveness of painkillers at the hospital was rated at 1.93 (good). The average pain intensity at home was reported as 3.22 (average), and most patients reported that this was less than or as expected. Additionally, 76% of patients reported that the prescribed painkillers were strong enough.

Patients rated the swelling after surgery as significant, with an average rating of 4.23. However, when comparing this to their expectations, the majority reported that it was as expected or less (Table 1). Similarly, the average rating for bruising after surgery was 2.98 (average), and the majority reported that it was less than or as expected (Table 1).
From the perspective of altered sensation, a total of 89% of respondents reported experiencing numbness or altered sensation after surgery, with 9% reporting no such experience and 2% did not answer this question. Figure 3 illustrates the specific areas where altered sensation was reported, with the chin being the most commonly reported area (76%), followed by the lower lip (69%). The vast majority reported that the altered sensation was as expected or less (Table 1). Nearly two-thirds (60%) reported persistent numbness in these areas at the time of completing the questionnaire, while 37% reported that the numbness had resolved. The effect of numbness on daily life was rated an average of 1.56 indicating little to no impact (Table 2).

The Hilotherm mask (Hilotherm GmbH) is a medical device used for controlled temperature therapy to reduce postoperative pain, inflammation, and swelling. Most respondents (95%) reported wearing it during their hospital stay, with 93% reporting that they felt it assisted with their healing process. Of these, more than half (59%) opted to rent a Hilotherm mask for home use, with rental periods ranging from 0-2 days (1%), 3-5 days (10%), 6-9 days (13%), 10-14 days (30%), to 14 or more days (6%). The majority (72%) of respondents reported perceived reduction in postoperative pain and swelling, and 33% noted a decrease in postoperative bruising.
Most respondents (73%) experienced difficulty breathing normally after surgery, with most reporting this as being as expected or less (Table 1). Additionally, 90% of respondents reported difficulty speaking after surgery, with most reporting this as being as expected or less (Table 1).
In terms of occupation at the time of surgery, 34% of respondents were engaged in manual-type jobs, 21% worked in a desk job, and 26% were students. Many respondents (31%) reported taking six weeks off work or school after the surgery (Fig. 4). When asked about their expectations, 75% reported that it was as expected, while 13% reported that it was less than expected, and 2% reported that it was worse. Nearly half (44%) of respondents reported that a parent or partner took time off work to assist with their recovery, with 25% taking one week, 17% taking two weeks, 2% taking three weeks, and 2% taking four or more weeks.

Discussion
This study allowed us to establish the reasons for and benefits of undergoing surgery. In the pre-surgical questionnaire, the primary reasons for having surgery were improved facial and dental appearance, as well as increased satisfaction with photographs and videos of themselves. These reasons were also among the top three benefits noted after having surgery, suggesting that the operation effectively addressed the key concerns of patients. Moreover, improved performance at work or school, better personal relationships, and increased happiness when meeting new people were all mentioned twice as frequently in the postoperative questionnaire, indicating other benefits of which patients were potentially unaware at the preoperative stage. Additionally, when asked to select their one main reason for surgery, the top reason was improved eating, followed by facial and dental appearance. In contrast, in the postoperative questionnaire, the primary benefit experienced by patients was that of improved facial appearance, followed by improved eating ability, and increased self-esteem. This suggests that patients’ preoperative reasons for undergoing orthognathic surgery were effectively addressed and that different benefits were noticed by patients after the surgery than were potentially expected prior to it.
Postoperatively, patients reported an average level of pain and bruising, while swelling was rated as significant. The vast majority reported using a Hilotherm mask and approximately two-thirds hired it for use at home. Most patients take off six weeks or more from work and school following the surgery, with manual-job workers tending to take more time off than students. Furthermore, almost half of the patients reported their parent or partner taking time off to help care for them after surgery. Overall, 83%-89% of cases reported experiencing the postoperative state as either expected or better than expected, which suggests that the consenting process is good.
Altered sensation is a significant risk of orthognathic surgery, with conflicting reported incidences ranging from minor occurrences to upwards of 90%. In our study, we have observed a higher incidence of altered sensation in comparison to some of the previously cited literature.4,6,7 Nevertheless, despite this apparent higher incidence, patients have reported negligible impact on their daily activities, and for the majority, they are not troubled by it.
Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. Firstly, the sample size of 64 pre-surgery responses and 124 post-surgery responses obtained by a convenience sample might limit the generalisability of the findings. However, given that this surgery is only regularly performed in some OMFS units, obtaining a larger sample size may pose a challenge. Secondly, statistical significance was only identified for the 18+ and 24+ month postoperative time points. The p value could have been influenced by the relatively small sample size of our study may which limits the statistical power of our analysis. Moreover, as the questionnaires were distributed at different timescales after surgery, the responses could have been influenced by recall bias. However, the aim was to ensure a wide spread of responses to understand how the recollection of postoperative state differs after various timescales. Overall, this project has successfully evaluated patient experiences as well as perception of treatment outcomes and postoperative state.
Conclusion
Assessing patients’ quality of life via validated measures like PROMs and PREMs is crucial for surgeons to evaluate performance and optimise patients’ satisfaction, providing a comprehensive evaluation beyond binary outcomes and risks. After surgery, patients’ motivations, such as improved appearance and satisfaction, were effectively addressed, with unexpected benefits such as improved daily function and social confidence. Despite a higher incidence of altered sensation, daily activities were impacted only minimally. Most patients felt their postoperative experience met or exceeded expectations, indicating effective informed consent and preparation. Further large-scale studies are needed to evaluate post-surgical experiences and outcomes, incorporating overall quality of life measures to better understand the holistic impact of orthognathic surgery.

Orthognathic treatment, a complex procedure lasting 2½–3 years, typically involves young adults (18–19 years) undergoing NHS-funded surgery indicated for severe functional treatment needs. Traditionally, surgical success has been gauged by clinical complications, yet these measures often underreport adverse outcomes due to surgeon reluctance and publication bias. In contrast, this research focused on patient satisfaction with both the consent process and postoperative outcomes.

Patients scheduled for orthognathic surgery completed a preoperative questionnaire during their consent appointment, while postoperative responses were gathered at varying intervals after surgery. The questionnaires, adapted from established surveys and validated by a panel of experts, explored patients’ motivations (such as improved facial aesthetics and eating ability) and satisfaction with information provided about braces, treatment duration, and risks. Preoperatively, most patients reported excellent satisfaction ratings, and nearly two-thirds had experienced bullying due to their appearance. Postoperatively, while average pain and bruising levels were as expected, significant swelling was noted. A high incidence of altered sensation was reported; however, its impact on daily life was minimal. Additionally, the use of a Hilotherm mask was well received, with most patients perceiving it as beneficial to their recovery.

Oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) is a specialised surgical branch that bridges the gap between medicine and dentistry. It includes the diagnosis and treatment of patients with pathology affecting the mouth, jaw, face, and neck. To qualify for OMFS training in the United Kingdom (UK), one must be dual accredited: in 1984, the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons made a commitment that future OMFS trainees would require both medical and dental degrees. Evidence shows that the majority of OMFS trainees undertook dentistry as their first degree, but an increasing number of undergraduates have completed medicine first.1 Nevertheless, it is vital that all undergraduates wanting to commit to another degree have adequate exposure to, and understanding of, the specialty.
High-quality teaching on OMFS and its career pathway for fifth-year dental students is crucial to foster competence and confidence and to ensure they acquire the comprehensive knowledge and skills essential for successful entry into this specialised field. It can also aid in better interdisciplinary collaboration between medical and dental specialties, in turn allowing for better patient care.
The training pathway for OMFS is known to be a long and rigorous journey so the objective of this research was to evaluate the perspectives of final-year dental students concerning their exposure to, and perceptions of, OMFS during their undergraduate teaching. By understanding their perceptions, future policy makers and educators can further tailor programmes to meet the evolving needs of future OMFS professionals.
There is, to our knowledge, a lack of recent literature on the topic that focuses on UK final-year dental students, which is why this assessment and evaluation is important.
Method
This was a cross-sectional cohort study that used an online survey (https://www.onlinesurveys.ac.uk) to collect data (Appendix A). All final-year dental students at a UK dental school who will graduate in 2024 were included.
Exclusion criteria included those who had completed a medical degree (MBBS) before their dental degree, and those graduating after 2024.
The survey questions were initially created by the lead researcher using previous literature with similar aims. The questions were split into three domains that included undergraduate exposure to OMFS, awareness of what OMFS is, and perceptions of it as a career path. Prior to national distribution of the survey, the questions were tested on a small group of dental students. Feedback was then obtained regarding the clarity and suitability of the questions, and changes were made accordingly.
For distribution nationally, dental students from 11 different UK dental schools were recruited as ‘university representatives’ to distribute the survey amongst the final-year dental students at their university. This distribution mainly took place through emailing the survey to the final years at their dental schools as well as through WhatsApp messages on year group chats. The survey collected responses for four weeks. All responses were anonymous, as no identifiable information was collected.
No ethics approval was required.
Results
Group demographics
A total of 189 dental students from 11of the 15 dental schools in the UK responded to the survey (Fig. 1). Of the respondents, 170 were final-year dental students. The 19 non-final-year students were excluded from the statistical analysis.

Teaching and exposure
Regarding undergraduate OMFS teaching, 116 (68.2%) respondents reported having received teaching from their dental school as part of their degree, 19 (11.2%) reported not receiving any teaching, and the remaining 35 (20.6%) were unsure.
With regards to what further teaching experiences the respondents felt would benefit their education most regarding OMFS, theatre sessions and small group seminars were the top two methods. A further breakdown can be seen in Figure 2.

Fig. 2 Response to the question “What further undergraduate experiences do you feel would have been of most benefit to your education regarding OMFS?
Regarding the exposure to OMFS, 122 (71.8%) respondents reported that they had been offered OMFS-related clinical placements by their respective dental schools, while 48 (28.2%) had not. Of the 122 who reported receiving placements, the placement lasted a mean of 3.78 days.
From our respondents 115 (67.6%) had shadowed an OMF surgeon as part of their dental degree timetable and 55 (32.4%) had not. When asked about self-organised exposure, 30 (17.6%) had done this to gain more experience.
A total of 103 (60.6%) reported that they had observed OMFS-related procedures during their time in dental school, whereas 50 (29.4%) had not; the remaining 17 (10.0%) were unsure. With regards to being’ hands-on’ and assisting in OMFS-related procedures during dental school, 62 (36.5%) stated that they had assisted, 96 (54.7%) had not, and 15 (8.8%) were unsure.
Regarding satisfaction, 86 (50.6%) were to some extent satisfied with the teaching and exposure provided by their dental school, 47 (27.6%) were neutral, and the remaining 37 (21.8%) were to some extent dissatisfied (Fig. 3).

Understanding of the career
Of the respondents, 163 (95.9%) were aware that full OMFS training requires dual qualification in medicine and dentistry, while 7 (4.1%) were not. Prior knowledge that dentistry graduates can apply for accelerated medical degrees in the UK was reported by 144 (84.7%) of the respondents.
When asked if they were aware of funding options for post graduate education, 26 (15.3%) were aware, the remaining 144 (84.7%) were not.
Regarding perceptions of the OMFS career pathway, 157 (92.4%) agreed to some extent that the training pathway for OMFS is longer than for other dental specialties, 3 (1.8%) disagreed, and the remaining 10 (5.9%) were unsure.
When asked if OMFS was more suited to medical than dental undergraduates, 40 (23.5%) agreed to some extent, 97 (57.1%) disagreed to some extent, and the remaining 33 (19.4%) were unsure.
Regarding further education, 128 (75.3%) to some extent agreed that students at the university would benefit from more OMFS career guidance, 14 (8.3%) to some extent disagreed, and the remaining 28 (16.5%) were unsure.
Participants were then asked if they thought they had adequate experience and information to make an informed choice regarding OMFS as a career, to which 70 (41.2%) responded that they did have that knowledge and experience whilst 100 (58.8%) responded that they did not. Responses to the question “To what extent do you agree with the statement ‘I understand the portfolio requirements for a career in OMFS’?” are shown in Figure 4.

Fig. 4 Response to the question “To what extent do you agree with the statement ‘I understand the portfolio requirements for a career in OMFS’?”
When asked if they would consider OMFS as a career in the future, 25 (14.7%) responded with 'Yes', 95 (55.9%) responded with 'No', and the remaining 50 (29.4%) were 'Undecided'.

Discussion
Our study overall shows a better understanding of the scope of OMFS amongst final-year dental students in the UK compared with their medical student counterparts from previous literature.2 However, our results do reflect areas in which knowledge, exposure to, and perception of, OMFS can be improved amongst dental undergraduates.
Regarding perception of OMFS, whilst the majority of questions regarding scope were answered well, over half of respondents believed that cosmetic surgery was not within the scope of OMFS procedures. The Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCSEng) clearly identifies cosmetic surgery as a principal subspecialty of OMFS, so our results indicate that many of the students do not appreciate the true breadth of the specialty.3
Self-reported awareness of portfolio requirements for the OMFS pathway was low. With one of the main OMFS pathways requiring application to core surgical training (CST), it is not surprising that undergraduate medical students would be more aware of these applications than their dental student counterparts. Whilst it is not imperative for dental students to be fully aware of CST, ST1, or ST3 requirements, knowledge of what these are can be useful in order to have an accurate understanding of the career pathway. Additionally, awareness of portfolio requirements can allow for better planning before working full time as a dentist, and mean that they could do things such as research and poster presentations while undergraduates. Our respondents also showed a desire for increased career guidance, as three out of four of them said they would like their university to give them more information on the OMFS career path.
There is a clear disparity between dental schools and their focus on OMFS teaching, as over a quarter of participants reported being offered no OMFS placements by their respective dental schools. It is also concerning that participants who were “unsure” when asked about receiving OMFS teaching, may have been so because it was never clearly signposted to them that the content related to OMFS. Lack of exposure can hinder future OMFS applications, interest in the field, and general confidence to manage patients and their referrals. With those who did report having OMFS-related placements, the mean number of days was less than a week. This can have real-world implications as there could be delays in the diagnosis, management, and/or referral of patients with OMFS-related complaints due to a lack of familiarity.
Overall, length of training and the financial expense of training were students’ top two most important concerns about qualifying to become an OMF surgeon. Our study also found that over 80% of our respondents were not aware of the funding options available for postgraduate medicine. More guidance on and awareness of how to navigate these potential barriers could widen participation in the field and therefore be of great benefit to the future of the specialty. These barriers have also been reported by UK medical undergraduates.2 BAOMS could work with universities to highlight financial support, or provide representatives to go and speak about their experiences during training and about how students can be supported financially. It is also important to note that regarding representation, we received additional feedback from several respondents who mentioned that they felt a lack of ‘female representation’ within OMFS, and how hearing from these surgeons would encourage them. As with any field, representation plays a key part in growing workforce diversity.
Further (possibly interview-based) studies and research should be carried out to better understand what students would like more of, and how they can be better supported by their dental school. Further research into dental student attitudes towards other specialties should also be carried out to see how specific these problems are to OMFS.
It is important to review and to create a standardised OMFS curriculum (with equal exposure to the specialty) for dental students from every university, and also to implement career guidance. To meet a minimum level of exposure before graduation and to ensure best practice throughout the BDS clinical years, clinical and examination requirements in the restorative, paediatric, and orthodontic specialties are set by the General Dental Council (GDC), and universities set regular assessments and clinical case discussions. The OMFS specialty could implement similar targets for students consistently throughout the years instead of leaving OMFS teaching towards the end of the five years, so that students can build further confidence in their perceptions and understanding of OMFS as a career. Increasing the number of integrated clinical sessions, seminars, and case-based learning between medical and dental students can increase knowledge and appreciation of OMFS for students from both backgrounds, and can aid dental professionals in liaising appropriately with other specialties for a multidisciplinary team approach, which is a GDC requirement.4
Limitations
It is important to note there may be bias in the responses as participants may have felt reluctant to admit they did not know as much about OMFS as their peers. Some participants may have been more interested in OMFS than others and hence may have had more knowledge about the career due to their own research rather than through their dental school. However, efforts were made to ensure anonymity to minimise bias. Students were also asked not to use any external resources to answer the questions but, as with any online survey, possible use of external resources can never be fully mitigated.
Whilst our sample size was large, not every dental school was represented. Further studies could evaluate each dental school’s curriculum to compare exposure and teaching.

We have no conflicts of interest.

Traditionally, most trainees have a dentistry background, although an increasing number now complete a medical degree first. Given this shift, it is critical that undergraduates gain adequate exposure to OMFS to build the competence and confidence needed for successful entry into this demanding field.

Using a cross-sectional design, the research deployed an online survey targeting final-year dental students graduating in 2024 from 11 UK dental schools. The survey—developed from prior literature and refined through preliminary testing—explored three key areas: the extent of undergraduate OMFS exposure, awareness of the specialty, and perceptions regarding OMFS as a career. Out of 189 respondents, 170 final-year students were analyzed. Findings revealed that 68.2% had received some formal OMFS teaching, although 11.2% reported receiving none and 20.6% were unsure of the exposure provided. Clinical placements were offered to 71.8% of the students, with an average duration of fewer than four days, and while many had shadowed surgeons, only a minority had hands-on involvement. Although nearly all respondents (95.9%) understood the dual qualification requirement, only 15.3% were aware of funding options, and a majority expressed concerns about the lengthy and costly training pathway. Ultimately, only 14.7% would consider OMFS as a career, underscoring the need for a more standardized curriculum, enhanced career guidance, and increased clinical integration to better prepare future OMFS professionals.","This UK study evaluated final-year dental students' exposure to and perceptions of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS). An online survey was conducted across 11 UK dental schools to assess undergraduate teaching, awareness of OMFS, and career path perceptions.

The results showed that while most students received OMFS teaching and clinical placements, satisfaction varied. A majority understood OMFS training requires dual qualifications, but awareness of postgraduate funding was low. While most knew OMFS training was longer than other dental specialties, students lacked confidence in portfolio requirements and making informed career choices. Interestingly, over half did not appreciate cosmetic surgery as part of OMFS's scope.

The study highlights disparities in OMFS exposure across dental schools and suggests a need for standardized curricula, increased career guidance, and improved financial awareness. The authors suggest implementing a standardized OMFS curriculum, increasing integrated clinical sessions and seminars. They also recommend further research to understand student needs and attitudes.

The evidence presented here should allow the reconstructive surgeon to better discuss outcomes with patients when considering surgical options for Class II maxillary defects.","Introduction
The reconstruction of maxillary defects following ablative surgery is controversial.1 It is determined by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the extent of the defect, patient specific considerations, and an often-underappreciated factor; surgeon preference.
Classification of maxillary defects has provided a framework upon which to base discussion of reconstructive options. The eminent classification system is the Brown’s Classification system,2 describing the vertical and horizontal extent of the maxillary defect. It is generally accepted that vertical Class II and III defects provide the reconstructive surgeon with the most difficulties in terms of a functional and aesthetic reconstruction.3
Maxillary defects present unique reconstructive challenges in terms of functional outcomes, aesthetic considerations and prosthodontic rehabilitation. Quality of life indicators demonstrate poorer outcomes for maxillary reconstruction compared with mandibular reconstruction.4
There are two common approaches: maxillary prosthetic obturation and free tissue transfer, comprising soft tissue only or a composite reconstruction. Newer techniques have been described, including the zygomatic implant perforated (ZIP) flap,5 but are currently limited in their application.
The reported rates of trismus following maxillectomy are variable, likely to be under-reported, and multifactorial in terms of patient factors, extent of defect, and reconstruction methods utilised.6
As authors we demonstrate our rates of trismus following maxillary resection, comparing free flap reconstruction to that of prosthetic obturation, in relation to Brown’s vertical classification. We hypothesise that the degree of trismus is unaffected by the type of reconstruction.
Ethical considerations
The outcome measures reported in this study are routinely collected as part of clinical practice. This research was approved by the University of Maryland Independent Review Board.
Patients and methods
The is a retrospective observational study reviewing trismus rates in patients undergoing a maxillectomy with subsequent reconstruction that required either a prosthetic obturator or free tissue transfer.
Patients who underwent a maxillectomy procedure between 1 January 2013 and 1 January 2021 at the University of Maryland were identified from the head and neck cancer multidisciplinary database.
The following inclusion criteria were identified:
•        
Diagnosis of oral cavity/sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) undergoing composite maxillectomy
•        
Reconstruction with either a prosthetic obturator or free tissue transfer
•        
Minimum of twelve months’ follow up with a complete data set
The following exclusion criteria were applied to the subsequent cohort:
•        
Synchronous oral cavity or sinonasal SCC
•        
Cases of recurrent or metachronous disease
•        
Benign pathology such as ameloblastoma, inverted papilloma, etc.
•        
Sarcoma of the head and neck requiring maxillectomy
•        
Reconstruction necessitating the use of multiple free flap or pedicled flap reconstruction
•        
Defects that were reconstructed with primary closure with or without buccal fat pad advancement
•        
Oligometastatic disease to the maxilla/sinonasal cavities
TNM staging according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) seventh edition7 was noted, along with Brown’s Classification (Vertical and Horizontal), type of free tissue transfer if applicable, delivery of subsequent adjuvant radiotherapy, and duration of follow up.
Oral rehabilitation, in terms of either an implant retained prosthesis, conventional denture or none at all is also documented.
The primary outcome measure in this cohort was maximal incisor opening (MIO), as measured using a range of motion scale method. The expectation is that a MIO was recorded prior to surgery, and at subsequent follow-up appointments including the study endpoint of twelve months. The twelve-month follow-up period also includes any adjuvant therapy received. The authors appreciate that the progression of trismus may occur past twelve months, and recognise that a small number of cases may not ultimately be accurately recorded.
Trismus, as defined in the literature, is mouth opening of less than 35 mm.8 Though a graded approach has also been utilised,9 describing trismus as Mild (<35 mm), Moderate (15–30 mm) and Severe (<15 mm). We have attempted to use both approaches in extrapolating patient data.
It is recognised that trismus in the setting of ablative head and neck surgery is multi-factorial.6 We have attempted to identify known confounding factors, and appropriately account for these factors in the subsequent analysis. Confounding factors identified include adjuvant therapy, stage of disease, Brown’s Classification, and intraoperative coronoidectomy. The data collection demonstrates that in the immediately postoperative period patients did not engage in jaw exercises; what is not clear from the data set is if, and at what point in time, did patients engage in any jaw physiotherapy.
Statistical analysis
The data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Apple version 25 (IBM Corp). A Shapiro–Wilk’s test was performed to determine the distribution of the sample. The test found that the cohort was not distributed normally.
Non-parametric tests were utilised based on the non-normal distribution. Fisher’s exact test for 2 × 2 contingency tables were used to analyse categorical variables. As an alternative, Pearson’s chi-squared test was used when less than 50% of the data had an expected count less than 5.
Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine associations between the dependent and independent variables accounting for confounding. A p value of less than <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.
A Wilcoxon sign rank test was utilised between the preoperative and postoperative mouth opening of all cohorts.
A Spearman rank correlation was done to compare the change in mouth opening with both Brown’s vertical classification and the stage of the disease.
Trismus was identified at below 35 mm. Trismus was further categorised into mild: <35–31 mm (Grade 1), moderate: 15–30 mm (Grade 2), severe :<15 mm (Grade 3)
Results
In the eight-year study period, 85 patients were identified that met the above-mentioned inclusion criteria.
Table 1 summarises the basic details of those included in the cohort, outlining the disease staging, Brown’s vertical and horizontal classification, patients undergoing coronoidectomy, as well as an indication of those patients receiving adjuvant therapy, and the numbers undergoing postoperative oral rehabilitation. They have been appropriately separated into reconstruction groups with an indication of whether trismus was evident at the study end-point.

Summary of collected demographics

Unsurprisingly, the most common T stage was T4 disease, with oral cavity SCC comprising the vast majority of the cohort in comparison to sinonasal SCC. The Brown’s II vertical defect was the most prevalent defect with 62 patients. The Brown’s B horizontal defect was not unsurprisingly the most common horizontal defect with 61 patients. A total of 36 patients underwent free flap reconstruction, with the fibular free flap being the most utilised free tissue transfer.
Due to the nature of the collected data, and in keeping with data indicating that Brown’s II/Brown’s B being the most common maxillary defect surgically treated, emphasis is focused on these defects in particular.
For completeness, patients who received an ipsilateral coronoidectomy at the time of surgery were also identified. Eight patients from the entire cohort received a coronoidectomy. Of the eight patients who received a coronoidectomy, five developed trismus. The rationale for coronoidectomy is not accurately recorded, and therefore the data are limited in their usefulness.

A Pearson’s chi-squared test between the occurrence of trismus and the two main methods of reconstruction was statistically significant (p = 0.011). This indicates that the reconstruction method of choice had an impact on the development of trismus. All methods of reconstruction will result in a degree of trismus, though the results are skewed based on the stage of disease/defect classification.
When reviewing the breakdown of trismus into the pre-determined group, the majority of patient did not develop trismus, though trismus was more apparent in the free flap cohort than the obturator cohort. The degree of trismus in both cohorts, if it occurred, was more likely to be in the moderate range, namely between 15 and 30 mm.

Pearson’s chi-squared test was not statistically significant (p = 0.06) denoting that there was no statistical difference between the reconstruction modalities and the occurrence rate of trismus for the reconstruction of Class II vertical defects.
On review of the basic data and the subsequent breakdown of trismus into the pre-determined groups, the obturator group appeared to demonstrate less trismus when compared with the free flap group. The majority of patients who experienced trismus were within the moderate group.

Pearson’s chi-squared test revealed a statistically significant result (0.002), denoting a significant difference in the rates of trismus between the two reconstruction methods.
Similarly to the Brown’s class II vertical classification, the use of an obturator demonstrated a lower rate of trismus occurrence compared to the use of free flap reconstruction. Once again, the majority of patients who suffered from trismus were within the moderate group.

Pearson’s chi-squared test was significant for developing trismus in the context of receiving adjuvant radiotherapy.
When reviewing the breakdown of trismus into the pre-determined groups, majority of the patients who developed trismus were within the moderate range.
The binary logistic regression model (See supplemental data, online only) used to determine the association between the two main reconstruction techniques (obturator and free flap) and the occurrence of trismus, adjusting for known confounders including; Brown vertical classification, adjuvant therapy and stage. The model had statistical significance (chi squared = 6.945, Nagelkerke R square = 0.480, p = 0.004).
The regression analysis demonstrated that the type of reconstruction affected the occurrence of trismus, where the obturator reconstruction technique was 2.51 times less likely to result in trismus (OR = 0.397, p = 0.025).
There was a moderately strong negative correlation (r = −0.393) between the change in mouth opening and the worsening stage of disease, which was statistically significant (<0.001).
The results were not statistically significant for the other discussed confounders.
Discussion
The reconstruction of maxillary defects following ablative surgery is contentious.1 Brown’s Classification of maxillary defects remains the eminent classification within the literature.2
Though the majority of the readership will recognise the classification system, and most likely use it in their day-to-day practice, the less quoted reconstruction algorithm is not universally accepted.10
The authors’ aim was to review the rates of trismus following reconstruction of maxillary defects in comparing free flap reconstruction versus prosthetic obturation. Quality of life (QoL) indices in head and neck cancer surgery have demonstrated the utmost importance patients place on a functional rehabilitation following successful treatment of the primary disease.11 This has resulted in a renewed focus by the treating team to ensure that oral rehabilitation following ablative surgery enables patients to maintain an appropriate standard of quality of life.
Though the scope of the manuscript may be limited, trismus is one of the pre-eminent factors in head and neck quality of life indices.12
Multiple factors are contemplated when considering an appropriate reconstruction for a maxillary ablative defect.1 These are often broadly separated into patient factors and surgical factors. Surgical factors include; extent of the expected ablative defect, involvement of the soft palate and risk of velopharyngeal insufficiency. Patient factors considered include medical comorbidities and fitness for possible free tissue transfer surgery, the manual dexterity to ‘manage’ an obturator, ability to attend multiple appointments, and the associated costs of a prosthetic replacement
The commonly employed approaches are prosthetic obturation and free tissue transfer reconstruction. Novel hybrid approaches, such as the zygomatic implant perforated (ZIP) flap, are gaining some traction within the literature.13
Comparison of the eminent reconstruction methods is extensively reviewed in the literature, and will not be recited here.14,15 Though it is generally accepted that patients will develop a degree of trismus following a maxillectomy,6 there is lack of comparative evidence when reviewing trismus rates in comparing reconstructive methods.
The evidence presented here demonstrates that all reconstruction techniques are likely to result in a degree of trismus. If trismus were to occur, it would predominately fall within the moderate group, with a maximal inter-incisional opening of between 15 mm and 30 mm.
Overall free flap reconstruction is more likely to result in trismus in comparison to a surgical obturator. Though not statistically significant, adjuvant therapy tends to increase the risk of developing trismus, which tallies with increasing rates of trismus in worsening stage of disease.
The majority of data presented here was for Class II/B defects or the combined IIB defects. The data suggests that the use of a surgical obturator has a decreased rate of trismus in comparison to free flap reconstruction. Though the data is insufficient to determine an exact quantitative difference.
The data are limited by the eclectic nature of patient presentations, particularly related to the extent of the defect within each Browns sub-classification, and subsequent utilisation of adjuvant therapy. The current study is underpowered with regards to these factors and thus limits external validity when discussing rates of trismus in a generalised manner.
Rates of trismus following reconstruction is not the sole arbitrator in the decision-making algorithm for the reconstruction of maxillary defects. Surgical obturators present difficulties with leakage, mastication and nasal escape leading to speech difficulties.16
Ohkoshi et al reported a non-statistical difference in the development of trismus between primary prosthetic obturation in comparison to free flap reconstruction.6 This highlights the difficulties in presenting eclectic data and emphasises an individualised patient approach to reconstruction.
Modern reconstructive head and neck surgery has moved away from ‘filling a hole’ to a more bespoke, patient-specific reconstruction. The evidence presented here, should allow the reconstructive surgeon to better discuss outcomes with patients when considering surgical options for Class II maxillary defects.

This research was approved by the University of Maryland Independent Review Board. Patient permission Not applicable.","This retrospective observational study evaluates trismus rates following maxillary reconstruction in patients undergoing ablative surgery for oral cavity or sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma. Maxillary defects—particularly vertical Class II and III as defined by Brown’s Classification—pose significant challenges in achieving functional and aesthetic outcomes, with trismus (mouth opening <35 mm) being a common complication. The research compares two primary reconstruction methods: prosthetic obturation and free tissue transfer (including soft tissue and composite reconstructions), focusing on maximal incisor opening (MIO) as the key outcome measure.

Eighty-five patients treated between January 2013 and January 2021, with a minimum follow-up of 12 months, were included. Patients were stratified by defect classification, disease stage, and adjuvant treatment received. Statistical analyses employed non-parametric tests, Pearson’s chi-squared, and binary logistic regression (adjusting for confounders such as Brown’s classification, stage of disease, and adjuvant therapy). Overall, while both reconstruction methods resulted in some degree of trismus, the obturator group demonstrated significantly lower trismus rates compared to the free flap group. In fact, the regression analysis revealed that prosthetic obturation was 2.51 times less likely to result in trismus (OR = 0.397, p = 0.025). Additionally, patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy experienced higher trismus rates, and a moderate negative correlation was noted between mouth opening and advancing disease stage.

The study underscores that although trismus is common following maxillectomy, the reconstruction method can significantly influence its severity. Despite limitations due to heterogeneous presentations and sample size, these findings support an individualized, patient-specific approach in maxillary reconstruction to optimize functional quality of life outcomes.","This retrospective study investigates trismus rates after maxillectomy and reconstruction, comparing prosthetic obturation and free flap reconstruction in 85 patients. The primary outcome was maximal incisor opening (MIO) measured at 12 months. The study found that free flap reconstruction was associated with a significantly higher overall trismus rate compared to obturation (p=0.011), particularly for Brown’s B horizontal defects (p=0.002) and combined IIB defects (p=0.007). While both reconstruction methods can result in trismus, it was predominantly in the moderate range (15-30mm mouth opening). Adjuvant radiotherapy significantly increased the risk of trismus. Logistic regression showed obturator reconstruction was 2.51 times less likely to result in trismus (p=0.025). The authors acknowledge limitations due to the heterogeneous patient cohort and highlight the need for individualized treatment planning.","This research paper investigates the rates of trismus (restricted mouth opening) following maxillary reconstruction after ablative surgery, comparing prosthetic obturation with free tissue transfer.

Vigilant follow up of patients with chronic alcohol use, those with teeth in the fracture line, and adherence to LSMO principles may help to minimise the non-union complication.","Introduction
Failure of a mandibular fracture to heal within an adequate timeframe resulting in a non-union is an uncommon complication. There is evidence to support the notion that inadequate fracture reduction and stabilisation resulting in persistent interfragmentary mobility are the main drivers of infection and non-union.1,2 Champy’s principles of load-sharing miniplate osteosynthesis (LSMO) are employed in dentate mandibular fractures (DMF) when good bony apposition post-reduction is possible. The stability of fixation provided by LSMO is usually adequate for satisfactory bony healing except in fractures with reduced quantity and quality of bone. Though the reported incidence of non-union ranges from 2.8% to 3.9%, most earlier studies include fractures treated conservatively or with less rigid fixation methods, or comminuted fractures with inadequate soft tissue coverage.3–6 It is possible that the incidence and contributing factors for non-union following LSMO may differ from those following other interventions. The current literature appears inadequate in this regard. This study therefore aimed to determine the incidence and identify contributing factors, if any, of non-union amongst DMFs that have undergone LSMO.
Material and methods
This IRB-approved study (JIP/IEC-OS/276/2023) was conducted in the oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) department of a public sector tertiary care medical school. Non-union was defined as mobility of the fracture segments after six weeks despite adequate fixation.3,7 The design of the study was a retrospective case-control study with an allocation ratio of 1:3.8 Hospital medical records over a five-year period (1June 2018 to 1 June 2023) were analysed to identify patients who had developed non-union fracture/s of the dentate portion of the mandible. The criteria for inclusion/exclusion in the non-union group are summarised in Fig. 1. The control group included a random selection of patients who underwent titanium LSMO of DMFs under general anaesthesia and whose medical records showed satisfactory bony healing with no documented evidence of non-union.

Fig. 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria for non-union group.
Relevant sociodemographic data, mandibular fracture characteristics, and treatment variables were collected for both groups of patients. All patient records and data were anonymised prior to analysis. The results were analysed using R version 4.3.2 (R: a language and environment for statistical computing. R Core Team, https://cran.r-project.org). The chi squared test or Fisher’s exact test was applied, odds ratios were calculated, and a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Twelve cases of non-union following LSMO of DMFs were retrieved from analysis of the medical records of 381 patients (3.1%). As per the predetermined allocation ratio, 36 patients who underwent an uneventful LSMO of DMFs during this period were randomly selected for comparative analysis (control group). Males with DMFs following road traffic accidents were predominant in both groups. An equal distribution of multiple-site DMFs was observed in both groups. The transoral approach was the preferred route for surgical access in a majority of patients in both groups. The time to ORIF was a statistically significant factor. In the control group the mean (SD) time to ORIF from injury was 5.5(3.31) days, range 1–10 days, and in those with non-union it was 8 (2.99), range 4–16 days.

All non-union cases underwent single-stage revision re-fixation surgery with rigid internal fixation. The extraction of retained teeth in the fracture line was required in seven patients at the time of the revision surgery. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) grafting was done in two mandibular angle fractures. Postoperative outcomes in all these cases were uneventful, with radiological and clinical evidence of fracture healing at subsequent follow-up visits (Table 2).

Persistent pain, purulent discharge, and malocclusion seen in patients with non-union of a DMF preclude return to a regular diet and dental rehabilitation. Non-union necessitates a return to theatre for further revision surgery, adding to the cost and morbidity. The potential risk factors for non-union are usually multifactorial and include severity of the fracture, delayed intervention, inadequate immobilisation across the fracture ends, smoking, alcohol, and poor patient compliance.3 It was unclear, however, if the patient cohort that required repeat fixation of the DMF following stable fixation with LSMO had a similar incidence and risk factors for non-union as those identified in the literature. The study recorded 12 cases of non-union amongst 381 LSMO of DMFs (3.1%), and found an association between non-union and chronic alcohol use, teeth in the fracture line, surgical site infection, and time from injury to LSMO.
It is commonly believed that delayed surgery of compound mandibular fractures is likely to increase the incidence of postoperative infections which, if inadequately treated, can result in persistent interfragmentary mobility, hardware failure, and non-union.2 Almost all studies that have examined the relation between time to intervention and surgical site infection (SSI) have been retrospective, with shortcomings such as incomplete data reporting, poorly defined outcomes, and substantial heterogeneity.9 Hurrell et al prospectively evaluated 359 mandibular fractures for which the time from injury to surgery ranged from 0 to 41 days (mean (SD) 4.7 (5.6) days). The outcome results recorded an incidence of 11% and 2% of infection and non-union, respectively. The study concluded that treatment delay did not significantly alter the incidence of postoperative infection.10 Sundheepkumar et al prospectively analysed 83 cases of DMF with delayed LSMO (median (range) 8 (4–19) days). They observed SSIs in eight patients with no statistically significant relation between delayed surgery and infection. Two patients developed non-union and both underwent load-bearing osteosynthesis (LBO) revision surgery with satisfactory healing.11 Our study, however, found that time to ORIF was a statistically significant factor.
When a fracture SSI is observed, our unit’s protocol is to perform local debridement and drainage, remove the odontogenic cause if any, confirm the optimisation of medical conditions, and prescribe antibiotics on a case-to-case basis. In all 12 cases of non-union, a fracture SSI was documented within the first two weeks postoperatively, but the infection could not be controlled with the above measures and eventually resulted in non-union. The four cases of fracture SSI in the control group were satisfactorily managed in outpatients, resulting in uneventful healing.
A surgeon’s challenge is to determine why some infections respond to local measures and antibiotics while others progress to a non-union. Teeth in the line of fracture are believed to be an important cause of SSI, with established guidelines on the decision to retain or remove a tooth.12,13 Often there might be no clear indication for the removal of teeth at the time of surgery, yet some teeth can get infected during follow up and require extraction. SSIs lead to bone “softening” due to the acidic environment induced by the bacteria, resulting in the loosening of fixation devices, sequestration of bone, loss of bone buttressing, and eventually, mobility of the fracture.14 In our study, only one tooth in the fracture line had been removed at the time of initial LSMO surgery in the non-union group, whereas 10 teeth had been removed at the time of LSMO in the control group. Eight patients with non-union underwent extraction of retained infected teeth in the line of fracture during follow up or at the time of re-fixation revision surgery. Early identification of teeth that are becoming infected and their prompt removal can help to control the infection faster, protect the hardware, and allow the bone to heal completely.2
The surgeon often encounters linear mandibular fractures accompanied by one or more comminuted free bone fragments at the inferior border. The surgeon’s predicament is to decide whether such fractures should be treated with load-sharing osteosynthesis, as the fragmentation is minimal or considered comminuted and fixed with rigid load-bearing plates. Sukegawa et al recorded four cases of non-union that required reoperation following ORIF of 126 mandibular fractures with either load-sharing or load-bearing osteosynthesis.15 All four cases of non-union were in comminuted fractures that were treated with a load-sharing miniplate fixation. They observed that with miniplates there was a significant difference in outcomes based on the number of free bone fragments and the presence of bone fragments requiring removal within 1 cm. They opined that for comminuted mandibular fractures with only one free bone fragment, treatment by miniplates may be possible. However, comminuted fractures that have two or more free bone fragments or that require the removal of fragments should be treated with rigid reconstruction plates.15 In our study, on re-examining the radiological imaging and operative notes of the initial LSMO of the non-union cases, we observed free bone fragments/bone removal in four cases. Rigid fixation at the initial surgery in these four cases may have avoided non-union. Rigid fixation systems, however, usually require an extraoral approach, a longer operating time, and potential over-treatment of the dentate mandibular fracture.
Another cause often implicated in unsuccessful treatment and non-union is patient compliance.16,17 Although what constitutes compliance is not unequivocal, it usually includes a soft diet, cessation of tobacco and substance abuse, good oral hygiene, and adherence to follow-up visits. The term compliance suggests that the patient alone is responsible for the failure of the fracture surgery, which is not always the case.18 A soft, non-chew diet is usually advised for four to six weeks in the postoperative period, though the specific timeline to return to a regular diet is often at the discretion of the surgeon. Manzie et al randomly allocated 146 patients to a two, four, or six-week modified diet schedule and observed no significant difference in the incidence of complications.19 Although 18 patients required a return to theatre, no details on the severity of the complication or the nature of the re-intervention was provided.19 In our study, the non-union group included nine patients who had assured us of compliance during follow up. We speculate, however, that some may not have been truthful. Other than considering adherence to a follow-up visit schedule as a surrogate marker for compliance, it is impossible for the clinician to be confident that the patient has diligently adhered to the postoperative instructions. Despite patient assurance of compliance with a soft diet, some fractures do not heal, probably because of undetected parafunctional habits such as bruxism.20 The presence of prominent wear facets on the teeth can identify high-risk patients, and whether these patients would benefit from a more rigid load-bearing fixation at initial surgery needs further research.
A positive correlation has been observed between tobacco and alcohol use and mandibular fracture infections.7 Radabaugh et al showed that smoking was associated with increased odds of non-compliance, but did not relate it to complications.21 Our study observed a positive association between chronic alcohol abuse and non-union (odds ratio: 1.4). A recently published study observed a return-to-theatre (RTT) rate of 6% for repeat surgery following LSMO of mandibular fractures, and the only patient risk factor with significantly increased odds of developing a complication that required a RTT was excess alcohol intake. As excess alcohol intake could be considered a proxy for generalised compliance with a soft diet, the study recommended consideration of the treatment of such patients with LBO.22
Another poorly investigated factor contributing to ORIF failure and non-union is related to the operator. Poor alignment of fracture segments at repair, improper selection of plates and screws, and inadequate fixation will adversely affect the outcome of the treatment. Loosening of the bone screws can lead to fracture mobility and non-union. Loosening of screws is usually due to technical errors like inadequate cooling, improper angulation, or excessive reaming of screw holes and excessive force that causes stripping of the screws.23 Placing the first screw too close to the fracture line can also contribute to bony resorption near the fracture line and failure of the hardware (case 4, Table 2). Failure to passively adapt the miniplate during screw fixation can also result in loosening of the screws. This potential complication can be avoided by the use of locking miniplate systems wherein precise adaptation of the plate is not required. However, this system requires perpendicular placement of the screw to ensure that it locks into the plate. The consequences of these technical errors are often seen a few weeks after surgery when it becomes almost impossible to determine if the hardware failure and non-union are the result of surgeon factors, patient factors, or a combination of both in varying degrees. Steffen et al performed a retrospective observational study of 630 mandibular fracture patients of whom 17 (2.7%) had undergone revision surgery.24 Six senior consultants assessed the preoperative and immediate postoperative imaging of all cases of re-fixation to decide if treatment was done in accordance with AO principles. There were eight cases of re-fixation with a combination of AO treatment failure and patient risk factors. Of the six patients with no risk factors, five were judged to have received insufficient treatment according to AO principles. The authors observed that the quality of osteosynthesis was a major factor for long-term success, but admitted that the current guidelines might not be easy to apply in every case.24
To the best of our knowledge, our study is one of the few studies to examine the incidence and contributing factors for re-fixation revision surgery due to non-union following LSMO of DMF. The clearly defined inclusion criteria and outcome, standardised LSMO intervention, and case-control design are some of its strengths. The retrospective nature of the study, the sample size precluding logistic regression computation, the fact that it was slightly underpowered and included a predominantly younger population with few patients with systemic comorbidities in both groups, are some of the potential weaknesses.
In conclusion, although chronic alcohol use, teeth in the fracture line, and time to LSMO surgery showed statistical significance for non-union, the effect of technical errors by the surgical team cannot be discounted. The results of our study need to be confirmed with larger sample sizes or a higher power. Further research is also needed with regard to the consideration of LBO in uncomplicated DMF in chronic alcoholics and in DMFs with minimal fragmentation.

Non-union—defined as persistent mobility of fracture segments beyond six weeks despite adequate fixation—is an uncommon but significant complication. While previous reports cite non-union rates between 2.8% and 3.9% in mandibular fractures, this study focuses specifically on cases treated with LSMO, where optimal bony apposition is presumed.

Conducted as an IRB-approved retrospective case-control study at a public tertiary care medical school between June 2018 and June 2023, the researchers analyzed hospital records to identify DMF patients. Out of 381 patients who underwent LSMO, 12 (3.1%) developed non-union. A control group of 36 patients with uneventful healing was randomly selected. Data collected included sociodemographic details, fracture characteristics, and treatment variables, with statistical analysis performed using chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests (p < 0.05 considered significant).

The findings revealed a statistically significant association between non-union and three factors: delayed time to open reduction and internal fixation (mean time of 8 days in the non-union group versus 5.5 days in controls), the presence of teeth in the fracture line, and postoperative surgical site infections. Although chronic alcohol use exhibited an increased odds ratio (1.4), it was not statistically significant. All non-union cases required single-stage revision surgery with rigid internal fixation, often involving tooth extraction and, in some instances, platelet-rich plasma grafting.

The study concludes that both delayed intervention and intraoperative decisions regarding teeth in the fracture line are critical, and further research is needed to refine treatment strategies for DMFs managed with LSMO.","This retrospective case-control study investigated the incidence and contributing factors of non-union after load-sharing miniplate osteosynthesis (LSMO) in dentate mandibular fractures (DMFs). Analyzing 381 patients over five years, the study found a non-union rate of 3.1% (12 cases). Compared to a control group (36 patients with successful LSMO), statistically significant factors associated with non-union included retained teeth in the fracture line (p<0.001), postoperative surgical site infection (p<0.001), and delayed time to ORIF (p=0.02). While chronic alcohol use showed a positive association (OR 1.4), it wasn't statistically significant. All non-union cases underwent revision surgery with rigid fixation, achieving successful healing. The study suggests that managing teeth in the fracture line, minimizing delays to ORIF and prompt treatment of post operative infections are key factors in preventing non-union after LSMO in DMFs, and the potential role of the surgeon's technical skill should be considered.","This research paper investigates the incidence and contributing factors of non-union in dentate mandibular fractures (DMF) treated with load-sharing miniplate osteosynthesis (LSMO).

Data returned from NHS Digital about OMFS in 2022 did not accurately reflect known data. Alternative data was obtained from the General Medical Council with a Freedom of Information request for the OMFS specialist list in January 2024. These data were combined with a database of current OMFS trainees and retired OMFS consultants. For OMFS specialists, their date of entry onto the OMFS specialist list was used. For current trainees the average duration of OMFS training was added to the start date of their training. For both groups the gender cited on the GMC listing was used. The dataset consisted of 862 UK surgeons: 114 retired OMFS consultants, 571 currently on the OMFS specialist list and 177 in OMFS specialty training. Of this group 734 (85%) were male and 128 (15%) female. By plotting year of entry onto the OMFS specialist list for specialists and estimated year of Completion of Surgical Training for specialty trainees using linear projection in Excel?, gender parity of those joining the OMFS specialist list could happen in 2048 (24 years).","Introduction
It is widely accepted that a diverse workforce within a specialty is a strength, resulting in broader skills, experience and perspectives which are more likely to represent the patient populations we treat. In their 2022 paper Newman1 et al compared gender diversity between UK surgical specialties, excepting oral and maxillofacial surgery. Recent studies show female surgeons’ patients have less mortality and less morbidity.2,3
OMFS is a unique specialty with specialty trainees requiring both medical and dental degrees to enter training. Dual degree training has been required since 1985. Prior to 2010 almost all OMFS trainees' first degree was dentistry. Since 2010 the proportion whose first degree was medicine has steadily increased.4 The first female dual degree specialist completed training in 19675 and since then the gender balance has been on an upward trend.
This paper responds to two publications about gender in surgery. Newman et al1 published their paper ’Gender diversity in UK surgical specialties: a national observational study’ in BMJ Open in 2022. Their paper omitted the specialty of OMFS, even though it is one of the 10 surgical specialties recognised by the General Medical Council (GMC) in the UK. When Newman et al1 were asked why they did not include OMFS,6 the authors did not reply.
Also in 2022 the Royal College of Surgeons of England7 published erroneous figures for gender in OMFS. RCS stated OMFS consultants were 20% female,7 whereas in figures recently published, the numbers were nearer 7%.8 When the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS England) were asked from where their data was obtained, they said they were returned from NHS Digital.7
Workforce planning, understanding the current gender balance and making plans for the future all require accurate data. Placing accurate figures in the public domain is important.
The aim of this project was to publish accurate figures for gender in OMFS, review the gender balance across time of the specialty of OMFS and to plot a trend towards gender parity i.e. when those joining the OMFS specialist list would be 50% female.
Method
In 2022, following the publication of the Newman paper,1 data about the OMFS specialty was requested from NHS Digital. The data returned from NHS Digital are shared exactly as received in Table 1. The inconsistencies in the totals in these data are not typographical or transcription errors. They seem to be generated by rounding the numbers up/down to fives and tens. For the specailty of OMFS these data were inconsistent with previously published papers.4,5,8–10

Data returned from NHS Digital about Workforce in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery 2009–2022.
Open table in a new tab
NHS Digital figures for 2022 were 420 OMFS consultants, with 345 (82%) male and 75 (18%) female. In 2022 there were over 520 consultants in OMFS, so the NHS Digital figures are 100 (20%) fewer than the actual figures. The NHS Digital figures for OMFS Specialty Trainees (STs) in 2022 were 210 whilst the actual number of ST3-ST7 trainees were approximately 150, which means the NHS Digital figure was 60 (40%) more than the actual figure. It is unclear whether the NHS Digital figures include OMFS ST trainees who are not working in the specialty of OMFS i.e. those who are appointed to ST1/ST2 run-through posts but who are working in other surgical specialties to acquire core surgical experience and their MRCS exam. There are between 5 and 20 trainees in ST1/ST2 which would reduce the overestimate of OMFS specialty trainees by NHS Digital but the total would be much fewer than the 210 reported.
Using a Freedom of Information Request in January 2024, the OMFS Specialist List was received from the General Medical Council (GMC). These data were combined with a database of retired OMFS consultants and a database of OMFS specialty trainees assembled by direct contact with current trainees. The OMFS specialist list and database of retired consultants contained the date of entry onto the OMFS list. For current trainees the date they would join the OMFS specialist list was estimated by adding the average duration of OMFS training for male and females11 to the date when they entered training. Magennis et al11 previously reported that at ST1 the average time for female trainees to complete Specialty Training was 7.9 years and 6.6 years for males (expected duration of training 6-7 years), and at ST3 females complete training on average in 6.2 years and males 5.6 years (expected duration of training 5 years).
Results
The combined database of retired OMFS consultants, current OMFS specialists and OMFS trainees totalled 862 with 734 (85%) male and 128 (15%) female.
Of the 114 retired consultants 112 (98%) were male and 2 (2%) female. Of the 571 consultants currently on the OMFS list 503 (88%) were male and 68 (12%) female. Of the current OMFS trainees in ST posts, which includes those in ST1/ST2 (in run-through training acquiring core surgical experience and their MRCS in other surgical specialties) and ST3 onwards (specialty training) 119 were male (67%) and 58 (33%) female. These data are listed in Table 2.

The OMFS specialist list was created in 1996 in response to European Union legislation. All existing OMFS consultants who were medically qualified were added to the list. OMFS consultants who were solely dentally qualified could not be added to the list, but they remained consultants in oral and maxillofacial surgery. As new specialists were added to the list, their date of entry was recorded. All OMFS specialists who joined the specialist list between 1996 and 2023 are on the list.
The numbers in Fig. 1 after 2023 are specialty trainee estimated CCT dates using the start date of their training and adding average duration of training to these dates.

Fig. 1 Gender of OMFS specialists joining OMFS specialist list and estimated joining date of trainees.
Since the OMFS list started, there have been five years in which no females joined the OMFS list, with 2009 being the most recent and the others being 1997, 1998, 2001 and 2004.
Reviewing the years where the largest percentage of females joined or would be expected to join the OMFS list, the highest will be 45% in 2028 with six cohorts above 25%, these being 2021 (28%), 2022 (28%), 2024 (28%), 2027 (32%), 2028 (45%), 2029 (36%) and 2030 (40%). These data are shown in Figure 1
Using the percentage of male and female surgeons joining the OMFS specialist list each year, the data points were plotted and extrapolated using linear analysis on Excel ©.
These data were plotted on Fig. 2. Using linear projection, gender parity of those joining the OMFS specialist list may happen in 2048 (14 years). Parity for the numbers of specialists will take a further 17 or more years assuming there are no significant changes in duration of training or retirement ages.8

Discussion
Newman Paper – comparison with other surgical specialties
The Newman Paper used NHS Digital data from 2020 which showed significant gender difference for consultants and specialty trainees (both p<0.001). Female representation for each specialty were listed (from highest to lowest):
Specialty Registrars—Ophthalmology 49%, Otolaryngology 48%, Paediatric Surgery 46%, Plastic Surgery 42%, General Surgery 40%, Urology 32%, Vascular Surgery 25%, Neurosurgery 25%, Cardiothoracic Surgery 21%, and Trauma and Orthopaedics 21%.
Consultants— Ophthalmology 32%, Paediatric Surgery 32%, Plastic Surgery 21%, General Surgery 18%, Otolaryngology 17%, Vascular Surgery 14%, Urology 12%, Cardiothoracic Surgery 11%, Neurosurgery 8%, and Trauma and Orthopaedics 7%.
They noted a significant positive trend in female representation of specialty registrars between 2011 and 2020 for all specialties except for Paediatric Surgery (consistently >45%) and Vascular Surgery (consistently <30%).
General Surgery was estimated to achieve gender parity of their specialty registrars by 2028, Urology by 2033, Neurosurgery by 2064, Trauma and Orthopaedics by 2070, and Cardiothoracic Surgery by 2082.
In the context of these data, OMFS sits roughly in the middle of the trendlines for growth of female proportions of surgeons.
NHS Digital data
Collecting data on the NHS workforce, including data about surgical specialties, is difficult. NHS Digital information is derived from the Electronic Staff Record (ESR), which is reliant on information recorded in hospitals. The specialty of some OMFS consultants is not recorded as OMFS on ESR. It seems likely that some consultants from other specialties are recorded as OMFS. It is not clear how erroneous data can be corrected. Specialty Trainee numbers on NHS Digital are based on contract types rather than possession of a National Training Number (NTN). Unfortunately, these errors mean that NHS Digital data are unreliable. This unreliability is worrying as national planning for surgical workforce purposes uses these data.
We have concerns that the data used by Newman about other surgical specialties may be no more accurate than NHS Digital’s data about OMFS. In addition to the fundamental inaccuracy there are also numerical (rounding) errors in the NHS Digital data, as mentioned earlier. To track workforce changes across time requires accurate information. Data from NHS Digital about gender in surgery provided to the Royal College of Surgeons of England and published on their website7 was inaccurate. The NHS Digital data about OMFS sent to the RCS England and to the authors did not match the peer reviewed data about numbers and gender in the specialty of OMFS.4,8
Changing gender with time in OMFS
Concerns over NHS Digital data calls into question the trends shown in Newman et al1. However, if the Newman data are correct, our data places OMFS gender trends within those of other surgical specialties. In a recent census undertaken by the Royal College of Surgeons of England with all its resources, the data returned directly were limited.12
The total duration of OMFS training, from the start of the first degree until entry into the specialist list, is approximately 20 years.11,13 This means the relevant data for those currently joining the OMFS specialist list in the year 2024 are the admission ratios to medical and dental schools of the early 2000s. The proportions of female representation at UK medical and dental schools has been between 55% and 65%14 for most of the last 20 years. This is not reflected in OMFS or in other surgical specialties.1,15
The reasons that young dentists and doctors are attracted towards or away from OMFS careers has been reviewed16,17 and there are many similarities with studies of other specialties.18
OMFS is different to other surgical specialties in that it requires a second undergraduate degree, but the age at which OMFS trainees join the specialist list compares favourably to other surgical specialties.13 The gender differences cannot simply be put down to the nature and duration of training.
Conclusion
Removing all factors that specifically hinder women entering a surgical speciality involves detailed and ongoing examination of recruitment and retention. OMFS has a significant problem with recruitment19 but agrees20,21 that the solution to these issues is implementation of the recommendations of the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board22 i.e. incorporating the second degree into specialty training. Those involved in specialty recruitment at all levels must actively challenge established norms23 within surgical training and careers. Gender disparity is a well-established and multifactorial problem in surgery. To maintain or, ideally, accelerate the trend towards gender parity will need focus, imagination and persistence.
Surgery has a problem with gender bias and poor behaviour to female colleagues and trainees. OMFS consultants have been leaders in changing the culture within surgery.24 The Kennedy Report highlighted that the cultural issues are not just gender based but include all possible conscious and unconscious bias.25 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS) has an Inclusion, Equity and Diversity Policy26 and has made steady progress as measured by gender diversity in key roles and at conferences.
For OMFS to continue the progress shown in this paper will require constant attention, extreme focus and full engagement from the whole specialty. The whole specialty includes those studying for their first degree who should look forwards and find ‘If you can see it, you can be it’27, all the way to the most senior consultants who must continue to work to change the norm.23
It is possible OMFS will reach gender parity much sooner than some of the other surgical specialities, where in some it has been predicted it could take up to 60 years.1 However gender parity for those joining the specialist list each year will take many years to translate into gender parity on the OMFS specialist list. There is much work yet to be done.

Unlike other specialties examined by Newman et al. (2022), OMFS was omitted from previous analyses despite being one of the ten UK surgical specialties. OMFS is unique because entry into specialty training requires dual degrees in medicine and dentistry—a requirement established in 1985. Historically, most trainees held a dental degree, but since 2010 there has been a steady increase in those with a medical degree, accompanied by a gradual rise in female representation.

To address inconsistencies in workforce data, particularly those from NHS Digital that showed significant numerical inaccuracies, the study combined data from multiple sources: NHS Digital figures, a Freedom of Information request from the General Medical Council, records of retired consultants, and direct trainee databases. The combined dataset included 862 OMFS practitioners, with 85% male and 15% female overall. Consultant figures revealed even greater gender imbalance, while specialty trainees showed a relatively higher proportion of females (33%). Using linear projection, the study estimates that gender parity in new entries to the OMFS specialist list could be reached by 2048, though achieving full workforce parity may take considerably longer.

The authors argue that accurate data is crucial for workforce planning and that overcoming gender bias in surgery requires ongoing efforts in recruitment, retention, and cultural change. They call for the implementation of recommendations to integrate the dual degree into specialty training and for the entire specialty to actively challenge existing norms to accelerate progress toward gender parity.","This paper investigates gender representation within Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) in the UK, addressing inaccuracies in previously published data, particularly a 2022 paper that excluded OMFS and erroneous figures from the Royal College of Surgeons of England. The study aims to provide accurate figures for gender balance in OMFS, track its historical trend, and project the timeline for achieving gender parity.

Researchers analyzed data from NHS Digital, the GMC specialist list, and trainee databases, revealing a disparity between reported and actual numbers. While NHS Digital data proved unreliable, the combined data showed a gradual increase in female OMFS specialists over time. Projections based on current trends suggest gender parity in new specialists joining the OMFS list could be reached by 2048, but achieving overall gender parity on the specialist list will take much longer.

The paper contextualizes OMFS within broader surgical specialties, highlighting that OMFS falls roughly in the middle in terms of gender diversity progress. It emphasizes the importance of addressing recruitment and retention challenges, promoting inclusivity, and challenging established norms to accelerate progress towards gender equality within the specialty.","This research paper investigates gender diversity in the UK's Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) specialty, emphasizing the need for accurate workforce data to address gender disparities.

This study aimed to compare the accuracy of freehand chin repositioning with a guided technique that employed specialised surgical guides. For this retrospective study, data from 30 adult patients who underwent orthognathic surgery to correct dentofacial deformities were analysed. All patients underwent virtual planning before surgery, with half of them treated using freehand chin repositioning and the other half using the guided technique. The surgical outcomes were measured and compared with the virtual plan to assess the positional and rotational accuracy of the techniques. In terms of translational assessment, noteworthy values that exceeded clinically acceptable limits were observed only in sagittal movement in the freehand group (0.97¬†mm, interquartile range (IQR) 0.73?2.29¬†mm). Regarding rotational accuracy, both groups exhibited an IQR that surpassed acceptable limits for pitch (3.26¬∞, IQR 2.06?5.20 for the guided group and 2.57¬∞, IQR 1.63?4.24¬∞ for the freehand group). The Mann-Whitney test indicated no statistical differences between the groups in any translational or rotational assessment. In conclusion, although there was no statistical difference, the guided technique proved effective in achieving clinically acceptable accuracy in all positions and almost all rotations, displaying superior results in sagittal positioning compared with the freehand technique. To fully harness the advantages of guides and to guarantee accuracy in all rotations, we recommend further research involving guides made of more rigid materials, and customised implants.","Introduction
The chin is a crucial component of the complex facial structure and significantly contributes to facial symmetry and harmony.1 This harmony of the facial profile is influenced by factors such as the size, shape, position, and proportion of the chin in relation to other facial elements.2,3
Genioplasty is a widely employed surgical technique for addressing chin deformities. Since its initial description by Trauner and Obwegeser in 19574 it has undergone substantial improvements. The location of the osteotomy and manipulation of the bony segment have a direct impact on the surgical results.5
Various methods can be employed in genioplasty to establish the position of the osteotomy line during surgery and to evaluate and guide the movement of the distal osteotomised chin segment.6,7 In the past it relied heavily on the surgeon's experience, and preoperative planning and measurements were limited.8 Currently, surgeons can formulate highly effective surgical plans through the application of computer-aided surgical simulation (CASS) technology.9,10 Preoperatively they can also design surgical guides that can be precisely transferred to the patient in the operating room, aligning with the planned movements made on the computer.11,12 Despite numerous articles in the literature detailing various techniques for designing surgical guides and praising their advantages and ability to achieve accurate results, few have compared these outcomes with those obtained using the freehand repositioning technique.11,13,14
The objective of this study therefore was to assess these techniques and to compare the accuracy of freehand repositioning of the chin with that of the guided technique.
Material and methods
Ethics
This work was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Research of the São Paulo State University (Unesp), School of Dentistry, Araraquara, under protocol number 69751123.1.0000.5416.
Sample
Through non-probability convenience sampling, data were collected from the computed tomographic (CT) examinations of 30 adult patients who underwent orthognathic surgery (including genioplasty) to correct dentofacial deformities between 2019 and 2023. Genioplasty was achieved using the freehand repositioning technique in 15, and the proposed guides in the remaining 15. Notably, these patients had not undergone any prior surgical procedures in the maxillofacial region, such as Le Fort I osteotomy, sagittal osteotomy, surgery for trauma treatment, or interventions for maxillofacial pathology. The type of chin deformity and the magnitude of the surgical movements performed were not standardised. A total of 30 preoperative CTs and 30 immediately postoperative CTs were used in the study.
Surgical planning and surgery
Virtual planning was performed using Dolphin Imaging 11.95 Premium software (Dolphin Imaging and Management Solutions) to generate stereolithographic (STL) models of the segments in the planned position. Surgical guides were designed using Materialise 3-matic 17.03 software (Materialise). The surgeries were performed by different surgeons from a single centre (Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Traumatology Service of the School of Dentistry, Araraquara – São Paulo State University).
Design of the guides
To position the guides precisely without requiring a large bone contact area, we use an occlusal-supported drilling guide (G1). This allows us to minimise the incisions and dissection. The drilling guide (G1) facilitates adequate positioning of the cutting guide (G2), which is secured in place by two screws in the inferior holes to prevent rotation. This method eases the osteotomy process and preserves vital structures. After completing the osteotomies, the positioning guide (G3) is employed to reposition the chin segment by inserting two screws in each segment using the pre-drilled holes. Once the final position of the genioplasty is achieved, a 2.0 titanium plate is used to secure the chin segment while the positioning guide (G3) is still in place. This set is illustrated in Figures 1–3, respectively.

Methodology for analysis of chin positioning accuracy
The accuracy of the genioplasty was evaluated by comparing 3D virtual surgical planning (3D VSP) with the postoperative outcomes. Initially, a voxel-based application15 was used to superimpose the areas that were not moved by surgery (the distal mandibular region above the osteotomy of the genioplasty) in both preoperative and postoperative CT scans. Thus, postoperative DICOM files were also segmented, creating postoperative STL models. Planned and postoperative outcome STL models of the mandible and chin were imported into Materialise 3-matic 17.03 (Materialise) to quantify the linear and angular differences between planning and outcome.
To avoid observer bias, three reference points were initially digitised on the chin segment of the planned model: the pogonion and two points located at the right and left lower borders of the chin segment. A “reversed” routine developed by Xia et al9 and Hsu et al11 was used to ensure correspondence of these points between the planned and the postoperative images.

To measure the differences, the centroid of the chin was calculated. The centroid coordinates (xc, yc, zc) are the mean of the coordinates to the three reference points created in both STL surfaces (3D VSP and postoperative).11 We computed differences in the x-axis (transversal), y-axis (sagittal), and z-axis (vertical), between the planned and postoperative centroid positions. We also calculated rotational differences, including pitch, roll, and yaw. To accomplish this, we created corresponding lines on both surfaces. The first, between the lower border points, was used to evaluate roll and yaw discrepancies. The second, between the pogonion and the midpoint of the first line, was used to evaluate pitch discrepancies. All data were presented as absolute values.
Statistical analysis
Initially, we ensured that the minimum number of individuals to guarantee the reliability of the research was met through a sample-size calculation. The data regarding accuracy, tabulated in Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft Corp), were subjected to statistical analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 20 (IBM Corp). Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) tests were performed with 20% of the total sample (6 individuals) to assess inter-observer and intra-observer reliability (where <0.50 = low reliability; 0.50–0.75 = moderate reliability; 0.75–0.90 = good reliability; and >0.90 = excellent reliability). Accuracy was assessed using Tukey-Hinges interquartile ranges (IQR) to determine if the techniques achieved results within the limits described in the literature as clinically acceptable. The Mann-Whitney U test was employed to statistically compare the two groups for each available variable.
Results
The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was applied to assess inter-observer and intra-observer reliability with a 95% confidence interval (CI), demonstrating excellent reliability (>0.90) for all variables.
To help interpret the results of the accuracy measurements for the chin, some authors have considered positional differences smaller than 2 mm and rotational differences smaller than 4° to be clinically insignificant.16–18 The linear and angular differences between the planned and postoperative chin segments, along with their interquartile range (IQR) are presented in Table 1. Regarding the translational assessment, it is important to note that the measured values exceeded clinically acceptable limits only in relation to sagittal movement in the freehand group (0.97 mm, IQR: 0.73–2.29 mm). Regarding rotational accuracy, both groups exhibited an IQR that exceeded the acceptable limits for pitch (3.26°, IQR 2.06–5.20 in the guided group and 2.57°, IQR 1.63–4.24° in the freehand group). The Mann-Whitney test results presented in Table 1 show no statistical differences between the groups in any rotational or positional evaluation.

To interpret the differences obtained between the planned and achieved outcomes more specifically, differences were also measured considering the direction of error, as illustrated in box-plot graphics (Figs. 4 and 5). It is important to note, however, that these values were not used to determine the accuracy of the techniques but rather to ascertain the error trend. For this purpose, movements were defined as: vertical (positive downward, negative upward), sagittal (positive forward, negative backward), transversal (positive right, negative left), and rotational in all views (positive clockwise, negative counterclockwise).

Discussion
Chin repositioning is an important technique to achieve facial balance. However, some features of the surgery, such as bone density, adequate visualisation, and difficult bone repositioning, can make adequate repositioning difficult.19
The use of a surgical guide obtained through 3D-printing technology has the potential to enhance outcomes through 3-dimensional simulation. Several researchers have published case reports and technical notes regarding guides to achieve an optimal chin position.19–25 Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the majority of these articles are case reports or series with a low level of evidence.4
We know of only two sets of authors who have conducted studies with a higher level of evidence, comparing the results obtained in groups of patients with and without the use of surgical guides. In 2013, Hsu et al11 conducted a multicentre prospective study to assess the accuracy of a CASS protocol for orthognathic surgery in which they compared linear and angular differences in the chin segment between groups treated with and without the use of a template. The results demonstrated that compared with intraoperative measurements, the chin template provided greater accuracy in repositioning the chin segment. In 2017, Li et al13 conducted a prospective controlled study to assess the accuracy and clinical validation of a novel genioplasty template system. The study suggests that the system offers greater accuracy in repositioning the chin than traditional intraoperative measurements. Furthermore, the computerised plan can be accurately transferred to the patient for genioplasty.
Despite demonstrating the superiority of the groups using guides, both articles based their evaluations on measurements that considered the direction of the difference. There are two ways to analyse positional and rotational differences between planned and achieved bony segments. Results can be presented considering the direction of displacement (negative and positive values) or in absolute terms. It is crucial to note that, when analysing only the directional mode, positive values can cancel out negative values, underestimating the differences and potentially influencing the results. Thus, to assess the accuracy of a certain technique, it makes more sense to use absolute values, reserving directional values solely to determine the trend of the error.
In this study, when evaluating the group that underwent genioplasty without the use of guides, it can be observed that the technique was not accurate enough to ensure the sagittal position (0.97 mm. IQR 0.73–2.29 mm) and pitch rotation (2.57°, IQR 1.63–4.24°). When we examine the error trend, the values that consider the direction of movement indicate that the chins ended up further back than planned, and experienced a slightly greater clockwise rotation than intended. One potential explanation is the challenging nature of precisely controlling sagittal translation and pitch rotation of the chin segment freehand, especially during fixation. While marker lines may offer useful guidance for transversal translation, their utility in assisting the surgeon to control the rotation of the chin segment is limited.13
The guided group displayed difference values that exceeded accuracy limits only in pitch rotation (measuring 3.26°, 2.06–5.20°), while all other positions and rotations were within the expected range ensured by the technique. When we examined the error trend, the direction of movement also indicated that the chins tend to have a somewhat clockwise rotation bias.
The increased imprecision in pitch, even with the use of guides, is consistent with previous findings. Li et al13 discussed two hypotheses for this. The first is that the repositioning guides are applied only to the buccal side of the chin segment. The retraction force of the soft tissue, mainly from the suprahyoid depressor muscles, is considerably larger, causing the slim-designed repositioning guides to be mildly deformed. Although visually unnoticeable, this deformation may directly result in an unexpected posterior displacement and pitch rotation of the chin segment before rigid fixation is applied. The second hypothesis is that the titanium genioplasty plate is not rigid enough to resist the retraction force from these same muscles after the patient wakes up from general anaesthesia. In addition to these two hypotheses, suboptimal pitch outcomes could potentially be influenced by factors such as internal bony contacts or the use of onlay bone grafts. To address this issue, guides made of more rigid materials or patient-specific implants could be utilised and tested.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that compared to our guided method, patient-specific implants involve increased time and cost.26 Obtaining a custom implant for one patient demands a skilled technician and proper production, while in-house fabrication of the guides is feasible, making the process more accessible.
Despite the noticeably better results in achieving translational positioning and the suboptimal outcomes regarding pitch, the advantages offered by the use of guides should not be limited solely to accuracy. These guides help the surgeon to avoid contact with surrounding noble anatomical structures such as dental roots and the mental nerve. The design allows for genioplasty to be performed with minor incisions and less dissection, and the elimination of the need for repeated intraoperative measurements and visual assessments makes it possible for a less experienced surgeon to achieve more ideal outcomes.
Conclusion
Although it did not demonstrate statistically significant differences when compared with freehand chin repositioning, the guided technique proved effective in achieving clinically acceptable accuracy in all positions and almost all rotations except pitch. To ensure the advantages offered by the guides and to guarantee accuracy in all rotations, we suggest further research involving guides made of more rigid materials, as well as customised implants.

Patient permission obtained","This study evaluated the accuracy of genioplasty chin repositioning using a guided surgical technique compared to the traditional freehand method. The chin plays a crucial role in facial symmetry and harmony, and its proper repositioning is essential for an optimal facial profile. Since the initial description of genioplasty in 1957, techniques have evolved with the advent of computer-aided surgical simulation (CASS), allowing precise preoperative planning and the design of surgical guides.

In this study, 30 adult patients undergoing orthognathic surgery for dentofacial deformities were retrospectively analysed using preoperative and immediate postoperative computed tomographic scans. Fifteen patients received freehand repositioning while the remaining 15 were treated with a guided approach utilizing occlusal-supported drilling, cutting, and positioning guides designed with Dolphin Imaging and Materialise software. The accuracy of chin repositioning was measured by comparing three-dimensional virtual surgical plans with postoperative outcomes, evaluating translational differences in the transversal, sagittal, and vertical axes, as well as rotational differences in roll, pitch, and yaw. Clinically acceptable limits were defined as less than 2 mm for translations and less than 4° for rotations.

Results indicated that both methods generally achieved acceptable outcomes; however, the freehand technique showed imprecisions in sagittal movement and pitch rotation, whereas the guided group demonstrated discrepancies primarily in pitch, likely due to guide deformation and soft tissue retraction forces. Although no statistically significant differences were observed between the groups, the findings suggest that further improvements—such as using more rigid materials or customised implants—could enhance pitch accuracy and overall surgical results. Further study.","This study compared the accuracy of freehand chin repositioning in genioplasty to a guided technique using 3D-printed surgical guides. Thirty patients undergoing orthognathic surgery with genioplasty were divided into two groups: one using freehand repositioning and the other utilizing surgical guides designed for precise osteotomy and chin segment placement. Postoperative CT scans were compared to virtual surgical plans to measure linear and angular differences in chin position. While both techniques showed excellent inter-observer and intra-observer reliability, only the freehand technique did not achieve clinically acceptable accuracy in sagittal movement. Both groups exceeded acceptable limits in pitch rotation. Despite the lack of statistically significant differences between the groups, the guided technique demonstrated effectiveness in achieving clinically acceptable accuracy in most positions and rotations, suggesting its potential benefits in surgical precision and avoiding anatomical structures, and reduced dissection. The study suggests further research with more rigid guide materials or customized implants to improve pitch rotation accuracy.","This research paper evaluates the accuracy of two techniques for chin repositioning in genioplasty: freehand repositioning and guided repositioning using 3D-printed surgical guides. The chin is a critical component of facial harmony, and genioplasty is a common surgical procedure to correct chin deformities. While traditional freehand techniques rely on the surgeon’s experience, guided techniques use computer-aided surgical simulation (CASS) to design precise surgical guides, potentially improving outcomes.",18,3,19.48,,,90,95,10,100,85,85,10,100,72,75,20,90

This study evaluated HRQoL among patients before and in the short-term following jaw resection as treatment for oral tumours using the University of Washington quality of life (UW-QoL) questionnaire. Forty participants were consecutively recruited over a period of 2 years, 70% of whom were female, 75% had mandibular lesions and half of them had ameloblastoma. Their mean age was 34.4 years. Participants returned high scores on most of the 12 disease-specific domains, suggesting a low level of dysfunction.

Saliva had reduced scores after surgery, with an increase in proportion of participants who reported it as an important issue. Mean scores for physical functions were lower than were for social-emotional functions. Surgical care had a positive impact on socio-emotional functions such as activity, mood and recreation, but with a negative impact on physical functions such as chewing, swallowing and saliva. Male patients as well as patients with benign and mandibular tumours returned higher scores when compared to female patients as well as patients with malignant and maxillary tumours respectively. This study revealed important changes in the HRQoL of patients with jaw tumors in Kenya, which ought to be considered during their care.","Introduction
HRQoL is a multidimensional assessment of how disease and its treatment affect a patient’s sense of overall function and wellbeing.1 Jaw tumours often necessitate partial or complete removal of jaw bones as treatment2 leading to functional impairment and reduced HRQoL. Even though this surgical treatment could save lives, it often leads to loss of tissues within the maxillofacial region,3,4 especially those involved in speech and swallowing such as the tongue, floor of mouth and jaws, all of which are important for functional integrity.5
Among factors that determine HRQoL following jaw resection are size, location and nature of the lesion, age and gender of the patient. Removal of large or malignant tumours often causes dysfunction that depend on the location and size of the tumour.6 Studies have shown that among patients with head and neck pathologies, women tend to have lower HRQoL scores compared to men and are more likely than men to develop depressive distress.7 Older patients are also known to suffer less from surgery-related distress when compared to younger patients.8
Clinicians in developing countries often view therapeutic success in terms of recurrence and survival rates with much less consideration of quality of life of patients.9 Consequently, there is limited effort in these countries to conduct studies that go beyond mortality and morbidity as indicators of good healthcare. Despite an increasing number of patients diagnosed with jaw tumours that require jaw resection, only a few studies have been conducted in developing countries regarding HRQoL after jaw resection. The aim of this study was to determine patients’ HRQoL before and in the short-term after jaw resection at a referral hospital in western Kenya.
Methodology
Collection of clinical data
The study was conducted at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in western Kenya following approval by the regional Institutional Research and Ethics Committee (number 0003966). Participants were adult patients scheduled for jaw resection following diagnosis of benign or malignant jaw neoplasms between September 2021 and September 2023. Post surgery maxillary defects based on Cordeiro classification10 were all managed by regional soft tissue and osteocutaneous free flaps followed by obturation where none had undergone refashioning by the time of assessment. All patients were informed about the study, and signed written consent forms. Their sociodemographic information was collected using questionnaires with both open and closed ended questions, while clinical data were collected using a standardized data collection tool.
Assessment of HRQoL
We used the University of Washington Quality of life (UW-QoL) Questionnaire, Version 4, a self-administered questionnaire that provides a broad measure of HRQoL parameters, with domains that are specific to the head and neck region.11,12 This tool has been validated across many parts of the world with good reliability, acceptability and responsiveness.13 It consists of 15 questions. Twelve of them are about disease specific domains having between 3 and 6 response options that are scaled evenly from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) according to the hierarchy of the response. The domains are pain, appearance, activity, recreation, swallowing, chewing, speech, shoulder, taste, saliva, mood, and anxiety. Additionally, the tool has 3 general items that measure global HRQoL. Patients are also asked to choose up to three of the 12 disease-specific domains that were most important to them in the preceding 7 days.13 For this study, the UW-QoL Questionnaire was modified by replacing the word ‘cancer’ with ‘jaw surgery/resection’. We assessed the HRQoL twice for each participant; before treatment and during the first review visit after treatment.
Statistical analysis
Analysis was based on guidelines for handling data collected using the UW-QoL questionaire.14,15 Categorical variables were reported as frequency and percentages. Continuous data were evaluated for normal distribution and reported as either mean and standard deviation, mean and standard error or median and interquartile range, based on results of a normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk). Data from different groups were compared using the independent samples t-test or Mann– Whitney U test. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 29.0.2.20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A two-tailed value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Sociodemographic findings
A total of 42 patients were consented to participate in this study. Two patients provided incomplete information and were excluded from the analysis. The mean age of participants was 34.4 years, ranging from 18 to 83 years. Most patients (70%) were female, with 75% of them presenting with mandibular lesions and just over half of them diagnosed with ameloblastoma. (Table 1) Tumour sizes were on average 10.6 cm, (ranging from 5 to 27 cm). The questionnaire was first administered on overage 18.3 hours before surgery, and the second interview was conducted upon the first review visit that occurred on overage 23.4 days (SD 12.6) ranging from 7 to 67 days after surgery.

Domain scores
Participants returned high scores on the 12 disease-specific domains of the UW-QoL questionnaires. Before surgery, all domains had average scores of over 60% except chewing (40%) and appearance (57%). (Table 2) Domains that had the lowest percent of best score (of 100%) were appearance (5%) and chewing (18%). After surgery, chewing still recorded the lowest average score and the lowest percent of best score. This was followed by saliva. The mean score for appearance increased from 57% before surgery to 66% after surgery (p= 0.036) whereas mean score for saliva reduced from 75% to 45% (p= 0.002) respectively.

Participants selected appearance as the most important domain issue before surgery (29%) as well as after surgery (21%). This was followed by pain (18%) and anxiety (16%) before surgery, and by pain (19%) and chewing (17%) after surgery. The least selected domain issue in terms of importance was shoulder (0) in both cases. (Table 3)

Significant problem
We determined the proportion of participants who reported various domain issues as being ‘significant problem.’ Most domains showed improvement following surgery, with fewer patients reporting these as significant problems. (Table 4) However, there was an increase in the percentage of patients who reported saliva as a significant problem (from 22% to 58%), with the proportion of participants with best score dropping from 70% to 31%. Other domains that showed an increase in the proportion of participants who reported them as significant problems after surgery included swallowing, chewing and speech. (Table 4)

Composite scores
We computed a composite score known as ‘physical function’ being a simple average of 6 domain scores namely; chewing, swallowing, speech, taste, saliva and appearance. The mean score for physical function was significantly lower after surgery (63) when compared to what it was before surgery (73) (p = 0.001). Before surgery, patients with malignant tumours had a median score of 67 and a mean score of 63 compared to a median score of 79 and a mean score of 75 among those with benign tumours. Male patients had a somewhat higher median score of 83 before surgery compared to a median score of 70 among female patients. Participants with maxillary defects had a higher mean score (76) for physical function when compared to patients with mandibular tumors (66).
We also had a composite score known as ‘social-emotional function’ being a simple average of 6 domain scores namely; anxiety, mood, pain, activity, recreation and shoulder function. The median score for the socio-emotional function before surgery was 78, which increased to 83 after surgery. The median score for socio-emotional function before surgery among patients with mandibular lesions was 78, and increased to 86 after surgery. The mean score increased significantly from 73 before surgery to 80, (p= (.026) after surgery. (Table 5)

Discussion
This study assessed the HRQoL of patients treated for jaw tumours before and after surgery care in western Kenya. Assessment in the short-term after surgery was informed by our observation that our patients almost always come back for the first review that occurs approximately one month after surgery, but rarely come for additional reviews unless they experience complications or require rehabilitative care. To reduce sampling bias, we consecutively sampled all eligible participants over a period of two years. The numbers and epidemiological profile of participants in this study are comparable to those in studies done previously.16–19 A recent review of literature showed that there is a wide variation in the way outcomes of the UW-QoL questionnaire are reported, making it difficult to compare data from different studies.20
We found a low level of dysfunction among patients treated for jaw tumours, which is similar to findings in other studies.13,17,21 Shoulder, speech and taste returned some of the best domain scores, whereas chewing and appearance returned the lowest domain scores.9,22,23 Patients with benign tumours such as ameloblastoma often present when only tumours become too large, affecting functions such as appearance, swallowing and chewing. A recent systematic review revealed that the function of chewing is often the worst affected by extensive surgery affecting the jaws, particularly in the absence of adequate rehabilitative care.2,24 In another review that looked at studies conducted using the UW-QoL, chewing scores had a wide range of between 31.9 and 97.4, 20 with chewing ability affected for a period of up to one year following surgery.
Similar to other studies,9 our study found appearance to be the most important domain before surgery as well as after surgery, suggesting a key negative impact of slow growing but disfiguring facial tumours on the HRQoL of patients in our set up. In our opinion, the improvement in the median scores for appearance after surgery can be attributed to the fact that patients who present with large benign tumours experience immediate improvement in facial appearance after surgery. Efforts to improve public awareness about jaw tumours to enhance early detection and reducing waiting times for surgery are therefore likely to improve HRQoL.
Saliva was impacted negatively after surgery, with a reduction in its score as well as an increase in proportion of participants who reported it as an important issue after surgery. This is contrary to many studies,21 including studies in Africa,9,23 where saliva was shown to maintain high domain scores and low importance scores both before and after surgery. This does appear to be a unique finding in our set up. It is however plausible that jaw surgery could damage salivary glands causing drooling which might affect patients’ HRQoL after surgery.
Aggregation of UW-QoL domain scores into composite scores has not been explored widely in previous studies, making it difficult to make comparisons. In this study, median and mean scores for physical function were lower than the median and mean scores for social-emotional function. Most patients in our study had disfiguring benign tumours that likely affected physical functions such as appearance, chewing and swallowing without much effect on socio-emotional functions such as pain and recreation. Surgical care had an immediate positive impact on socio-emotional functions such as activity, mood and recreation, but with a negative impact on physical functions such as chewing, swallowing and saliva. It would be good to investigate how these scores change in the long-term after surgery. It has, however, been suggested that patients become more adaptive,23 and the scores are likely to get better in the long-term.
Participants with malignant tumours recorded lower median and mean scores for both physical function and social-emotional function when compared to scores for those with benign tumours. These scores dropped further after surgery, suggesting a general reduction in HRQoL for patients with malignant tumours in the immediate aftermath of surgery. As reported in other studies, the site of the lesion could determine the HRQoL of a patient both before and after surgery.6,13,16 Resection of sections of the maxilla generally had a bigger impact on the HRQoL of patients compared to resection of the mandible. The maxilla is a key structure in the midface, with a role in facial appearance, chewing and speech.25 Rehabilitation of maxillary defects is also more difficult compared to rehabilitation of mandibular defects.26
In this study, men had higher median and mean scores for physical function than women, both before and after surgery. This difference was however not determined for social-emotional function. This finding agrees with previous studies where women reported higher concern about their physical functions such as appearance and less concern about socio-emotional functions such as pain when compared to men.16,22,27
Conclusion
This study revealed a low level of dysfunction among patients presenting with jaw tumours in western Kenya. It also highlights the previously undocumented impact of large disfiguring jaw lesions on physical functions such as chewing and swallowing and on patient’s HRQoL before and after treatment, particularly the challenge with saliva control in the short-term after surgery.
Limitations
This study assessed HRQoL in the short-term after surgery because our patients rarely come for long-term follow-up unless they experience complications or require rehabilitative care. A review in the long-term would be preferable.

Conflict of Interest
The authors have no competing interest to declare.","This study evaluated the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients undergoing jaw resection for tumors at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in western Kenya. HRQoL, a multidimensional construct reflecting how disease and treatment affect overall function and wellbeing, was assessed using a modified version of the University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QoL) Questionnaire, Version 4. The questionnaire, tailored to focus on jaw surgery rather than cancer, measured 12 disease-specific domains (including pain, appearance, activity, recreation, swallowing, chewing, speech, shoulder, taste, saliva, mood, and anxiety) alongside three global items.

Data were collected from 40 adult patients (mean age 34.4 years, 70% female) diagnosed with benign or malignant jaw neoplasms between September 2021 and September 2023. Participants completed the UW-QoL assessment before surgery and again at a first review visit (averaging 23.4 days postoperatively). Preoperatively, most domain scores were above 60%, except for chewing (40%) and appearance (57%). Postoperative results revealed an improvement in appearance (increasing from 57% to 66%) and socio-emotional function, yet significant declines were noted in physical functions—particularly chewing, swallowing, and saliva control (saliva scores dropped from 75% to 45%). Composite scores further indicated that patients with malignant tumors and maxillary defects experienced lower physical and social-emotional outcomes compared to those with benign lesions or mandibular involvement.

The study concludes that while overall dysfunction was low, jaw resection notably impairs specific physical functions. It underscores the need for early detection, improved rehabilitative care, and further long-term research to better understand HRQoL outcomes following such surgeries.","This study, conducted at a Kenyan referral hospital, examined the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of patients undergoing jaw resection for tumors. Using the University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QoL) questionnaire, HRQoL was assessed before and shortly after surgery. The study involved 40 patients, predominantly female, with a range of benign and malignant jaw neoplasms. Results showed that while domains like speech and taste scored high, chewing and appearance were consistently low. Post-surgery, saliva control was significantly worsened. Appearance was identified as the most important domain for patients both before and after surgery, with a noted improvement in median scores for appearance after surgery. Physical function decreased post-surgery, while socio-emotional function improved slightly. Malignant tumors and maxillary resections had a greater negative impact on HRQoL. The study concludes that jaw tumors significantly impact physical functions and overall HRQoL, particularly regarding chewing, swallowing, and saliva control, highlighting the need for interventions addressing these challenges. The study was limited by its short-term follow-up.","This study evaluates the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients undergoing jaw resection for benign or malignant tumours at a referral hospital in western Kenya.

Tagdiwala2024,How can we raise awareness and educate medical undergraduate students about OMFS?,"Tagdiwala, Parth Ankur",2024,British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,10.1016/j.bjoms.2023.10.017,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2023.10.017,"In recent years there has been a rise in medicine-first graduates pursuing a career within OMFS, yet many studies report that undergraduate medical students lack sufficient knowledge about the specialty. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that online methods of delivering undergraduate education are successful. We organised an online conference that comprised six lectures covering common clinical problems that OMF surgeons encounter, and the academic pathway. Delegates were asked to complete an optional pre/post-conference survey which aimed to assess students? interest in the specialty and their attitudes to online conferences. Participants were invited to undertake a semi-structured interview about their attitudes towards the use of online conferences and their ideas about how to interest students further. The interview was thematically analysed. The pre-conference and post-conference questionnaires were answered by 21 and 22 participants, respectively. The demographic consisted largely of undergraduate medical students. Most participants reported increased interest in the specialty after the conference. The interest of delegates wanting to follow an academic pathway decreased. Fewer delegates after the conference believed that online conferences could replace in-person conferences. Five participants undertook a semi-structured interview. Key themes identified were: a lack of exposure drives a lack of interest in OMFS, a desire to learn more about the specialty, and in-person conferences provide more opportunities for delegates. Online conferences can be used to increase student interest in OMFS, but students value in-person conferences more. Students are keen to learn more about the specialty.","Introduction
Historically, oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMFS) tended to have obtained a dental degree before succeeding to a medical degree. However, in recent years a rising number of medicine-first degree holders are choosing to pursue OMFS.1–3 Previous literature has shown that medical students are keen to learn more about, and gain further exposure to, the specialty.2–4 It is therefore essential to understand how we can design effective resources to increase awareness.
The COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in educators adopting online teaching methods which were generally well received by undergraduate medical students. Students praised the flexibility that online teaching provided, and the content quality was considered equivalent to that of in-person teaching. We designed a one-day online conference that aimed to improve awareness of, and interest in, OMFS and its associated subspecialties.
Our primary aims were to find out if an online conference could increase medical students’ interest in OMFS, find out if medical students would prefer an online or in-person conference, and understand how we can increase awareness of, and interest in, the specialty.
Method
We collaborated with local post-CCT OMF surgeons and a fully qualified dentist to design and deliver six lecture sessions and a competition that showcased undergraduate/recently graduated medical/dental research. The event took place on one day and was CPD accredited by the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS). Three lecture sessions, all delivered by post-certificate of completion of training (CCT) OMF surgeons, focused on managing and examining trauma in an OMFS setting. One session that educated students on the academic pathways available within OMFS was delivered by a post-CCT associate OMFS professor. One session on common dental conditions was delivered by a fully qualified dentist, and one session on the management and treatment of malignant/premalignant lesions in the oral cavity was delivered by a post-CCT OMF surgeon. All sessions took place online using Zoom. Registration forms for the conference were circulated amongst all major national undergraduate surgical societies and advertised to students on social media.
Delegates who attended the conference were asked to complete optional pre-conference and post-conference surveys. The questions and response options can be viewed in Tables 1 and 2. Students were also asked to complete mandatory registration forms before and after the conference to issue CPD accredited certificates.

The surveys also asked the delegates to leave their contact details if they wished to be contacted for further studies. After the conference we emailed all those who had expressed an interest and asked them to participate in a semi-structured interview. Interviews were conducted by the author on Zoom and recorded. Zoom in-built software was used to transcribe the audio. All audio recordings and transcripts were stored in a secure OneDrive (Microsoft) folder. The transcript was reviewed by the author and compared to the audio recording for inconsistencies. Following transcription, the author analysed the interviews using the thematic analysis guidelines set out by Braun and Clarke.5
Results
Questionnaire results
The mandatory registration forms recorded the presence of 35 delegates at the start of the event. After the event ended 22 remained. Twenty-one responded to the pre-conference optional questionnaire and 20 to the post-conference optional questionnaire. The majority of the delegates were undergraduate medical students. This trend was reflected in the responses on the questionnaires.
Prior to the conference 61.9% of all participants reported being interested in OMFS (≥4 score) and after the conference 75% of all participants reported being interested (≥4 score). Before the conference 90.4% of delegates reported having an interest in trauma surgery (≥4 score) and after the conference 85% (≥4 score) reported an interest. Prior to the conference 71.1% of attendees reported an interest in pursuing an academic surgery pathway (≥4 score), but after the conference 60% reported an interest (≥4 score). Interestingly, only 43.9% of participants had been aware of the academic pathway in OMFS (≥4 score) before the conference, and afterwards 63.2% reported being aware (≥4 score). Before the conference 63.1% (≥4 score) believed online conferences could replace in-person conferences. After the conference 55% (≥4 score) believed this was the case. Only 55% of delegates found online conferences enjoyable (≥4 score), whereas 90% found in-person conferences enjoyable (≥4 score). Both before and after the conference, delegates were generally willing to pay more to attend an in-person conference. Full results are available in Supplementary Figure 1.
Semi-structured interview thematic analysis
Prior to the conference 12 delegates volunteered to be contacted for subsequent research. Twenty volunteered after the conference. On follow up, five delegates agreed to participate in the semi-structured interview. All five were medical students who had not undertaken a dental degree. Four were in their third year of a six-year UK medical programme and one was a final-year medical student from Ukraine. Following the interview and thematic analysis we identified three key themes: lack of exposure drives a lack of interest in OMFS; desire to learn further about the specialty through further educational content and mentorships; and in-person conferences provide more opportunities for delegates.
Theme 1. Lack of exposure drives a lack of interest in OMFS
Many delegates mentioned that they were not interested in pursuing OMFS and the research opportunities within the specialty. Many mentioned that they had had little exposure to the specialty before the conference, and some also mentioned that they were unsure about the difference between OMFS and dentistry.
Participant 1: “I actually don't know too much about what the specialty actually involves. I see it’s very related to dentistry.”
Participant 3: “I wasn't particularly interested in the field. I thought it was quite niche, and I thought it was something that was reserved for dentists. ”
Most participants were also uninterested in the research opportunities present in the OMFS pathway, which they stated was due to a lack of experience and support. Interestingly, most appreciated the importance and value of research despite their lack of interest. Furthermore, some mentioned that they were keen to learn more about the academic pathway but were unaware of how to pursue it, and this frustrated them.
Participant 2: “I haven’t really thought about the academic pathway.”
Participant 3: “I don’t particularly have a good understanding of the process behind OMFS research……………. But yes, I do recognise the value that research brings……it's quite excessive and inaccessible as in where do I go? Who do I talk to? What sort of things do I have to do to make my application stand out?”
Participant 1: (on the academic surgical pathway) “not only do you have your common knowledge. You also know how the specialty is going to develop and stuff. And also it feels nice to contribute to this area”
Overall, it was clear from the discussions with participants that they were unsure about how to explore the specialty and this led to students failing to develop an interest in the field.
Theme 2. Desire to learn more about the specialty through further educational content and mentorships
Many participants were keen to learn more about the specialty and attributed the online conference to their new-found interest. They would like to have access to educational content such as online webinars and workshops to further explore the specialty. Some also stated that they would like such content to be integrated into the medical school curriculum during earlier years so they could expose themselves further to the field.
Interestingly, many participants mentioned that a good way to increase awareness of the specialty would be to provide mentoring with people currently in the OMFS field. Participants mentioned that learning from people 1-1 is valuable. It would allow them to understand more about the specialty and establish contacts that they could rely on in the future for opportunities.
Participant 4: “I think it's quite nice to be able to, you know, sit down with people from multiple disciplines, speak with them regarding the, you know, career paths.”
Participant 5: “Like involvement of the students for observations I believe, like you know what you observe is like long, long retaining in your brain rather than, you know, cramming things. I think professors or surgeons should involve, like, a medical student, you know, if they are performing any lab techniques, or anything, like they should be allowed to observe things.”
Theme 3. In-person conferences provide more opportunities for delegates
Participants appreciated that online conferences were a good method of learning more about the specialty. They particularly praised the geographical freedom they provide. However, they all valued in-person conferences far more than online conferences. Many attributed this to the lack of interactive opportunities that online conferences provide. They believed that human interaction and mentoring were valuable parts of the attending experience; it helped them to focus on and appreciate the content of the lectures. Furthermore, the lack of available practical skill lessons at online conferences further reduced interactivity.
Interviewer: “Do you find in-person conferences enjoyable?”
Participant 2: “Yeah, I do find them enjoyable as well because, like I said, you get the other side. Maybe you don't learn as much but you get to actually try stuff like you know, like skills. I think it's very good you also like get to connect with other people.”
Interviewer: “Do you find online conferences enjoyable?”
Participant 3: “I would say I wouldn't find it particularly engaging. I think it's very, very easy actually to get distracted.”
Interviewer: “But how about in-person conferences? Would you say you find them enjoyable?”
Participant 3: “I would say definitely more enjoyable than the former, mainly because interactivity online really has no comparison with human interaction in real life.”
Discussion
A scoping review published in BJOMS demonstrated medical students’ lack of awareness of the specialty,4 and subsequent studies have supported this conclusion.2,3 To increase awareness of the specialty, Zargan et al used simulations to train medical students to learn OMFS techniques.6 Online learning methods have also been utilised, and Bock et al, who used pre-recorded lectures in a flipped classroom setting, reported an increase in student knowledge.7 However, we know of no paper that has reported use of an online conference to increase awareness of OMFS. Unlike in-person initiatives, online conferences allow educational content to be distributed regardless of geographical limitations, while maintaining audience participation and cost effectiveness.
Lectures were designed to enhance medical students’ knowledge of key areas of the OMFS curriculum that they reported the least knowledge on. For example, lectures on oral cancer were developed because Hamid et al reported a lack of awareness in medical students about how to have manage oral cancers.8
The high proportion of responses from delegates gave us an accurate representation of the general viewpoint. Our study shows that online conferences can increase medical students’ interest in the specialty, with participants reporting that they were more interested in OMFS after the conference. During the semi-structured interviews participants mentioned that the online conference was their first ever exposure to the specialty and they were keen to learn more.
Unfortunately there was a small decrease in the number of delegates who were interested in the trauma aspect of OMF surgery. However, due to the small sample size and small difference this cannot be considered a significant difference.
Despite the decrease in participants’ interest in pursuing an academic pathway, there was an increase in awareness of the pathway, showing that we successfully educated delegates about the different training routes. Moreover, during interviews the participants mentioned that the online conference was their first experience of learning about the academic pathway.
There was a small decrease in the number of delegates who believed online conferences could replace in-person conferences after the event, which was interesting to note. Both before and after the conference delegates preferred in-person conferences, and this was further supported by answers during semi-structured interviews and by the large difference in monetary value that participants placed on both types of conference.
It is clear that an online conference is a successful method of increasing awareness of the specialty, however, an in-person conference would be far superior. Events should focus on providing mentorship and the opportunity to form meaningful connections with people within the field, a finding that is echoed in similar studies.3,9 Moreover, medical students value learning practical skills. These findings should be considered when designing resources to raise awareness of the specialty.
Our thematic analysis shows that to increase interest, medical students would like increased exposure to the specialty within the medical curriculum and would like to clarify the role dentistry plays in the field, a finding consistent with other studies.2,3 The interplay between medicine and dentistry is also misunderstood globally whereby many countries regard OMF surgeons as only dentally qualified.10 This global confusion about the specialty further adds to the difficulties medical students may experience when deciding if OMFS is the right career choice for them.10
Conclusion
Online conferences successfully improve undergraduate medical students’ interest in OMFS. Future events should feature interactive and mentorship opportunities to captivate their interest in the field.

Recently, however, increasing numbers of medicine-first graduates are exploring OMFS, highlighting the need for enhanced exposure and educational resources. In response, an online conference was developed to boost awareness and interest among undergraduate medical students.

The one-day event, conducted via Zoom, comprised six lecture sessions and a research competition. Lectures were delivered by post-certificate of completion of training (CCT) OMFS surgeons, an associate OMFS professor, and a fully qualified dentist. Key topics included trauma management, academic pathways in OMFS, dental conditions, and the treatment of malignant or premalignant oral lesions. The conference was CPD accredited by the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS) and promoted through national undergraduate surgical societies and social media.

Pre- and post-conference surveys were administered to assess participants’ interests and perceptions. Results showed an increase in overall interest in OMFS (from 61.9% to 75% of delegates scoring 4 or above on a 5-point scale) and a marked improvement in awareness of the academic pathway (from 43.9% to 63.2%). Although interest in trauma surgery and academic pathways experienced slight decreases, these changes were not considered significant. Semi-structured interviews revealed three themes: insufficient prior exposure reducing interest, a desire for more educational content and mentorship, and a preference for in-person conferences due to better interactivity and networking opportunities.

In conclusion, while online conferences effectively raise awareness of OMFS, future events should incorporate interactive elements and mentorship to engage students.","This research paper investigates the effectiveness of an online conference in increasing medical students' interest in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS). Historically, OMFS was dominated by dentists obtaining medical degrees, but more medical graduates are now pursuing this specialty.

The study involved a one-day online conference featuring lectures by OMFS surgeons and a dentist, covering topics like trauma management, academic pathways, and dental conditions. Pre- and post-conference surveys assessed interest in OMFS, trauma surgery, academic pathways, awareness of the OMFS academic route, and opinions on online versus in-person conferences. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted.

Results showed an increase in overall interest in OMFS after the conference. While awareness of the academic pathway improved, interest in pursuing it decreased slightly. Thematic analysis of interviews highlighted that lack of exposure to OMFS contributes to low interest, students desire more educational content and mentorship, and in-person conferences offer superior interactive opportunities.

The study concludes that online conferences can effectively increase medical students' interest in OMFS. However, integrating interactive elements and mentorship opportunities into future events is recommended to further enhance engagement and address misunderstandings about the specialty.","This study explores the effectiveness of an online conference in increasing medical students' awareness and interest in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS), a specialty often misunderstood and under-exposed in medical education.

Leow2024,How good is good enough? Lessons learned from review of outcomes of 50 patients following extraoral open reduction and internal fixation of condylar neck and base fractures at a regional major trauma centre,"Leow, Julian; Exley, Rebecca; Holmes, Simon; Bhatti, Nabeel",2024,British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,10.1016/j.bjoms.2023.11.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2023.11.004,"The management of mandibular fractures is routine owing to their frequency, particularly those of the mandibular condyle, which are invariably common. Notwithstanding disparities in the literature, the international consensus towards which fractures of the mandibular condyle benefit from open surgical intervention is almost universally accepted. Closed reduction or non-operative management may be utilised in certain circumstances. Whilst outcome research has addressed complications with respect to operative side effects, outcomes related to the quality of bone repair and the setting in which this is delivered have not been universally addressed. The aim of this study was to determine the predictability of translating an indicated operative treatment plan into an acceptable functional result. We evaluated the outcomes of 59 extracapsular condylar fractures in 50 patients who were treated by extraoral open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) between March 2021 and August 2022. We reviewed demographic data, surgical approach, and plating strategy, and critically evaluated the clinical and radiological outcomes. Whilst we found that the quality of reduction was not universally perfect, the majority were within tolerance, which we set according to the Strasbourg Osteosynthesis Research Group (SORG) definition for minimal displacement (<2¬†mm overlap and 10¬∞ angulation). The cohort had good functional occlusion and minimal long-term postoperative complications. Two patients required re-operation for non-union, and we discuss causality in these cases. In conclusion, we found that ORIF of condylar neck and base fractures is predictable in real-time surgical practice with respect to functional outcome. However, if imperfectly reduced, there is a small risk of non-union.","Introduction
There is increasing evidence from clinical research studies and international consensus that the standard of care for displaced and angulated condylar neck and base fractures is open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).1,2 Symptomatic and functional improvement with respect to interincisal opening, movement, pain, and malocclusion have been observed. Traditional closed reduction, whilst avoiding injury to the facial nerve and external scarring, is less favoured as techniques have evolved.3
The seminal paper that established an accepted threshold for open reduction demonstrated an advantage for ORIF in cases with 2 mm overlap and 10° angulation.4 Whilst surgeons can be more confident of both the indications and surgical approach, we know of little written about the quality of reduction and resultant functional outcome in ORIF of condylar neck and base fractures. The aim of this study therefore was to find out if our practice allows for the translation of the treatment plan into an acceptable radiological and functional outcome.
In keeping with modern surgical practice, the operative procedures were performed by oral and maxillofacial (OMF) surgeons with varying experience. Complex cases were managed by subspecialist trauma OMF surgeons.
Patients and methods
We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with condylar neck and base fractures who were treated by ORIF at our unit between March 2021 and August 2022. The study was registered with the audit department and no identifiable patient information was recorded. Patients were identified from theatre lists and the weekly trauma multidisciplinary (MDT) meeting, and entered on to a secure centralised Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
Classification system
We used the standard classification for condylar fracture by Loukota et al, which we find highly predictive of operative difficulty.5 Fractures of the condylar neck and base were subclassified according to the revised Strasbourg Osteosynthesis Research Group (SORG) criterion: the one-third to two-thirds rule with reference to the proportion of the fracture line above and below the level of the sigmoid notch.
Data collection
The following parameters were recorded: age, time of fracture, medical and surgical history, smoking, and alcohol consumption. With respect to management, the type of fracture, associated maxillofacial injuries, approach, and plating strategy, were recorded.
Treatment indication
The operative indication was an overlap of more than 2 mm or angulation of 10° of the condyle.4 All patients were reviewed at a dedicated trauma MDT irrespective of operating surgeon.
Evaluation and outcomes
The primary outcome measure was radiological accuracy which was independently reviewed on a Sectra PACS (Sectra Ltd) workstation by two surgeons for degree of residual shortening and angulation. The outcome tolerance defined a good outcome as <2 mm overlap and <10° angulation of the condyle. We defined suboptimal outcome as >2 mm overlap and or >10° angulation.
We recorded functional outcomes related to the surgical approach and fixation: trismus, use of TheraBite® (Atos Medical), facial nerve injury, Frey syndrome, sialocele, requirement for botulinum toxin, and malocclusion.
Follow up
In keeping with our standard operating procedure, outcomes were reviewed at standardised intervals at our MDT clinic by OMF, psychology, and restorative and periodontology clinicians. All complications were recorded contemporaneously.
Results
Demographic data
This study identified 50 patients with a median (range) age of 38 (15-69) years. A total of 55 condyles were managed operatively and four needed revision surgery. Three patients were aged between 61 and 70, six between 51 and 60, eight between 41 and 50, 12 between 31 and 40, 19 between 21 and 30, and two between 11 and 20, with the youngest being 15 years old. Of the 50 patients, 40 were male and 10 female. Eighteen were American Society of Anesthesiologists grade (ASA) I and 32 were grade II. Sixteen smoked. The commonest aetiology was interpersonal violence (20/50 patients) followed by a fall from standing (15/50). Five patients had been involved in a road traffic accident, five had fallen off a bicycle, two had fallen off an escooter/eskateboard, two had jumped from a height, and one had a sports injury.
Fracture location
A total of 14/50 patients had isolated condylar fractures, 16 had condylar and parasymphysis fractures, five had condylar and body fractures, five had guardsman fractures, five had panfacial fractures, and five had condylar fractures with other concomitant fractures. The majority (48/59 condyles) were condylar base fractures, with the remaining condyles having neck fractures.
Surgical approach
The incision was transcutaneous in all patients. Thirty of 59 exposures were retromandibular anteroparotid, 19 were retromandibular transparotid, one was coronal retromandibular, four were other sites, and five were not recorded.
All patients were managed postoperatively with mobilisation except for five who had intermaxillary fixation (IMF).
Of the 59 condyles, the commonest plating strategy was a four-hole miniplate posteriorly and two-hole miniplate anteriorly (38/59), followed by a trapezoid plate (8/59). (Table 1)

Clinical outcomes
Primary revision rate (1 of 59 condyles)
Case 1 was a 33-year-old male with a condylar base fracture, who was fit and well. The complexity of the fracture was incompletely appreciated on computed tomography (CT) and perioperatively, an undisplaced high ramus fracture was mistaken for the displaced condylar base fracture. He underwent subsequent ORIF of the condylar base fracture (see Clinical pearls section for radiological detail) (Fig. 3).
Secondary revision rate (2 of 59 condyles)
Case 2 was a 64-year-old female with stage II non-Hodgkin lymphoma who underwent ORIF of a condylar neck fracture with suboptimal ORIF utilising a trapezoidal plate with a screw in the line of the fracture. She had a sialocele that was managed with aspiration and botulinum toxin. She required re-ORIF and a bone graft (see Clinical pearls section).
Case 3 was a 45-year-old female current smoker with malnourishment. She underwent ORIF of a condylar base fracture with a four-hole posterior plate and two-hole anterior plate with good reduction. Subsequent fixation failure and non-union were attributed to secondary trauma complicated by medical factors, and she required re-ORIF and a bone graft.
Complications
Complications are detailed in Table 2. In our series, no patients experienced permanent facial nerve weakness. Two had a minimal lateral open bite that resolved, and one had a class 3 malocclusion that was likely to have been pre-existing.

Radiological outcomes
Postoperative reduction was independently scored by two OMFS surgeons with reference to reduction and angulation, as defined by the SORG criteria. Postoperatively 49/59 condyles had <2 mm overlap, and 52/59 had <10° angulation. Additionally, anterior and posterior radiological reduction was scored and a tolerance of 2 mm set. Postoperatively 44/59 condyles had <2 mm anterior reduction and 56/59 had <2 mm posterior reduction.
Four patients had combined poor anterior and posterior reduction, two of whom had trapezoid plates (one had two plates and one had lag screws).
Discussion
There is little doubt that there has been an evolution in surgical management following numerous low powered case series6,7 and opinion papers,8–10 augmented by a meta-analysis11 and international consensus meetings.12 The relative lag in this surgical revolution is due to the acceptability of IMF as a low-risk procedure that can be enacted by junior staff with an adequate outcome. The technically challenging open reduction, which Ellis et al refers to as ‘lush with anatomical hazards’, requires an experienced surgeon with a steep learning curve, but has definable advantages with regard to function and appearance postoperatively.13 Over the course of time these advantages are becoming accepted and surgical morbidity is acceptable. Should the fracture be fixed anatomically, the use of IMF should be questioned.
In fractures affecting the dentate portion of the mandible, the same question arises, although Christensen et al highlighted the fact that a short period of IMF could potentially reduce the risk of surgical site infection in fractures of the mandibular angle.14 The case for IMF in the plated condyle remains to be justified. Our case series represents a transparent review of objective outcomes achieved by surgeons of differing experience who employed a variety of techniques, all evidence based and practised routinely. We believe that this reflects pragmatic practice in a modern trauma centre. All ultimate outcomes were satisfactory, although reflective analysis has demonstrated some key learning points.
The commonest surgical approach was retromandibular, both transparotid and anteroparotid, each with minimal temporary complication (four cases each of temporary mild weakness that resolved in two months). The two sialoceles were managed conservatively and resolved in four weeks. The anteroparotid approach has the advantage of reducing sialocele formation, but is difficult to achieve in patients with alcoholic sialosis,15 whilst the transparotid approach enables relative protection of the nerve within the parotid gland.6,16
Osteosynthesis was achieved by different plating strategies, a two-plate (spaced four-hole, and spaced two-hole) versus a trapezoid plate primarily, or a mixed technique for more abstract fracture patterns. The use of IMF was unusual in the series (n = 5). Indications were additional complex fractures in the dentate mandible (n = 1), the need to support wound healing (n = 1), the need to encourage maximum intercuspation (n = 1), and for reassurance (n = 2).
Reduction was largely satisfactory. There was good alignment of bony fragments with 49/59 cases remaining with less than 2 mm shortening (59/59 within 5 mm) and 52/59 with less than 10° angulation. This produced a satisfactory occlusal outcome in all but two cases.
Medium-term complications included two non-unions, one due to surgical error following the application of a trapezoid plate with one screw in the fracture line, the second attributed to heavy bruxism. Both required re-operation. For this reason, the authors advocate the use of cone-beam CT (CBCT) with a small field of view to evaluate postsurgical reduction.
The concept of medium to long-term change was introduced by Ellis et al13 who reported that 10%–20% of plated fractures developed a worsening final position by six months postoperatively without functional discrepancy. The authors commented that miniplates should be avoided if active mobilisation of the mandible is required because a certain number will fracture. In their series of 61 cases they noted two cases of plate bending and three loose screws, so hardware predictability remains unproven.13 With respect to postoperative IMF, the precise definition is open to interpretation; elastic guidance was used to support those with an imperfect occlusion. In a refreshing series, Nys et al,17 who compared conservative management (IMF versus IMF with open reduction), found malocclusion in 24% of cases, and secondary surgery was required in 25% of cases. Whilst there was likely to have been selection bias, the group found that bilateral cases were more likely to suffer occlusal discrepancy. This supports the conclusions of the conference at Groningen which considered unilateral condylar fractures separately.12 Our results do not support the need for routine postoperative IMF for the majority of condylar fractures, and it is reserved to control malunion in the event of inadequate reduction, or when open reduction is not offered.
Clinical pearls
CT-based imaging allows for accurate assessment of the position of the condylar minor fragment, the presence of secondary fractures, and the nature of the fracture site itself. It is important to place screws either side of the fracture where the buccal and lingual cortices are present. In fractures of a sagittal nature, the screw may distract the fracture.
Imaging
Prior to surgery it is important to appreciate the 3-dimensional (3D) anatomy. This allows for appropriate planning, and the assessment of comminution, angulation, displacement, and oblique fractures, which may not be evident on radiographs.18
Lingual flange evaluation
Oblique fracture patterns result in a lingual flange that cannot be appreciated on plain film radiography. In such situations, CT permits operative planning and the authors advocate a four-hole spaced and two-hole anterior plating strategy to avoid a screw in the line of the fracture. Postopertive reduction is well visualised using small-field-of-view CBCT (Fig. 1).

Surgical technique- traction screw
Due to muscle pull, access, and fracture pattern, it can sometimes be difficult to reduce condylar fractures adequately. For these cases we use a traction screw and a transcutaneously-placed 0.5 mm stainless steel wire (via a large cannula) to aid intraoperative reduction and establish the posterior height (Fig. 2).

Complications following ORIF: suboptimal cases
Revision case 1 – primary revision required
This case highlights the difficulty of this procedure and failure to appreciate the surgical anatomy (Fig. 3). The patient had malocclusion and required re-ORIF. This may have been avoided with judicious review of the preoperative CT scans in all planes, and intraoperatively if the superior part of the fracture had been visualised.

Revision case 2 – secondary revision required
In this case of non-union, a trapezoidal plate was used, and causality was attributed to screw placement into the fracture and insufficient reduction.
Revision case 3 – secondary revision required
In the second case of non-union, a two-hole anterior miniplate and four-hole posterior miniplate were used and an ideal radiological result was achieved. Failure was attributed to secondary trauma complicated by heavy bruxism.
Learning points
•        
Condylar ORIF is a difficult procedure that requires appreciation of the anatomy, but it can be done with adequate training, ideally in a high-volume unit.
•        
In our series facial nerve weakness was temporary and the incidence was low.
•        
Re-ORIF is challenging due to constraints of existing screw holes, bony resorption, and scar tissue.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the challenges of condylar ORIF; it highlights potential pitfalls and proposes strategies to avoid them. In our high-volume specialist unit we have found it possible to translate treatment plans to acceptable functional results, and surgeons with a spectrum of operative experience have achieved outcomes of less than 2 mm overlap and 10° angulation. We advocate a posterior four-hole spaced plate and anterior two-hole plating strategy for better negotiation of the lingual flange and closure of the anterior diastasis. CT for preoperative planning is unmatched, and postoperative small-field-of-view CBCT permits critical evaluation of reduction. Operative intervention was associated with good functional occlusion and minimal long-term complications.

With increasing evidence favoring ORIF over traditional closed reduction, the procedure offers improvements in mandibular movement, pain reduction, and occlusal alignment while minimizing long-term complications.

Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on 50 patients treated between March 2021 and August 2022. Fractures were classified using the Loukota system and the revised Strasbourg Osteosynthesis Research Group (SORG) criterion, based on the proportion of the fracture line above and below the sigmoid notch. Patient demographics, fracture details, associated injuries, and medical histories were recorded. Surgical approaches were uniformly transcutaneous, predominantly via retromandibular anteroparotid and transparotid incisions. Various plating strategies were employed, with the most common being a combination of a four-hole posterior miniplate and a two-hole anterior miniplate. Radiological outcomes were measured in terms of residual overlap (<2 mm) and angulation (<10°), while functional outcomes included assessments of trismus, facial nerve status, and malocclusion.

Results: Out of 59 condyles managed, 49 exhibited less than 2 mm overlap and 52 had less than 10° angulation postoperatively. Complications were minimal, with transient facial nerve weakness, sialocele, and minor occlusal discrepancies observed, and only a few cases requiring revision surgery.

Conclusion: With thorough preoperative CT planning, precise screw placement, and appropriate plating strategies, ORIF achieves acceptable radiological and functional outcomes for condylar fractures, even when performed by surgeons with varying levels of experience. These compelling findings support modern surgical practice.","This retrospective study reviewed 50 patients (55 condyles) undergoing ORIF for condylar neck and base fractures between March 2021 and August 2022. The aim was to evaluate the radiological and functional outcomes of ORIF performed by surgeons with varying experience. Outcomes were assessed against established thresholds (<2mm overlap, <10° angulation).

The study found that 49/59 condyles achieved <2mm overlap, and 52/59 had <10° angulation postoperatively. While temporary complications like facial nerve weakness and sialoceles occurred, they resolved conservatively. There were three revision cases, one due to missed diagnosis, and two due to hardware failure linked to suboptimal plate placement or patient-related factors. The authors advocate pre-operative CT planning, a specific plating strategy (posterior four-hole, anterior two-hole), and post-operative CBCT evaluation to optimize outcomes. The study concludes that with appropriate planning and technique, acceptable functional outcomes and anatomical reductions can be achieved. They caution that condylar ORIF is a technically challenging procedure requiring expertise and highlight specific pitfalls.","This study evaluates the outcomes of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for condylar neck and base fractures, focusing on radiological accuracy and functional results. Conducted at a high-volume trauma center, the retrospective review included 50 patients (59 condyles) treated between March 2021 and August 2022. The primary outcome was radiological accuracy, defined as <2 mm overlap and <10° angulation postoperatively. Results showed that 49/59 condyles achieved <2 mm overlap, and 52/59 achieved <10° angulation, with satisfactory occlusal outcomes in most cases. Complications included temporary facial nerve weakness (4 cases), sialocele (2 cases), and non-union (2 cases), all managed successfully. The study highlights the technical challenges of ORIF, emphasizing the importance of preoperative CT imaging for accurate assessment and planning. A posterior four-hole and anterior two-hole plating strategy was recommended to address oblique fractures and avoid screw placement in the fracture line. The use of postoperative intermaxillary fixation (IMF) was limited and reserved for specific cases. The study concludes that ORIF, when performed by experienced surgeons, yields acceptable functional and radiological outcomes, with minimal long-term complications. Key learning points include the necessity of detailed preoperative imaging, careful surgical technique, and the avoidance of IMF in most cases.

Patients who underwent surgical treatment for primary parotid MEC and those with a second malignancy of parotid MEC were retrospectively identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The primary outcome variables were OS and DSS. The hazard ratios (HRs) of these survival rates associated with cancer history were analysed using Cox regression models. In total, 2681 patients were included, 263 of whom had a second malignancy. The 10-year OS rates in the primary (72%) and second malignancy groups (59%) were significantly different. Cox regression confirmed that a history of cancer tended to decrease OS (p¬†=¬†0.062, HR: 1.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.99 to 1.64). Subgroup analyses showed that a history of solid tumour as opposed to haematological cancer predicted worse OS, with central nervous system tumours exhibiting a more significant influence than others (p¬†=¬†0.030 vs p¬†=¬†0.088). Cancer history was not related to DSS. A history of childhood/adolescent cancer negatively influenced the prognosis of patients with parotid MEC, and this effect was primarily driven by a history of solid malignancy.","Introduction
Owing to the rapid development of early diagnosis, improved therapy, supportive care, and multidisciplinary approaches, the number of long-term survivors with prior childhood/adolescent cancer increases annually by 2%. 1 However, survivors are still at risk: damage to the body from previous radiation and/or chemotherapy, which may not manifest for a long time,2 places them at greater risk of developing a secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN).3 A second malignancy of parotid mucoepidermoid carcinoma (sMEC) accounts for a non-negligible proportion of SMNs and has been described in multiple case reports as well as original studies with small sample sizes. 4–10
The occurrence of a sMEC has been reported in survivors with a history of leukaemia, neuroblastoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, sarcoma, and several other cancers.4–10 The demographic, pathological, and molecular features of sMEC may be comparable to those of primary parotid MEC (pMEC).11 However, reported differences in survival are inconsistent, with one study identifying similar overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in patients with pMEC and sMEC,12 and others describing worse OS and DSS in those with sMEC.11,13 Moreover, since these studies were limited by small sample sizes, a reliable conclusion cannot be drawn.
This study therefore aimed to identify differences between patients with primary and secondary parotid MEC, and to assess the impact of childhood/adolescent cancer history on prognosis.
Material and methods
Patient selection
All data were obtained from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 database (Incidence-SEER Research Plus Data, 18 Registries, November 2019 Submission 2000–2017), which provides publicly accessible cancer statistics with the aim of reducing the cancer burden in the US population. The profiles of patients who had undergone surgical treatment for parotid MEC between 2000 and 2018 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were as follows: the disease was primary or a second malignancy that developed following a prior cancer diagnosis during childhood or adolescence with a latency time of >5 years between the first cancer diagnosis and sMEC occurrence, and the patient had received surgical treatment for parotid MEC. Patients with a history of previous MEC or no detailed information on surgical procedures or follow up were excluded (Supplementary Figure). Data on demographic characteristics, histological grade, cancer stage, treatment, and follow up were extracted from the database and analysed. Ethics approval was not required for this study as the data are publicly accessible.
Variable definitions
Cancer stage, defined as localised, regional, or distant, was based on SEER stage classification.14 Histological grade was classified as low for well-differentiated, intermediate for moderately differentiated, and high for poorly or undifferentiated tissue. Treatment was divided into surgery only, surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, or surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Latency was defined as the duration between the first cancer diagnosis and sMEC confirmation. Finally, race (white, black, or other) and marital status (married, single, or other) were also categorised for assessment.15
The primary outcome variables were OS and DSS. OS time was calculated from the date of MEC treatment to the date of death or final follow up, and DSS time was calculated from the treatment date to the date of cancer-caused death or final follow up.
Statistical analyses
Demographic and clinicopathological variables were compared between the pMEC and sMEC groups using chi squared tests. Differences in OS and DSS between the pMEC and sMEC groups were evaluated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to further explore the independent effects of childhood/adolescent cancer history on OS and DSS; hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for both survival rates. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.4.3 (R: a language and environment for statistical computing. R Core Team). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
Baseline data
In total, 2681 patients were included in the study, 1351 (50.4%) of whom were male, with a mean (SD) age of 55 (23) years. Additionally, 74.7% of the patients were white and 59.5% were married at the time of MEC diagnosis. Slightly more patients were treated before 2010 (n = 1509, 56.3%). The histological grade was low in 655 (24.4%) patients, intermediate in 1070 (39.9%), high in 651 (24.3%), and unknown in 305 (11.4%). Cancer was localised in 1707 (63.7%) patients, regional in 703 (26.2%), distant in 223 (8.3%), and unknown in 48 (1.8%). A total of 1252 patients received adjuvant radiotherapy, 138 of whom also underwent chemotherapy.
Among the included patients, 2418 (90.2%) had pMEC (pMEC group) and 263 (9.8%) had sMEC (sMEC group). The median (range) latency between prior cancer diagnosis and sMEC was 9.8 (5.2–38.7) years. The previous cancer type was haematological (56.9% leukaemia and 43.1% lymphoma) in 167 patients and solid in 96. Among the solid tumours, the most common was central nervous system cancer (n = 36, 37.5%) followed by neuroblastoma (n = 15, 15.6%), and the least frequent type was germ cell cancer (n = 9, 9.4%; Supplementary Table).
Demographic and clinicopathological differences between pMEC and sMEC groups
Significant differences in age (p < 0.001), race (p < 0.001), year of diagnosis (p < 0.001), cancer stage (p < 0.001), and treatment type (p = 0.006) were identified between the pMEC and sMEC groups. Compared with those in the pMEC group, patients in the sMEC group were more likely to be younger, non-white, and to have regional-stage disease. Moreover, adjuvant therapy, especially adjuvant radiotherapy alone, was more commonly administered in the sMEC group. The two groups had similar distributions of sex (p = 0.080), marital status (p = 0.624), and histological grade (p = 0.353) (Table 1).

Impact of childhood/adolescent cancer history on survival
After a mean (SD) follow-up time of 85 (64) months, 673 deaths had occurred, 298 of which were caused by parotid MEC. The overall 10-year DSS and OS rates were 86% (95% CI: 84% to 88%) and 69% (95% CI: 67% to 71%), respectively.
In the univariate analysis of DSS, the 10-year rates were not significantly different between the groups (86%; 95% CI: 84% to 88% for the pMEC group and 83%; 95% CI: 77% to 89% for the sMEC group, p = 0.734) (Fig. 1). Additionally, patients who underwent different treatments had similar DSS rates (p = 0.301). On the other hand, age, sex, race, year of diagnosis, marital status, histological grade, and cancer stage were significantly associated with DSS. The multivariate analysis also showed that cancer history did not influence DSS (p = 0.378; HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 0.75 to 3.28). Independent predictors of DSS included age, year of diagnosis, histological grade, and cancer stage (Table 2).

In the univariate analysis of OS, the 10-year OS rates were significantly different between the two groups (72%; 95% CI: 70% to 74% for the pMEC group and 59%; 95% CI: 51% to 67% for the sMEC group, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2). Other significant factors included age, race, sex, year of diagnosis, marital status, histological grade, and cancer stage. Cox regression similarly showed that a history of cancer tended to decrease OS (p = 0.062; HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.64).

Subgroup analyses
The potential effects of cancer history stratified by latency time and pathological type were analysed. Compared with patients with no cancer history, latency of more than or less than 10 years in the secondary group did not affect DSS (both p > 0.05), but both durations tended to decrease OS rates (p = 0.076 and p = 0.054, respectively). History of a solid tumour predicted worse OS than did prior haematological cancer, whereas neither had a significant effect on DSS. Central nervous system tumours in particular were more significantly related to OS than others (p = 0.030 vs p = 0.088). A history of leukaemia or lymphoma did not significantly affect OS (Table 4).

Discussion
The major findings of the current study were: (1) the median time for the development of sMEC following the occurrence of primary cancer in childhood/adolescence was nearly 10 years; (2) a cancer history was likely to decrease OS but not DSS; and (3) this effect was primarily due to a history of solid malignancy, especially central nervous system cancer. Our study has characterised the significance of childhood/adolescent cancer history in survival in parotid MEC, which may aid the clinical management of such patients in future.
Due to rapid progress in medicine, survival is improving in patients with childhood/adolescent cancer. However, concerns have been raised that the incidence of a SMN in these survivors is increasing. The cumulative SMN incidence after 30 years may be as high as 8.8% in survivors of childhood sarcoma,3 and the median latency from first cancer diagnosis to SMN occurrence has been reported as 6.8 years. Additionally, Villanueva et al16 reported that after a median follow up of nine years, 24 of 714 (3.4%) patients with pediatric retinoblastoma developed 25 SMNs. Another study reported that the risk of SMNs remained elevated for more than 20 years for all primary childhood cancer diagnoses,17 so it is not surprising that the histological types of previous cancers in the current study were relatively complex. Interestingly, the median latency between first cancer diagnosis and sMEC occurrence in our study was nearly 10 years, slightly longer than that reported in the literature. Unlike other similar studies,18 in the assessment of SMNs, we included only parotid MEC, which usually grows slowly and without apparent initial symptoms,19 making early detection difficult; this may explain the longer latency period in the current study. The occurrence of a SMN differs with age, sex, family history, pathology, stage of first cancer, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. For example, alkylating agents, which are typically an important component of leukaemia chemotherapy, are associated with an increased risk of SMNs. 6
The clinicopathological features of parotid MEC have been frequently evaluated, although few studies have compared pMEC and sMEC; to the best of our knowledge only four such original studies were available for review. Védrine et al 12 were the first to report that primary and secondary MEC groups had similar distributions of age, sex, tumour grade, and tumour location, and that advanced clinical stage disease was more likely to occur in survivors with sMEC. However, only 18 cases were included in this analysis, which limits the study’s conclusiveness. Verma et al 20 reviewed 58 secondary chemotherapy or radiotherapy-induced MEC cases and observed that the parotid gland was organ most likely to be involved (87.5% of the cancers had a low or intermediate histological grade, and most patients were staged as T1 or T2). Hao et al 11 systematically analysed the demographic, pathological, and molecular features of 63 primary and 15 secondary MECs. Suggesting that these two cancers are essentially the same, the two groups showed comparable distributions of age, sex, tumour stage, neck lymph node stage, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, p53 and BCL-2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and Ki-67 index. This finding conflicts with our observation that patients with sMEC were significantly younger than those with pMEC. Since we only selected patients with a childhood/adolescent cancer history for the sMEC group, differences in year of diagnosis, cancer stage, and treatment may be explained by advancements in disease understanding and medical technology that provided patients with earlier and more accurate diagnoses as well as improved treatments.
Several studies have evaluated the influence of cancer history on survival. Worse prognosis was predicted in patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, sarcoma, or breast, thyroid, or testicular cancer.21 Additionally, a longer latency time (>5 years) suggested an overall increased risk of death. 22 At the time, whether these conclusions could be applied to MEC was unclear. Védrine et al 12 reported that differences in OS and DSS rates between primary and secondary MEC groups were not statistically significant, although their sample size was small. Hao et al 11 and Seng et al 13 determined that a history of cancer was significantly associated with decreased DSS; these authors proposed that previous chemotherapy for blood malignancy had a significantly adverse impact on the lymphatic defence system. Conversely, our study showed that a history of childhood/adolescent cancer did not affect DSS but tended to decrease OS. This difference may be explained by our study design. We only enrolled patients with sMEC who had a latency time of more than five years (because a five-year disease-free period would typically classify the patient as ‘cured’ for most cancers) so patients with pMEC and sMEC had similar DSS rates in our study.
To our knowledge, we are the first to analyse the effect of the pathological type of previous cancer on survival of sMEC. We observed that previous solid cancers, especially central nervous system tumours, influenced OS. Paediatric central nervous system tumours usually require radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which is poorly tolerated by children and adolescents; further, these tumours often affect growth and development, especially cognitive and learning abilities, potentially leading to an increased overall mortality risk.
The limitations of the current study should be acknowledged. First, this was a retrospective study that consequently had inherent bias. Secondly, our findings were based only on parotid MEC, and external validation is needed before clinical application. Thirdly, it was challenging, if not impossible, to accurately determine why certain treatment choices were made.
In summary, a childhood/adolescent cancer history decreased OS but not DSS, and the effect on OS was mainly influenced by a history of solid as opposed to haematological malignancy, especially central nervous system cancer.

With advancements in early diagnosis and treatment, long-term survival rates for childhood cancers have increased, yet survivors remain at risk for secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) due to prior radiation or chemotherapy. The researchers identified 2681 patients who underwent surgical treatment for parotid MEC, classifying them as pMEC (n = 2418) or sMEC (n = 263) if the tumor developed more than five years after the initial cancer diagnosis.

Key findings revealed that patients in the sMEC group were generally younger, more likely to be non-white, and had a higher incidence of regional-stage disease compared to the pMEC group. They also more frequently received adjuvant radiotherapy. Although disease-specific survival (DSS) was similar between the groups—with 10-year DSS rates of approximately 86% for pMEC and 83% for sMEC—overall survival (OS) was significantly lower in the sMEC group (59% versus 72% at 10 years). Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that a history of childhood/adolescent cancer did not significantly affect DSS but tended to reduce OS, especially in patients with a history of solid tumors such as central nervous system cancers.

The study underscores the nearly 10-year median latency for sMEC development and highlights that while prior cancer history does not worsen disease-specific outcomes, it may adversely impact overall survival, necessitating tailored long-term management for these patients.","This study investigates differences between primary (pMEC) and secondary (sMEC) parotid mucoepidermoid carcinoma, focusing on the impact of prior childhood/adolescent cancer on prognosis. Using the SEER database (2000-2018), the researchers analyzed data from 2681 patients who underwent surgery for parotid MEC, comparing demographic, pathological, and treatment variables between 2418 pMEC and 263 sMEC cases.

Results showed sMEC patients were younger, more likely non-white, and often diagnosed with regional-stage disease, receiving adjuvant therapy more frequently. While disease-specific survival (DSS) was similar between groups, overall survival (OS) was significantly lower in sMEC patients. Multivariate analysis confirmed cancer history didn't impact DSS, but solid tumors especially central nervous system tumors were associated with decreased OS. The median latency between initial cancer and sMEC was approximately 10 years.

The study concludes that childhood/adolescent cancer history decreases OS but not DSS in parotid MEC, particularly when the prior malignancy was a solid tumor, emphasizing the need for vigilance in long-term survivors.","This study investigates the differences between primary parotid mucoepidermoid carcinoma (pMEC) and secondary parotid mucoepidermoid carcinoma (sMEC) in patients with a history of childhood/adolescent cancer, using data from the SEER database (2000–2018).

In this study we explored the impact of dental status on the development of PONI, using orthopantomograms to assess edentulism, periodontal health, and caries status. Retrospective analysis was performed for all new oral cancer patients who had neck dissection between January 2008 and January 2020 in a tertiary head and neck centre. PONI risk factors assessed included patient characteristics, dental status, tumour, and surgical factors. Development of PONI was the primary outcome. Edentulous patients had lower risk of PONI (OR 0.06, p¬†=¬†0.026) compared to those with 21 or more teeth. Periodontitis and dental caries were not statistically significant. Current smokers (OR 2.09, p¬†=¬†0.044) and free flap reconstruction (OR 5.41, p¬†<¬†0.001) were also significant predictors for development of PONI. This study highlights the presence of teeth as a potential source of infection post neck dissection and that orthopantomogram assessment may be inadequate to identify at risk patients. Future studies are required on direct clinical assessment of dentition to evaluate the impact of dental optimisation in prevention of PONI.","Introduction
Neck dissection (ND) is integral to management of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as cervical nodal metastases is the most significant prognostic factor.1 Neck dissection improves survival, even for early tumours, and up to 30% of clinically node-negative patients are found to have involved nodes following elective ND.2,3 However, ND is not without risk and postoperative neck infection (PONI) may affect prognosis by delaying adjuvant therapy4 and prolonging admissions.5
Neck dissections are typically clean procedures, but they are classified as clean-contaminated when performed in conjunction with oral cancer resection.6 According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, PONI in clean-contaminated ND should be less than 10%.7 Comparatively, the occurrence of infection among surgically-treated OSCC patients, irrespective of antimicrobial use, is disproportionately high with documented rates ranging from 10% to 40%.8–10
Postoperative neck infection is multifactorial with studies identifying prolonged operative time, presence of tracheostomy, and patient comorbidities as significant predictors.9–11 Alcoholism, active smoking, and higher categories in the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification increase the risk of surgical site infections.4,9–12 The impact of oral hygiene on PONI, however, is poorly understood. While Sato et al13 described preoperative dental care as a means to decrease the risk of infection, others have not found this association.4,8 Oral microflora have been documented as common pathogens for OSCC patients with postoperative infections.14
It is important to consider a patient’s dentition during planning for OSCC surgery and dentists are critical to the Head and Neck Multidisciplinary Team.15 While dental examination is recommended in OSCC treatment guidelines,16 accessibility to preoperative assessment is often limited by resource availability. Consequently, some centres rely on orthopantomography (OPG) for dentition assessment and identification of patients who may benefit from preoperative dental optimisation. Patients with fewer teeth should theoretically have a lower oral bacterial load, reducing risk of PONI. The aim of this study is to define the association of edentulism, periodontal and caries status to PONI using OPG as a screening tool.
Methodology
In a retrospective study, histologically confirmed OSCC patients who had ablative surgery and ND at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital between 1 January 2008 and 31 January 2020 were eligible. The NDs were typically performed prior to the OSCC ablation but all neck wounds were considered ‘clean-contaminated’ as surgical instruments for wound closure of neck and oral cavity were not separate. Cefazolin and metronidazole, or lincosamides for patients with penicillin/cephalosporin allergies, were prescribed perioperatively and 48 hours postoperatively.
Patients with no OPG records were excluded. Patients who had salvage ND for recurrence or radiotherapy were excluded due to altered neck anatomy, fibrosis, and perivascular necrosis that impaired tissue healing with increased risk of infection.17
Variables included patient characteristics, dental status, tumour factors, and surgical techniques. Patient characteristics included age, gender, smoking history, and immunosuppression. Patients were considered immunosuppressed if comorbid with conditions such as, but not limited to, diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis or exposure to immunosuppressant medications. Smoking status was defined as life-long non-smoker, current smoker, and ex-smoker if they smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime but stopped at least 28 days prior to surgery.18
Tumours were categorised according to T and N classification as per the eighth Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).19 Surgical factors included unilateral or bilateral ND, free flap reconstruction and site of tumour resection.
Dental status was assessed on caries, degree of edentulism and periodontal health. Caries status was graded based on a combination of degree of caries and number of quadrants involved (Table 1). Degree of edentulism (Table 2) was graded by the number of teeth on preoperative OPG. Periodontal health and dental caries were assessed on preoperative OPG as indirect measures of oral hygiene and bacterial biofilm. Periodontal grading was adapted from the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP),20 measured by the ratio of bone loss (Fig. 1) to age and graded from 1 to 3 (Table 2).

Dental assessments were performed independently on preoperative OPG by three experienced clinicians, who were blinded to patient outcomes, demographics, factors related to the tumour, and surgical procedures. Final grades were recorded on consensus between two or more clinicians. Interobserver reliability was 100% on degree of edentulism, 99% for periodontal grading, and 94% for caries grading. Discrepancies were re-assessed, and final gradings were recorded upon discussion.
The primary outcome was development of PONI, diagnosed and documented in patients’ clinical notes within 30 days of surgery21 in both inpatient or outpatient settings. PONI diagnosis was based on clinical findings including neck swelling, cutaneous erythema and/or purulent discharge. Time to infection was recorded in days from date of ND to diagnosis. All PONI had a wound swab sent for microscopy and culture.
Statistical analysis
Predictor variables and outcomes are displayed as numbers and percentages for categorical variables. Associations between variables and primary outcome were examined using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. For multivariable model building, initially all dental factors and additional variables with p ≤ 0.30 were included in models, characteristics were sequentially removed in order of highest to lowest p value until only those with p < 0.05 remained in the model. Finally, each variable was individually re-added to the model and any with p < 0.05 retained in the final model. The results of multivariable logistic regression analyses were presented as odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Stata v17.0 (Stata Corp) was used to complete statistical analysis and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 780 patients were identified. Two-hundred-and-eight patients who had surgery without ND were excluded. A further 57 patients without preoperative OPGs were excluded. Of 515 eligible patients, 65.2% were male. The largest proportion were aged between 60–79 years (49.9%).
Table 2 shows the patient characteristics. There were 210 current smokers (40.8%) and 91 (17.7%) immunocompromised patients. T1 tumour accounted for 13.6% of patients with the remainder approximately equally distributed between T2 to T4 classification. The majority of 515 eligible patients (77.5%) had unilateral ND and were N0 (60.6%) post ND. 321 patients (62.3%) received free flap reconstruction and the most common cancer site was the tongue (47.2%).
PONI was diagnosed in 55 patients (10.7%) with a median time to infection of 12 days (interquartile range 7–21 days), ranging from four to 30 days. Table 3 lists the bacteria cultured from wound swabs with Streptococcus milleri (56.4%) being the predominantly isolated bacteria. Univariable associations between development of PONI and predictor variables are presented in Table 4. The variables that were statistically significant in the multivariable model were number of teeth (including no teeth), smoking status, and type of reconstruction (Table 5).

Patient characteristics
Univariable analysis showed those aged below 60 (15.9%, N = 226) were more likely to develop PONI (p = 0.012). Current smokers had higher infection rates (15.2%, N = 210) than non-smokers (7.1%, N = 184) and ex-smokers (8.3%, N = 121, p = 0.023). Immunosuppressed patients had similar rates (12.1%, N = 91) to immunocompetent patients (10.4%, N = 424, p = 0.63). There were trends towards increased rates of PONI in tumours of higher T and N classification, but not statistically significant.
In multivariable analysis, the only patient characteristic that remained statistically significant was smoking status (p = 0.044). Current smokers had twice the odds of developing PONI (OR 2.09; 95% Cl, 1.02 to 4.26) as non-smokers, while ex-smokers were not at increased risk (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.39 to 2.30).
Surgical factors
Free flap reconstruction (p < 0.001), bilateral ND (p = 0.004) and cancer site (p = 0.04) were associated with PONI in univariable analysis. Free flap reconstruction was the only surgical factor that remained statistically significant in the multivariable model with odds of PONI being almost 5.5 times more likely than patients without reconstruction (OR 5.41; 95% CI 2.22 to 13.16; p < 0.001).
Dental status
Univariable analysis showed lower rates of PONI with one edentulous patient (1.1%, N = 89, p = 0.012) having PONI compared to 54 dentate patients (12.7%, N = 426). However, this association was not reflected with increasing number of teeth (p = 0.72). Caries grading was also not associated with PONI (p = 0.40). Although not statistically significant (p = 0.079), there was a trend towards higher rates of PONI in patients with higher grades of periodontitis, where seven grade 1 (7.9%, N = 89), 33 grade 2 (12.4%, N = 267), and 14 grade 3 (20%, N = 70) patients had PONI.
The only dental characteristic that was an independent predictor in the multivariable model was number of teeth (p = 0.026). Edentulous patients had the lowest PONI risk (OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.43) followed by those with 1–8 teeth (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.13 to 1.54) while those with 9–20 teeth (OR, 1.02; 95% CI 0.51 to 2.07) had similar odds to those with 21 or more teeth (reference).
Exploratory analysis (Supplementary Table 1) showed smoking status was associated with dental status. Current smokers were more likely to be edentulous (p = 0.002), have fewer teeth (p = 0.014), and worse grading for periodontitis (p < 0.001) and caries (p < 0.001).
Discussion
This study demonstrated the presence of teeth to be associated with an increased PONI risk. Edentulous patients had substantially lowered odds of PONI. Independently of dental status, patients who had free flap reconstruction had five times the odds of PONI. Current smokers had twice the odds as non-smokers, while ex-smokers had the same risk as non-smokers. Overall, the rate of PONI was found to be 10.7% for 515 OSCC patients treated with tumour resection and ND. This was on the lower end of reported incidences between 10% to 40%.8,9,11
It would be expected for older patients with medical comorbidities and immunosuppression to be at higher risk of infection. However, PONI was not associated with either in this analysis. Patients above 60 years were found to have a lower rate of PONI, but this may have been confounded by the likelihood that older patients will have fewer teeth or be edentulous. Although younger age was associated with development of PONI in univariable analysis, this was no longer present in adjusted analysis, further suggesting the univariable between age and PONI was confounded by edentulism.
Postoperative neck infection was significantly less in edentulous patients (1.1%, N = 89). This is consistent with previous findings of decreased bacterial load and diversity in edentulous patients’ saliva.22,23 Patients with fewer teeth may have a similar advantage compared to those with more of their dentition. Although not statistically significant, patients with eight teeth or fewer had half the odds of developing PONI, while patients with more than eight teeth had the same odds as fully dentate patients.
Dental and periodontal cleaning removes biofilm, which may decrease bacterial contamination of a neck wound. In this study, statistical analysis on dental disease identified on OPG did not demonstrate statistical significance and the extent of dental caries was not associated with PONI. However, worsening periodontal health did show a possible trend for increasing rates of PONI, where there was a 12.1% increased rate of PONI between patients with slow and rapidly progressing periodontitis. Given the strong association between smoking and dental status, it may be that smoking status, rather than dental status, is conferring the risk for PONI. However, the absence of statistical significance may also be attributable to the lower rate of PONI in this study.
Oral bacteria, namely Streptococcus milleri, was the predominant bacteria cultured in this study (56%, N = 55) while gram negative organisms accounted for 18.1% (N = 55). In contrast, Iwamoto et al14 isolated higher numbers of gram negative periodontopathic bacteria in patients with mandibular gingival malignancy and wound infections. The lower number of periodontopathic bacteria cultured may explain the absence of association between periodontal disease and PONI. Future research with clinical periodontal assessment and evaluation of biofilm would shed more light on the impact of periodontal disease on PONI as OPG cannot differentiate between active and stabilised disease.
Postoperative neck infection relating to advanced tumours and aggressive surgeries is a recurrent theme in the literature. Karakida et al11 and Lofti et al8 found those with advanced tumour and nodal categories had a higher probability for infection. Tracheostomy and longer operative time have also been found to be predictors.9,10,24–26 Unsurprisingly, patients who received free flap reconstruction were found to have almost 5.5 times the odds of developing PONI to those without, consistent with work published by Ogihara et al25 and Gondo et al26 Iwamoto et al proposed OSCC in sites such as the floor of mouth, retromolar trigone and mandible were risk factors for infection due to oral-neck communication from surgical resection.14 This study did not identify an association of tumour site with PONI on multivariable analysis. However, free flap reconstruction, which fundamentally creates oral-neck communication through tunnelling of the flap and pedicle for vascular anastomoses, supports this theory.
Smoking was an independent predictor for PONI in this study. There is, however, no consensus on the impact of smoking in literature.9,11,27 A recent systematic review by Garip et al28 found smokers were at increased risk of haematoma and impaired wound healing but was not associated with infection. In contrast to other studies,24,29 medical comorbidities relating to immunosuppression were not associated with neck infection in the present study. It is important to note that analysis relating to patients’ medical health can be confounded by the quality of perioperative management at each institution. Therefore, early smoking cessation and optimisation of comorbidities is still recommended for all OSCC patients.
The lack of OPG records was the major limitation of this study. Clinical examination remains the gold standard in recording periodontitis, caries, and compliance with oral hygiene. It also allows assessment for signs of chronic infections such as periodontal pocketing, bleeding on probing, tooth mobility, and suppuration. While this study did not show statistical significance between dental status and PONI, there were observed trends of increased infection rate with higher grades of periodontitis. Further research is recommended to focus on clinical assessment of dentition to determine if dental optimisation would decrease the risk for PONI.
Conclusion
Patients with OSCC who are planned for free flap reconstruction are at high risk of PONI and early smoking cessation is also recommended for patients to decrease the risk of developing PONI. This study highlights the presence of teeth as a significant predictor for PONI. While OPG is a useful tool for rapid assessment of dentition without direct patient contact, future studies should take into account both direct and indirect assessments beyond the capabilities of OPG, in evaluating the impact of dental optimisation on PONI.

Recognizing that cervical nodal metastases are a major prognostic factor in OSCC and that ND, although generally a clean procedure, becomes clean-contaminated when performed with oral cancer resection, the study addressed why infection rates in OSCC patients range between 10% and 40%—exceeding the recommended infection rate of less than 10% for clean-contaminated surgeries. Prior research has identified factors such as prolonged operative time, tracheostomy, and patient comorbidities as risks for PONI, yet the role of oral hygiene remained unclear.

Data were collected from 515 OSCC patients treated at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital between January 2008 and January 2020, all of whom had preoperative orthopantomography (OPG) records. Patient variables included age, gender, smoking status, and immunosuppression, while tumour characteristics and surgical techniques (including unilateral versus bilateral ND and free flap reconstruction) were recorded. Dental status was assessed via OPG for number of teeth, degree of caries, and periodontal health. PONI was diagnosed in 10.7% of patients with a median onset of 12 days postoperatively. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the presence of teeth, smoking, and free flap reconstruction were independent predictors of PONI. Specifically, edentulous patients had substantially lower odds of infection, current smokers were at double the risk of non-smokers, and free flap reconstruction increased the risk by more than fivefold. The findings underscore the importance of dental evaluation, optimization, and early smoking cessation in reducing PONI risk in OSCC management.","This retrospective study investigates the relationship between dental status, assessed via orthopantomography (OPG), and postoperative neck infection (PONI) in 515 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients undergoing ablative surgery and neck dissection. The study found a PONI rate of 10.7%, with Streptococcus milleri being the most common pathogen.

Multivariable analysis revealed that edentulous patients had significantly lower odds of PONI compared to dentate patients. Current smokers had twice the risk of PONI than non-smokers, and free flap reconstruction increased the odds of infection by over five times. While individual dental conditions such as caries and periodontal disease were assessed, only the number of teeth independently predicted PONI risk. The study suggests that the presence of teeth increases the risk of PONI, potentially due to higher oral bacterial load.","This study investigates the association between dental status and postoperative neck infection (PONI) in 515 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients who underwent neck dissection (ND) and tumor resection. PONI, diagnosed in 10.7% of cases, was significantly influenced by the presence of teeth, with edentulous patients having the lowest risk (1.1%). Patients with fewer teeth (1–8) also showed reduced PONI risk compared to those with more teeth. Free flap reconstruction increased PONI risk fivefold, while current smokers had twice the risk of non-smokers. Dental caries and periodontal health, assessed via orthopantomography (OPG), did not significantly correlate with PONI, though a trend suggested higher PONI rates with worse periodontal health. The study highlights the importance of dental status in PONI risk, particularly in patients undergoing free flap reconstruction, and underscores the need for smoking cessation. Limitations include reliance on OPG for dental assessment, which may not capture active periodontal disease.

PHPT patients, undergoing parathyroidectomy, voluntarily completed a modified Pasieka Parathyroidectomy Assessment Score (PAS), a tool correlating 13 PHPT symptoms to QoL.

Patients with PHPT demonstrated impaired QoL as evidenced by the PAS, and assessing this is valuable in treatment planning. Parathyroidectomy impacts the symptoms that most affect QoL and significantly improves overall QoL in these patients.","Introduction
Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine condition affecting approximately 1% of the adult population.1 PHPT has an increasing incidence with age, usually presenting in the sixth decade of life. Given the age distribution and having a female to male ratio 3-4:1, PHPT classically occurs in post-menopausal patients.2 While the vast majority of PHPT cases are due to solitary benign parathyroid adenomas (80%), multiple adenomas, multi-gland hyperplasia, and parathyroid carcinoma are potential causes.3,4
PHPT is usually associated with an elevated, or inappropriately high normal, parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration and resultant hypercalcaemia. The frequently reported symptoms of PHPT can include bone aches, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, excessive urination, low impact fractures, renal stones, and constipation.5 A subset of patients may also present with acute dehydration, acute kidney injury, fragility fractures from osteoporosis, hypertension, renal stone disease or chronic kidney disease.6 The psychoneurological and cognitive dysfunction symptoms lack specificity and are often undifferentiated, such as easy fatiguability, poor concentration, depression, cognitive decline, and mood swings.6–19 Although these symptoms have a marked impact on quality of life (QoL), they are commonly misinterpreted as a process of normal ageing or postmenopausal state due to the demographic affected by PHPT.9 It should be noted many patients with PHPT can be asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms, however, and are diagnosed incidentally through biochemical screening. Interestingly these patients are still at risk of end organ damage.3
Parathyroidectomy is the primary treatment option for PHPT. If surgery is unsuitable, declined, or unsuccessful, non-surgical management may be considered. Non-surgical management includes calcimimetics and bisphosphonates, which assists in managing hypercalcaemia and increased bone turnover.20,21 Currently indications for surgery relate to symptoms and effects of hypercalcaemia and osteopenia.5,21,22 Despite the impact on QoL many of the symptoms of PHPT have on patients, especially the psychoneurological and cognitive dysfunction symptoms, current guidelines do not take an assessment of PAS symptoms and QoL into account.3,6,7,10,11,14
Symptoms, particularly the psychoneurological and cognitive dysfunction symptoms, are non-specific and have not shown a strong link to the degree of biochemical derangement.3,14,23 It is therefore difficult to quantify the impact on QoL that PHPT has on a patient by using biochemical markers alone. Several studies have previously been conducted to assess the improvement of overall QoL of PHPT patients. These have generally used standardised systems of well-being and QoL evaluation such as RAND-36 of SF-36 scales. Pasieka et al developed a simplified tool specific to PHPT: a set of 13 questions (parathyroid assessment score or PAS) that has been shown to be an accurate tool to analyse the impact of QoL in the PHPT patients pre and postoperatively.8,9,13,20 Evidence confirming this link is conflicted, with a recent Cochrane review by Pappachan et al highlighting limitations with current evidence.3,7,14,20,23 While parathyroidectomy corrects underlying calcium and PTH levels, and one would expect an improvement in symptoms and therefore overall QoL, its impact on improving patients’ frequently reported symptoms is not clear.
We conducted a prospective study to review the impact of parathyroidectomy on frequently reported symptoms known to impact QoL in PHPT patients.
Material and methods
This was a single-centre prospective observational study reviewing all patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for PHPT under the care of a single surgeon between December 2019 to October 2023 (three years and nine months). The surgical technique was consistent with standard techniques.24 The inclusion criteria for this study were: confirmed diagnosis of PHPT in adults requiring surgical treatment based on current NICE guidelines;22 undergoing parathyroidectomy within the study period of December 2019 to October 2023; voluntary and complete completion of preoperative and postoperative symptom score assessment. Patients with normocalcaemic PHPT were excluded from the study. No adjustment for comorbidities or other potential confounding factors was made. All patients with incomplete data were excluded from this study.
The impact and severity of symptoms on a patient’s QoL was quantified using a disease specific Parathyroid Assessment Score (PAS), originally reported by Pasieka et al.10 This is a self-reported assessment tool, measuring the impact of PHPT on a patient’s QoL. This has been shown to correlate to the SF-36 QoL scores and is an accurate method of assessing overall health status and QoL for PHPT patients.10,12,15
Patients were asked to complete an identical standardised questionnaire pre and postoperatively through a mixture of paper and electronic means. This was the standard 13 symptom PAS questionnaire with an addition of nausea.15 A visual analogue scale was used to assist patients to score each symptom from 0-100. Total PAS was calculated as the sum of all 13 symptoms (maximum score 1300), excluding nausea. The self-reported pre and post ECOG/WHO Performance Status and Clinical Frailty Scale scores were also collected for this cohort. Pre and post parathyroidectomy scores of the 14 symptoms above, as well as the total PAS score, were assessed and examined for trends and significance in line with previously published similar studies.25
Biochemical markers are used as an both a diagnostic tool and an objective measure of successful treatment in PHPT.26 Pre and post parathyroidectomy albumin adjusted calcium and PTH were collected as biochemical markers for PHPT. The samples for this study were not taken at any specific intervals pre or post treatment.
The normality of the data was determined using Shapiro − Wilk statistical test. Statistical comparisons were conducted via the Student’s t test and Mann–Whitney U test, in accordance with the normality of the data. Pearson and Spearman correlations were used to assess for correlation between the change in different biochemical markers of PHPT and change in symptom score for individual symptom as well as total PAS scores. All tests were two-tailed, with a statistical significance of p < 0.05. The data analysis for this paper was performed using Microsoft Excel© and the Real Statistics Resource Pack software (Release 8.9.1). Copyright (2013 – 2023) Charles Zaiontz. www.real-statistics.com.
Results
Sixty of the initial 82 patients identified as undergoing parathyroidectomy for PHPT met all the inclusion criteria. Twenty-two patients were excluded due to having an incomplete data set as result of being lost to follow up, opting out of study (n = 20), or being deceased (n = 2). The mean age was 64 years old (range 26-85 years), with a 4:1 female to male ratio.
Although an overall pre to post parathyroidectomy improvement in both the self-reported performance status and frailty index score was observed (from modes of 1 to 0, and 3 to 2, respectively), this change was not considered significant (p = 0.23 and p = 0.07, respectively). No adjustments were made for other comorbidities and progression thereof.
Prior to surgery, the most common symptoms were: feeling tired easily (97%, n = 58); being forgetful (85%, n = 51); pain in the joints (82%, n = 49); feeling irritable (80%, n = 48) bone pain (75%, n = 45); feeling weak (75%, n = 45); mood swings (70%, n = 42); and being thirsty (70%, n = 42). Parathyroidectomy reduced severity of mean total PAS by 44%, improving from 509 to 284 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1). A total of 77% (n = 46) of patients experienced some improvement of PAS.

All 14 symptoms assessed showed a reduction in individual symptom PAS (Fig. 2). The five highest reported individual symptom PAS showed a significant reduction post parathyroidectomy. These were feeling tired easily (mean PAS 65 vs 38, 43% reduction, p < 0.01); pain in the joints (52 vs 31, 40% reduction, p < 0.01); being thirsty (46 vs 22, 52% reduction, p < 0.01); being forgetful (45 vs 28, or 38% reduction, p < 0.01); and bone pain (45 vs 27, 52% reduction, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3). This indicates a significant chance of reducing the symptoms that cause the highest impact on QoL.

Adding nausea as a modification to the PAS did not impact on assessment of symptoms as a predictor of QoL as nausea was the least severe symptom and showed only a very small reduction in severity of 3 (p = 0.48) (Fig. 2).
The mean pre and postoperative corrected calcium was 2.73 mmol/L and 2.35 mmol/L (reference range, 2.2 – 2.6 mmol/L), with a mean reduction of 0.35 mmol/L (p < 0.001). The mean pre and postoperative PTH 23.35 pmol/L and 8.35 pmol/L (reference range, 1.6 – 7.2 pmol/L), with a mean reduction of 15.0 pmol/L (p < 0.001). Correlation was assessed between PAS and biochemical markers of PHPT as well as individual symptom PAS and biochemical markers of PHPT. Although it was noted that a weak positive association of calcium and pre parathyroidectomy PAS existed (Pearson’s coefficient 0.23, p = 0.08), this was neither significant nor was there a correlation between post treatment calcium and PAS (Pearson’s coefficient 0.05, p = 0.7). No other linear association was found between biochemical markers of PHPT and the PAS.
Discussion
This study demonstrates a significant reduction in the burden of symptoms following parathyroidectomy in patients with PHPT. In this single centre retrospective analysis of 60 patients revealed a significant decrease in the mean total PAS from 509 to 284, representing a substantial decrease (44% less) in experienced burden of disease for these patients. A total of 77% of patients reported some improvement in symptoms and the overall improvement in total PAS was predominantly because of reductions of the most debilitating symptoms reported by these patients. These included fatigue, joint pain, thirst, forgetfulness, and bone pain. The reported frequency of all symptoms, and improvement thereof, highlights the substantial impact of PHPT on patients' QoL and the potential for parathyroidectomy to significantly improve well-being in this cohort.
Numerous other similar studies have also shown that there appears to be a significant improvement in QoL following parathyroidectomy in PHPT patients.6,7,11,12,14–18 Despite these findings, a recent Cochrane review by Pappachan et al highlighted the difficulties in drawing conclusions from current studies due to the quality of evidence being limited.20 Randomised control trials have yet to show conclusively that parathyroidectomy compared to observation alone leads to a better health-related QoL outcome.8,9,20
While parathyroidectomy is effectively curative for the underlying biochemical derangements of PHPT, this study found no significant correlation between biochemical markers and PAS scores. This is supported by the literature that have not shown a reliable relationship between the degree of experienced symptoms and the level of biochemical derangements.20 Despite this, this study showed a significant reduction in the burden of the psychoneurological, and cognitive symptoms experienced by PHPT patients after parathyroidectomy. This is also supported by similar studies, which show these tend to have the strongest relationship with the underlying hypercalcemia of PHPT.13,14,23 Improvements in the psychoneurological and cognitive symptoms are likely to have a marked impact on daily activities, work productivity, and social interactions. By alleviating the burden of these distressing symptoms, parathyroidectomy has the potential to significantly enhance patients’ physical and psychological well-being and overall QoL. For this reason, there is some support for considering surgery in patients who do not meet the guideline recommended indications in cases where the surgeon, endocrinologist and patient agree on surgical treatment.19 An understanding of the severity of experienced symptoms and expected improvements thereof are a significant aid in this decision-making process.
While this study provides positive evidence for the role of parathyroidectomy in managing PHPT symptoms, several limitations warrant consideration. The sample size in this study was small and a large proportion of cases were excluded due to incomplete data/lost to follow up (22 of 82 cases or 26.8%). The lack of predetermined follow-up time intervals also reduced the standardisation of the data, making it difficult to assess the short- and long-term improvements in the PAS scores. This patient population underwent parathyroidectomy due to the current recommended guidelines, therefore the data is inherently skewed towards patients already being at risk for PHPT-associated complications. The lack of any control non-surgical group limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions as to the role of parathyroidectomy alone compared to observation over time in the change in these symptoms.
Due to the non-specific nature of the PAS symptoms, the lack of any comparison with a matched cohort of non-PHPT patients also makes it difficult to assess the true burden of disease and may confound results. For the same reason the lack of adjustment for other comorbidities is a significant limitation in interpretation of this data given the non-specific and generalist nature of symptoms that have significant overlap with several common medical conditions in this population of patients.27
Despite the above-mentioned limitations, the results of this study have significant clinical implications. The substantial improvement in quality of life reported by patients following parathyroidectomy highlights the importance of early diagnosis and intervention for PHPT. Additionally, the identification of specific symptoms that are most responsive to surgical treatment is useful to fully inform patient counselling and treatment planning.
Conclusions
This study highlights the negative impact PHPT has on patients’ QoL, and the role parathyroidectomy has in transforming the QoL for these patients. The lack of strong correlations between biochemical markers and PAS suggests the importance of considering the symptomatic burden, and potential improvement thereof, experienced by patients when making treatment decisions for PHPT. This study supports and adds to the already existing evidence showing parathyroidectomy impacts the symptoms that most affect QoL in PHPT, and that using a symptom-based assessment tool may provide valuable complementary information for treatment planning and evaluating outcomes.

Most cases of PHPT are due to solitary benign adenomas, although multiple adenomas, multi‐gland hyperplasia, and carcinoma can occur. PHPT is associated with hypercalcaemia and a range of symptoms including bone and joint pain, fatigue, kidney stones, and a variety of psychoneurological and cognitive disturbances, such as forgetfulness, mood swings, and depression. These symptoms are often misattributed to normal ageing despite their significant impact on daily living.

The study used a disease-specific Parathyroid Assessment Score (PAS)—a self-reported questionnaire originally comprising 13 symptoms (with an additional query on nausea)—to quantify symptom burden. Sixty patients undergoing parathyroidectomy between December 2019 and October 2023 completed pre- and postoperative assessments. Preoperatively, the most common symptoms were fatigue (97%), forgetfulness (85%), and joint pain (82%). Postoperatively, there was a statistically significant 44% reduction in the mean total PAS (from 509 to 284, p < 0.01), with significant improvements in fatigue, joint pain, thirst, forgetfulness, and bone pain. Although biochemical markers (corrected calcium and PTH) improved significantly, their changes did not correlate strongly with symptomatic improvement. Limitations include a small sample size, loss to follow-up, lack of a non-surgical control group, and unadjusted comorbidities. These important findings reinforce the need for tailored clinical decision-making in PHPT management.","This study investigates the impact of parathyroidectomy on quality of life (QoL) in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). PHPT, characterized by elevated PTH and hypercalcemia, often presents with non-specific symptoms affecting QoL. While surgery is the primary treatment, its impact on frequently reported symptoms is debated.

This prospective study assessed 60 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy using the Parathyroid Assessment Score (PAS), a PHPT-specific QoL tool. Results demonstrated a significant (44%) reduction in total PAS post-surgery, with 77% of patients reporting improved symptoms. The most improved symptoms were fatigue, joint pain, thirst, forgetfulness, and bone pain. Interestingly, there was no strong correlation between biochemical markers and PAS scores.

The authors conclude that parathyroidectomy significantly improves QoL by alleviating debilitating symptoms, emphasizing the importance of considering the symptomatic burden in treatment decisions. Despite limitations such as a small sample size, the study supports the use of symptom-based assessments for treatment planning and outcome evaluation in PHPT.","This study evaluates the impact of parathyroidectomy on the quality of life (QoL) of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) using the Parathyroid Assessment Score (PAS), a symptom-based tool.

Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is treated through surgical intervention. The tumour, including a layer of healthy tissue, is resected, aiming for radical resection. Guidelines categorise this resection margin as negative (>5 mm), close (1<5 mm), or positive (<1 mm) after histopathological assessment.1 Close and positive margins are associated with higher recurrence rates, and are therefore indicative of adjuvant therapy, which is described in up to 85% of cases.2 This highlights the necessity for intraoperative assessment to prevent unnecessary adjuvant therapies such as chemoradiation, radiation, or additional surgery.
Some techniques for intraoperative margin assessment are under investigation. Ultrasound (US) holds potential for this, displaying good consistency between 2D US tumour thickness and histopathology.3–5 De Koning et al achieved a 30% reduction in close margins by performing US-guided resection and 2D US ex-vivo assessment.6 A freehand acquisition method can extend US to 3D imaging, which considers tumour shape and minimises tissue deformation due to pressure from the US probe.7 Compared with a motorised 3D US system, Bekedam et al found that the motorised system was more stable, it offered better in-plane resolution, and had lower operator variability.8
Segmentation involves partitioning an image or volume into regions of interest. Manual segmentation (MS) is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Interpreting US images requires expertise and experience and can result in interobserver variability.5,9–12 Recent advances have shown that deep learning models are fast and reproducible, and 3D US can enlighten the clinical implementation of intraoperative margin assessment.10,13–16
In 2015 Ronneberger et al. presented the U-Net, a deep-learning network that excelled in medical applications, particularly with limited annotated images.17 Data augmentation, involving deformations such as rotation and scaling, was used to enlarge the training dataset. Nikolov et al developed a residual 3D U-Net model to segment 21 anatomical targets in the head and neck,9 incorporating information in subsequent slices. Optimising a model demands a manual and iterative process to configure the model’s design for a specific task, so Isensee et al. introduced the No New U-Net (nnUNet) to address this manual configuration problem.18 This model algorithmically optimised the architecture without the need for adaptation, and demonstrated accurate segmentation across different tasks and imaging modalities.18
This paper aimed to investigate use of a 3D nnUNet model for intraoperative segmentation of TSCC in 3D US volumes. First, the 3D nnUNet model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of 113 manually annotated 3D US volumes. Secondly, it was clinically validated on 16 prospective cases of resected TSCC by comparing the intraoperative final margin status (FMS), based on automatic segmentation (AS) and MS, with histopathology.
Method
Data acquisition
This study acquired 3D US data to train the nnUNet (following the EM navigated US freehand method)7 from 27 TSCC patients with T1-T3 tumours located on both sides of the border of the tongue. Specimens were placed with the tumour-side on a US gel pad (Aquaflex, Parker Laboratories) in a saline-filled container to lift the specimen to the centre of the image. A 10MHz US transducer held below the saline surface was used for freehand acquisition of the specimen. Simultaneous electromagnetic tracking of the position and orientation of the transducer during US acquisition enabled 3D US volume reconstruction.
Dataset
A total of 113 3D US volumes were acquired. The initial number of eight per patient was later reduced to three due to the learning curve. Seven volumes, all from one patient, were excluded due to severe artefacts. A trained technical physician manually annotated the specimen and tumour as ground truth labels. The FMS was annotated and assessed using 3D Slicer.19 The included dataset (n = 106) was randomly split at the patient level into a training and validation dataset (n = 89) and a separate test dataset (n = 17). Additionally, 16 3D US volumes were prospectively included for clinical validation.
Training and validating the model
The nnUNet was trained, validated, and tested on a dedicated server (Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS operating system, 16GB NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU, and Intel Xeon Gold 6146 CPU). This state-of-the-art network automatically configures a dataset-specific matching network. The nnUNet framework supports cross-validation and test-time augmentation (TTA). Cross-validation, five-fold by default, trains the model over five equal parts of the training dataset, and averages predictions for the final result. TTA deforms an image in multiple ways during prediction, with the model providing predictions for each deformation, and the final prediction is the average of these. While these techniques enhance segmentation performance, they increase computational time. Refer to Isensee et al18 for details of nnUNet. We trained and validated the 3D nnUNet, incorporating information from subsequent slices. Testing included three prediction settings: a 3D nnUNet (type 1), 3D nnUNet with cross-validation (type 2), and 3D nnUNet with cross-validation and TTA for inference (type 3).
Evaluation metrics
The network’s performance was evaluated using the following metrics: Dice volumetric similarity (DVS) score, Dice surface similarity (DSS) score, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), and average surface distance (ASD). These metrics, open-source available, were evaluated for clinical performance by Nikolov et al.9 The DVS for the whole volume and DSS per slice are Dice coefficients, which express the overlap between the predicted and ground truth segmentations. The Dice coefficient, which ranges from 0 (no correct predictions) to 1 (all pixels correctly predicted) does not consider background pixels. It can be computed by equation (1) with TP as true positive, FP as false positive, and FN as false negative.

Nikolov et al. introduced a tolerance in which slight deviations were considered correct surface overlap, a criterion maintained in our study, with a 0.5 mm range.9
The Hausdorff distance computes the closest distance from each element of the predicted surface to the ground truth surface, with the 95th percentile commonly used to mitigate sensitivity to outliers.
The ASD represents the average Euclidean distance between all elements of the predicted and ground truth surfaces bi-directionally.
Clinical validation
The trained 3D nnUNet was implemented clinically on a mobile workstation (Windows 10 Enterprise operating system, 4GB NVIDIA Quadro T2000 GPU, Intel Core i9-10885H CPU). It was validated on 16 3D US volumes from prospectively included TSCC patients, using the same metrics as the testing phase. Again, three prediction settings were explored, acknowledging a higher computational burden during cross-validation and TTA. The time to predict the segmentations was therefore recorded to assess clinical feasibility. A technical physician manually annotated the specimen and tumour segments as ground truth labels.
Although MS lacked multiple islands, AS could consist of various islands. The technical physician selected the best representing tumour island, referred to as semi-AS. This process was quick and reasonably objective compared with manually adjusting the AS of the tumour.
To evaluate the correlation between FMS and histopathology, the Pearson correlation coefficient was computed for AS, semi-AS, and MS. A correlation was considered significant when p<0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 27 (IBM Corp). The FMS was the closest resection margin found.
Results
This study trained, validated, and tested the 3D nnUNet model by predicting the specimen and tumour regions in 3D US volumes of freshly excised TSCC. The model was then clinically validated on a mobile workstation on 16 prospective 3D US volumes.
The final performance after testing the 3D nnUNet on the dedicated server is presented in Appendix A. Table 1 shows the results of the nnUNet on the mobile workstation for AS of the dataset for clinical validation (n = 16). The recorded time to predict was similar for both segments and only dependent on the prediction type. To emphasise, AS of the specimen resulted in a very high DVS of 0.99 and DSS of 1.0. The tumour segment had room for improvement, as the ASD was between 1.0 and 1.5 mm, with a HD95 of between 5.7 and 7.4 mm. Prediction without cross-validation and TTA was within 8 seconds the fastest. Segmentation performance did not improve by applying cross-validation and TTA while prediction time increased. Fig. 1 shows examples of manual and automatic segmentation.

For prediction type 1, in 7/16 3D US volumes, AS of the tumour contained multiple islands (for type 2 it was 6/16; for type 3 it was 4/16). As shown in Table 2, the DVS, DSS, and HD95 did not improve after adjustments; the ASD reduced to 0.4-0.9 mm. Selection of the island that best represented the tumour took around 30 seconds.

Discussion
This study investigated use of a 3D nnUNet model for intraoperative TSCC segmentation in 3D US volumes in two steps. First, the 3D nnUNet model was trained and evaluated on manually annotated 3D US volumes, followed by clinical implementation and validation. Secondly, we compared the effect of AS and MS on FMS. The primary finding was that prediction type 1, without cross-validation and TTA, performed best and predicted the fastest. Adjustments to AS of the tumour improved the ASD for prediction type 1, while types 2 and 3 remained similar due to a high SD. Additionally, MS moderately correlated with histopathology. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report use of the nnUNet to segment 3D US volumes of resected TSCC automatically.
Other studies that have reported implementation of the nnUNet model have reported reduced segmentation time without decreased performance for the final clinical task. Ferrante et al. used the nnUNet to automatically segment lung tumours on CT images, and investigated the impact of AS on survival radiomics models.10 Li et al reported that the nnUNet demonstrated faster and better AS performance of pelvic organ radiotherapy, resulting in an average difference in dosimetric parameters within 15% of the prescription dose.13 Our study has found that fast segmentation is feasible for intraoperative assessment and that there is room to improve the correlation between AS, MS, and histopathology.
This strength of the study is the clinical validation of the model’s output, showing that a small dataset can reach a moderate DVS score. The model was trained using MS as the ground truth, and clinical validation showed an insignificant moderate correlation between FMS based on MS and histopathology.
This leads to the limitation of MS as ground truth. Despite its reference status, MS can still be incorrect. Differentiation between tumour and healthy tissue was challenging, as TSCC has a heterogeneous hypoechoic presentation with an irregular shape.20 Secondly, MS was subject to observer variability. AS, slightly different from MS, could be considered incorrect. We tried to minimise this effect by using the Dice coefficient with a specific tolerance of 0.5 mm between the ground truth and predicted annotation. Tang et al reduced the observer variability using AS as a baseline for MS.12 Our study did not have a model to produce the AS as a baseline so we used MS only. In future, the approach of Tang et al12 can be used to reduce segmentation variability.
Besides the above mentioned factors, other aspects also influenced correlation between US measurements and histopathology. First, US, with a limited spatial resolution compared with the microscope, may miss small irregularly growing tumour parts. Secondly, the unknown measurement locations in the resected specimen introduced uncertainty when comparing US and histopathology measurements. Differences in measuring existed (histopathology assessed 4 mm thick slices and US assessed 0.5 mm thick slices), enabling margin assessment between the 4 mm histopathology slices. Additionally, US measurements could be performed in any direction due to 3D acquisition, while histopathology could only measure in-plane. Finally, tissue shrinkage must be considered due to pathological tissue processing with formalin and paraffin. El-Fol et al showed that shrinkage could be up to 42%.21 These effects could explain any differences in FMS between 3D US and histopathology.
Results showed good performance in all AS types of prediction for the specimen region, but outcomes for the tumour were lower. Prediction type 1 resulted in a DVS of 0.64, indicating that 64% of tumour pixels were correctly predicted. The ASD from the predicted tumour region to the MS was 1.33 mm, with an HD95 of approximately 6 mm. After adjustment, only the ASD for prediction type 1 improved. Visual inspection revealed a smaller AS than MS. Therefore, expanding AS of the tumour by a certain distance could compensate for the ASD and the above mentioned effects.
The clinical impact of AS on FMS showed a low correlation with histopathology compared with moderate correlation between MS and histopathology. MS as the model’s input must be more accurate to improve AS. Since histopathology is the gold standard, training the model on tumour annotations in microscopic images offers the best input. Unger et al. presented a method to deform microscopic images towards white light images, as tissue alterations occurred due to histopathological preparation.22 Applying this method to deform histopathological tumour segmentation towards the corresponding US images could provide a ‘gold standard’ input, potentially improving the model’s performance.
Our study has contributed to improvements in intraoperative 3D US volume segmentation of TSCC. Implementing the 3D nnUNet resulted in the fast AS of specimen and tumour segments during surgery. This reduced the total assessment time and operator-dependency. Besides training and evaluation of the model, this study has validated the clinical impact of AS on FMS. To provide real-time feedback to the surgeon, we created a 3D representation model of the specimen and tumour intraoperatively. If margins are close, the surgeon may decide to adjust the resection.
In conclusion, the 3D nnUNet yields fast AS of TSCC in 3D US volumes. Correlation between the FMS obtained from these segmentations and histopathology was lower than the moderate correlation between MS and histopathology. To further develop the model, we will investigate the registration of histopathological tumour annotations towards US images as the new ground truth for the nnUNet.

The study had full local ethics approval with a waiver of informed consent from the institutional research board of the Netherlands Cancer Institute (IRB-dm19332).","This study investigates the feasibility and clinical impact of a 3D nnUNet deep learning model for intraoperative segmentation of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) in 3D ultrasound (US) volumes. TSCC is typically treated via surgical resection with an aim for negative margins; however, close or positive margins necessitate additional adjuvant therapy. Current histopathological assessment of margins is time-intensive, which has driven interest in intraoperative methods such as US imaging. Recent developments in US imaging have allowed freehand acquisition to extend to 3D, potentially reducing tissue deformation and operator variability.

In this project, 3D US data were acquired from 27 TSCC patients using electromagnetic tracking to reconstruct volumes, resulting in 106 manually annotated datasets. The nnUNet was trained and evaluated using three prediction settings: a standard prediction (type 1), prediction with cross-validation (type 2), and prediction with cross-validation plus test-time augmentation (type 3). Key evaluation metrics included the Dice volumetric similarity (DVS), Dice surface similarity (DSS), average surface distance (ASD), and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95).

Results showed that the specimen segmentation achieved near-perfect DVS (0.99), while tumour segmentation yielded moderate accuracy (DVS ~0.64, ASD ~1.33 mm, HD95 around 6 mm). Fast segmentation was achieved with prediction type 1, though adjustments were sometimes needed for tumours with multiple islands. Although manual segmentation moderately correlated with histopathological margins, the automatic segmentation did not. The study concludes that while 3D nnUNet enables rapid intraoperative segmentation, further improvements are needed to enhance its correlation with the histopathological gold standard.","This paper investigates the use of a 3D No New U-Net (nnUNet) model for the automatic segmentation (AS) of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) in 3D ultrasound (US) volumes to improve intraoperative margin assessment. The goal is to reduce the need for adjuvant therapies by providing real-time feedback to surgeons.

The study trained, validated, and tested the nnUNet on a dataset of 106 manually annotated 3D US volumes, then clinically validated it on 16 prospective cases. Several types of AS were explored (with and without cross-validation/test-time augmentation). The AS performance was evaluated using metrics like Dice score and Hausdorff distance. The final resection margin status (FMS) based on AS and manual segmentation (MS) were compared to histopathology.

The study found that the fastest prediction type performed best. Segmentation of the specimen was highly accurate, while tumour segmentation had room for improvement. Adjusting the automatic segmentation by selecting the best island that represented the tumour improved some metrics. While MS moderately correlated with histopathology, AS did not. The authors conclude that nnUNet offers fast AS of TSCC in US volumes, with a future direction being the registration of histopathological annotations onto US images to create a more accurate training ground truth.","This study explores the use of a 3D No New U-Net (nnUNet) model for intraoperative segmentation of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) in 3D ultrasound (US) volumes to assess resection margins. The model was trained on 113 manually annotated 3D US volumes and clinically validated on 16 prospective TSCC cases. The nnUNet achieved fast and accurate automatic segmentation (AS) of both specimen and tumor regions, with a Dice volumetric similarity (DVS) score of 0.99 for specimens and 0.64 for tumors. Prediction type 1 (without cross-validation and test-time augmentation) performed best, with AS completed in 8 seconds. Adjustments to AS improved the average surface distance (ASD) for tumors, but segmentation performance did not significantly improve with more complex prediction types. Manual segmentation (MS) showed a moderate correlation with histopathology, while AS and semi-automatic segmentation (semi-AS) showed lower correlations. The study highlights the potential of 3D nnUNet for intraoperative margin assessment, reducing operator dependency and assessment time. However, further improvements are needed, such as using histopathological tumor annotations as ground truth for training, to enhance the model's accuracy and clinical utility.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) encompass a group of musculoskeletal conditions that affect the temporomandibular joints (TMJ), masticatory muscles and associated tissues.1 The Indiana University School of Dentistry TMJ Institute, established in October 2021, is a multidisciplinary clinic designed to support the management of patients with challenging TMD. Professionals from oral and maxillofacial surgery, orofacial pain, physical therapy, orthodontics, prosthodontics, comprehensive care dentistry, psychiatry and social work collaborate to create a customised, interprofessional consensus to patient care at the TMJ Institute.2 The aim of this study is to determine whether patients with TMJ dysfunction are satisfied with the quality of care received from the interprofessional approach provided by the TMJ Institute. The objective of this study is to determine the level of patient satisfaction at the Institute using a 5-Point Likert scale patient questionnaire.
Background
There is an increasing number of patients seeking treatment for TMD.1,3 Clinical presentation includes pain, impaired function, crepitus, radiographic bony changes and joint space narrowing.1 Chronic TMJ pain also affects cognitive, emotional, sensory, and behavioural reactions, which further aggravates and maintains the pain; therefore, psychosocial concerns are another catalyst for patients seeking treatment.4 Patients with TMD typically consult with their primary medical or dental providers first. They are then referred to subspecialists with an interest in orofacial pain or TMJ dysfunction; however, treatment remains controversial given the lack of evidence to support a preferred method. As is also typical for any arthritic joint in the body, management specific to the TMJ is primarily medical and surgical if more conservative treatment fails to improve symptoms. 2,3
Recent research by Greene et al has demonstrated that TMDs are complex, multi-system disorders, which indicates the need for an interprofessional, patient-centred treatment approach.5 Non-profit patient advocacy groups such as the TMJ Association and TMJ Patient-Led Roundtable in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health produced a consensus report describing eleven recommendations for improving TMD diagnosis and management. Recommendations range from developing a national research consortium focusing on translational, public health and clinical research, to improving the quality of care for TMD patients through improved risk assessment and clinical practice guidelines, professional school education, and patient education. There is currently an active movement towards interprofessional, team-based, patient-centred care models so that professionals can more effectively diagnose, treat and manage complex, chronic conditions such as TMD.5
Interprofessional care has been extensively studied in the literature; however, as demonstrated by the consensus report, there is a shift towards applying this novel concept into practice. At present, there are few functional interprofessional-based clinics due to practical limitations such as time, cost and organisation.3 At Indiana University School of Dentistry, the newly established TMJ Institute intends to challenge these limitations and represent a successful example of this type of practice. By establishing a customised, interprofessional approach to patient care, the Institute offers a ‘one-stop-shop’ for patients referred with chronic or challenging TMJ symptoms.2 The Institute is also actively engaged in contributing to the education of undergraduate dental students and residents through shadowing opportunities. Since the Institute’s opening in October 2021, it has been observed that patients present with complex dental, medical, and psychosocial clinical profiles, to which specialists in dentistry, medicine, social work and physical therapy have been able to apply their expertise.1 A team-based approach such as this creates a better understanding of a patient’s multifaceted pathology and enables patients to feel more valued by playing an active role in their own treatment planning process.2 Studies have shown that patient satisfaction and perceived healthcare service quality are increased when patients are included as contributing members on interprofessional healthcare teams.6
Methods
Clinic structure
The TMJ Institute is attended by professionals from dentistry, medicine, physical therapy and social work. The Institute operates the first Tuesday of every month. The Director of the TMJ Institute, personally triages all incoming patient referrals for eligibility. It is preferred that patients first attempt conservative treatment options before coming to the TMJ Institute. The team of healthcare professionals typically debriefs on each case in the conference room before entering the examination room and meeting the patient. A thorough history is taken and clinical examination conducted, to which multiple positive findings typically confirms a generic diagnosis of TMJ dysfunction refractory to previous treatment. Having the patient and specialists together in the same room allows the patient to ask questions and be actively involved in their diagnostic and treatment planning process. Each health care member of the team is given the opportunity to question and examine the patient in turn through the lens of their specific area of clinical interest. The healthcare team then leaves the exam room to discuss a definitive interprofessional management plan using each specialist’s expertise. The proposed care plan is relayed to the patient for their input and approval. Finally, all new patients receive the patient satisfaction questionnaire to complete before checking out. A follow-up appointment is typically scheduled 4-6 months later, whereby the patient returns to the TMJ Institute to reassess their signs and symptoms based on the management plan recommended at the first appointment. A follow-up telehealth consultation is also accessible to patients, if deemed appropriate.
Describing the structure of the TMJ Institute provides context for how a functional interprofessional clinic operates and how the questionnaire, through which the study’s data was collected, is incorporated into the workflow.
Study methodology
This study is an observational retrospective case study with approval from the Indiana University Institutional Review Board (IRBExempt -Protocol #: 14352). Data was gathered between October 2021-March 2024 from a de novo patient satisfaction questionnaire modelled after the 5-Point Likert scale (Fig. 1). Paper copies of the questionnaire were given to patients to complete anonymously after their first appointment. The completed questionnaires were stored safely in a locked cabinet.

Fig. 1 Patient satisfaction questionnaire.
The inclusion criteria were defined as patients seen at the TMJ Institute from October 2021-March 2024, and the exclusion criteria comprised children younger than 18 years old, patients for whom English is not their first language and patients who have not exhausted primary conservative treatment options, namely medication management, splint therapy, and physical therapy.
The first section of the questionnaire determined how far the patient travelled for their appointment (Fig. 2). The second section had prompts following a 5-Point Likert scale format to assess patient satisfaction after their first appointment (Fig. 3). The third section allowed the patient to provide free text written comments about their experience (Fig. 4).

Results
A total of 93 questionnaires were distributed and a total of 84 were completed and returned. Patients travelled from less than one to over 100 miles to be seen at the Institute, with 43% traveling over 50 miles (Fig. 2). ‘Strongly agree’ was the most selected response for each prompt, followed by ‘agree.’ The exception was if patients preferred to meet with each clinician individually as ‘strongly disagree’ and ‘disagree’ was the most popular response. A total of 18% of patients disagreed or were neutral towards treatment progressing in a timely manner. Two patients strongly disagreed and disagreed that smooth coordination occurred between departments. One disagreed with whether the various treatment options were fully explained (Fig. 3). Examples of positive patient comments include “Very friendly and genuine,” and “I loved the ‘Starbucks Experience’ that the TMJ Institute gave.” More constructive comments indicated that having multiple doctors in one room can be overwhelming and that a larger room would have been appreciated so that all doctors are visible to the patient rather than behind them. 48% of patients completed the free text comments section. A total of 87% were positive, 13% were constructive (Fig. 4).
If a patient answered “N/A,” “I don’t know,” or left a designated prompt blank, these responses were counted as ‘neutral’ according to the 5-Point Likert Scale. Two questionnaires were discarded from the total due to the prompts being unintentionally answered incorrectly; for example, the patient had positive commentary in the written comments section, however ‘strongly disagree’ was selected for every prompt. Seven patients neglected to fill out the ‘Distance Travelled’ section.
Discussion
Patients travelled great distances to be seen at the TMJ Institute in hopes of improving their quality of life. Studies have shown psychological and physical ailments caused by TMD exacerbate anxiety, depression, insomnia, social impairment, and reduced working capacity resulting in lower quality of life.4,7 Due to the limited number of TMD-specific interprofessional clinics in North America, access to this kind of novel, specialised care is limited. The TMJ Institute’s mission intends to challenge this narrative by providing accessible and affordable care to patients in Indiana and beyond. This clinic model is both effective and reproducible; therefore, our study aims to encourage the expansion of, and access to, TMD-specific interprofessional clinics across North America.
The second part of the questionnaire revealed that the only category where ‘strongly disagree’ and ‘disagree’ were most selected was whether patients preferred to meet with each clinician separately. This indicates that an interprofessional approach was preferred over a traditional, siloed healthcare model.3,4,5 Although ‘strongly agree’ was the most selected response, the few prompts that patients ‘disagreed’ with indicate areas requiring improvement. Based on these data, the TMJ Institute intends to implement more streamlined systems for executing treatment plans, improving role clarity among providers and communicating more clearly with patients.
The comments section of the questionnaire demonstrated that patients diagnosed with TMJ dysfunction were highly satisfied with the interprofessional approach used at the Institute, as evidenced by 87% of the comments being positive. Our findings emphasise that positive patient satisfaction is an important factor in assessing the quality and efficacy of interprofessional, patient-centred models.
Conclusion
Considering the current climate of TMD diagnosis and management, the opening of the TMJ Institute as one of few functional interprofessional clinics for TMD in North America is both significant and timely. The founders and providers of the TMJ Institute aim to provide comprehensive, contemporary and collaborative care for all TMJ patients in Indiana and beyond. By combining the knowledge of experts in multiple healthcare disciplines, to applying translational research from the current scientific literature, the TMJ Institute strives to be the gold standard clinic model for the multidisciplinary management of patients with TMD through accessible, affordable and evidence-based care.2

Since their introduction, dental implants have transformed dentistry and become a widely accepted solution for missing teeth.1 Extensive research has demonstrated high long-term success and survival rates for implants in the general population2,3, with 90-95% success reported across diverse clinical situations and patient groups4–7. However, certain factors can increase the risk of implant failure and reduce success rates. Identifying these factors is crucial for both dental professionals and patients to make informed treatment decisions and ensure the best possible long-term outcomes. The success of dental implants depends on osseointegration which is the connection between the implant surface and the vital bone.8 Bone metabolism, encompassing bone formation and remodeling, is vital for successful osseointegration.8 Disruptions in bone metabolism can negatively affect osseointegration, leading to implant failure.8 Factors such as age, gender, smoking, implant dimensions, bone augmentation, and certain medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been implicated in influencing bone metabolism and potentially compromising implant success.9,10
PPIs are commonly used to treat and prevent peptic ulcers, manage gastroesophageal reflux disease, and, in combination with antibiotics, eradicate Helicobacter pylori infections.11 PPIs are also commonly prescribed following surgical procedures to mitigate chronic pain and prevent adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the digestive system.12 The use of PPIs has been linked to several potential adverse effects, raising concerns about their safety. These include an increased risk of fractures, particularly in the hip and spine, as well as impaired bone regeneration and healing.13,14 An experimental study conducted on rats demonstrated that PPIs can negatively impact osseointegration, primarily by reducing the number of osteoclasts.10
Research on the association between PPIs and dental implant treatment outcome has yielded conflicting results. A study by Chrcanovic et al. found that PPI intake was statistically associated with a higher risk of implant failure.15 Another study by Altay and colleagues supports this finding.16 PPIs users had 4.6 times higher odds of experiencing implant failure compared to those not taking PPIs.16 In contrast, a retrospective cohort study of 933 implants in 284 patients investigated the impact of long-term PPI use on dental implant failure and peri-implantitis and found no significant correlation between PPI use and either implant failure or peri-implantitis.17 Similarly, in a clinical study of 240 randomly selected patients from a university clinic, PPIs were found to have a protective effect against the development of peri-implantitis.18
The evidence between PPIs and implant treatment outcome is limited and currently available from relatively small and short-term studies. The aim of this retrospective large-scale study was to investigate long-term the association between PPI and the risk of dental implant failure. The hypothesis of the present investigation was that due to the negative effect of PPIs on bone metabolism, their use will be associated with increased risk of dental implant failure.
Material and Methods
This retrospective study analyzed data from patients who received dental implants at various university dental clinics participating in the BigMouth network, including Harvard University; University of Texas Health; The University of California, San Francisco; University of Colorado; Loma Linda University; University of Buffalo; The University of Iowa; The University of Minnesota; Tufts University between 2011 and 2022.
Dental records of adult patients who received dental treatment at participating universities in the BigMouth network between 2011 and 2022 were examined. Current Dental Terminology (CDT) codes, a standardized system developed by the American Dental Association (ADA), were utilized to identify patients with dental implants. The initial screening included patients who received comprehensive or periodic oral evaluations (D0150, D0120 or D0180), followed by identification of those with missing teeth (partially or totally edentulous) who received at least one dental implant (using CDT code D6010: surgical placement of implant body: endosteal implant).
Data were extracted and validated from the electronic health records by independent data analysts. Information regarding patients’ characteristics including age; gender; ethnicity; race; tobacco use; and intake of PPIs were extracted from patients’ files. Six PPIs were evaluated including dexlansoprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole. Implant failure was defined as the removal of a dental implant for any reason and was determined by reviewing electronic dental records and patient charts, specifically using the CDT D6010 code.
Statistical analysis
Patient demographics and characteristics were described using means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Time to failure in months (date of procedure to date of visit with failure) were recorded, while sites without a failure were censored at the last follow-up visit. At implant level, Kaplan–Meier plots for the survival of all PPIs were created and hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported for the Cox regression model. At the patient-level, Fisher exact test and logistic regression analysis for the variables that reached the level of significance were performed. A statistical software program was used for analysis, with a significance level of 0.05 SPSS v.29.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

Patient-level findings
The univariate analysis on the association between PPI intake and no PPI intake with the risk of implant failure at the patient level (PPI users and non-users) is demonstrated in Table 2. Out of the 20,274 patients who were included in the analysis, 568 of them exhibited an implant failure which leads to an implant failure rate of 2.7%. The use of pantoprazole (p < 0.001), omeprazole (p < 0.001) as well as the use of PPI in general (p = 0.03) were statistically significant associated to the implant treatment outcome. A protective effect of pantoprazole was noted in regards to implant treatment outcome. The level of significance was not reached in the regression analysis (p = 0.99). Omeprazole intake was statistically significant (p<0.001) associated with implant failure. Regression analysis revealed that omeprazole users exhibited 1.77 (95% CI: 1.30-2.42) odds of experiencing implant loss compared to non-users (p<0.001). Overall, at the patient-level, the use of PPIs was significantly associated with implant loss (p=0.03) with PPI users demonstrating 1.40 (95% CI: 1.04-1.88) odds of having an implant failure (p=0.03).

Implant site characteristics
At the implant level, out of 50,333 dental implants included in the present investigation over a mean follow-up time of 83.86 (SD: 57.57) months (minimum: 0 and maximum: 367 months), 725 failed, leading to an implant failure rate of 1.4%. More than half of the included implants were placed in the maxilla (53.5%) and in posterior regions (71.8%). In total, 2,872 (5.8%) of the included implants were placed in PPI users. The univariate analysis on the association between PPI intake and no PPI intake with the risk of implant failure at implant level (implants placed in PPI users and non-users) is shown in Table 3. Statistically significant associations were detected between implant treatment outcome and implants placed in pantoprazole (p <0.001) users as well as omeprazole (p = 0.01) users. None of the other PPIs were statistically associated with the treatment outcome.

Survival analysis
The Kaplan-Meier curves comparing the cumulative survival of implants placed in pantoprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, dexlansiprazole, rabeprazole and in PPI users compared to non-users are shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1A-F. The mean survival time for implants placed in PPI users was 339.96 months as compared to 358.27 months in non-users (p=0.33). Implants placed in pantoprazole users showed a significant protection against implant loss (p=0.01), while implants in omeprazole users demonstrated a significant (p=0.02) lower survival time (338.17 months) compared to non-users (358.38 months). No significant differences were observed in regards to the survival rates of the other PPIs. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that implants placed in omeprazole users exhibited a significantly higher hazard ratio (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.07-1.96) compared to those placed in non-users (p=0.02). None of the other PPIs reached the level of significance.

Discussion
The present retrospective study aimed to investigate long-term the association between PPIs and the risk of dental implant failure. For this purpose, a large-scale, retrospective study was performed utilizing a large dataset named BigMouth Dental Data Repository. The effect of PPI use on implant treatment outcome remains a subject of debate within implant dentistry due to the limited available evidence and the conflicting results in the literature. A recent systematic review of the literature concluded that due to the limited number of studies on the topic; more research, particularly clinical trials, is needed to determine the definitive relationship between PPI use and dental implant failure.19 Similarly, the need for further research to determine the extent of the relationship between PPI user and implant survival was highlighted in a systematic review that reported a negative impact of PPIs in dental implant survival based on limited available research.20 Another recent review reported that the literature on the association between PPI use and implant failure is inconsistent and further research, particularly to determine whether impaired bone metabolism is directly caused by PPIs or other confounding factors, is crucial.21 In addition, the authors recommended that the use of PPIs after implant placement should be carefully evaluated and limited if possible.21
Moreover, a systematic review emphasized the lack of high-quality studies, and they suggested a positive association between PPI use and soft tissue attachment levels around teeth.22 In contrast, PPI use seems to have a predominantly negative, albeit variable, effect on bone levels around dental implants.22 The need for additional well-designed studies was also reported in another umbrella review.23 Furthermore, another systematic review concluded that although PPI usage appears to negatively impact the success of dental implants, this association requires further investigation as existing studies have not adequately controlled for potential confounding factors.24 In a nested case-control study that utilized electronic medical records of failed implants, it was found that patients who experienced implant failure were more likely to have consumed PPIs within 6 months of the implant surgery.25 In addition, a retrospective cohort study reported a statistically significant 1.91-fold increased odds of early implant failure were found in patients using PPIs.26 In agreement with the previous results, a retrospective study concluded that there is a 0.59 mm significant difference between PPI and non-PPI users in regards to crestal bone loss and following adjustment of systemic factors, a significant difference of 0.83 mm was reported.27 Therefore, PPI intake was associated with increased loss of crestal bone around implants.27
In addition, patients using PPIs exhibited a 2.811 times higher risk of implant failure compared to those not taking PPIs in a study that included 999 consecutively treated patients between 1980 and 2014 with implant-supported/retained prostheses at one specialist clinic.15 Similar findings were reported by Wu and colleagues in a retrospective cohort study with 1,773 implants.28 PPI users were found to have a 2.73 times higher risk of dental implant failure compared to those who did not use these medications.28 The findings of the present investigation are in agreement with the majority of the published studies. The significant association between omeprazole users and non-users in regards to dental implant survival might be attributed to the lower bone to implant contact, the reduced newly formed bone, the lower peri-implant bone volume, and the type of bone (woven and lamellar) observed in omeprazole users.10,29
In contrast, different findings have been reported in a limited number of studies. A university-representative cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of peri-implant diseases and aimed to identify risk and protective indicators of peri-implantitis that included 240 randomly selected patients and they reported a protective effect of PPI use against peri-implantitis.18 In the present study analysis, implants placed in pantoprazole users showed a significant protection against implant loss (p=0.01) and no implant failures occurred with the pantoprazole users group. This could be attributed to the anti-inflammatory properties of this medication.17 Another study of 1,118 implants followed-up for 5.19 ± 4.22 years concluded that there was no significant effect of PPI on implant survival when patient level analysis was performed.30 Similarly, a study by Altay et al. found that the correlation between PPI consumption and implant failure was significant at the implant level but not significant at the patient level.16 Also, a retrospective cohort study of patients who received dental implant treatment showed there was no independent association between PPI use and implant failure or peri-implantitis when controlling for confounding factors.17
This retrospective study has limitations due to potential variability in implant placement techniques across different clinicians and institutions, despite standardized protocols. Additionally, important factors like bone quality, implant surface, and surgeon experience were not considered. The study relied solely on patient records, preventing a full evaluation of implant success and surrounding tissues. However, the study's strengths include its large dataset from multiple university dental clinics and its notably long follow-up period, enhancing the validity of findings. Future prospective studies are needed to establish a definitive cause-and-effect relationship between PPI intake and implant failure, considering confounding factors and details regarding PPI use. A previous study of our group that utilized data from the same cohort of patients examined the records of 20,842 patients who received 50,333 dental implants at ten dental universities.31 Our previous work aimed to determine the long-term implant failure rate and identify associated patient-related factors.31 The study did not find any statistically significant link between implant failure and systemic medical conditions. This dataset did not include information on the reasons for PPI prescription or the presence of comorbidities that may influence both PPI choice and implant outcomes (e.g., diabetes, immunodeficiencies, use of antiresorptive drugs). In addition, no detailed information on certain medical conditions known to influence implant outcomes, such as bisphosphonate use, history of radiotherapy, vascular changes, and uncontrolled diabetes was available. The study highlights the need for future research to investigate the complex interplay between PPI use, patient-specific factors, and implant survival. Further studies with detailed information on indications for PPI use, comorbid conditions, and medication history are crucial to fully elucidate the observed associations and inform clinical practice.
Conclusions
Within the limitations of this retrospective large-scale study that utilized records of 50,333 dental implants placed in ten institutions contributing data to the BigMouth network, omeprazole was significantly associated with implant failure both at patient and implant levels. At the patient level, PPI users demonstrated a significantly higher risk of experiencing dental implant failure.

Dental implants generally show high success rates (90–95%), but factors influencing osseointegration, such as bone metabolism disruptions, may compromise outcomes. PPIs—widely prescribed for gastrointestinal disorders and postoperative care—have been linked to adverse bone effects, including increased fracture risk and impaired bone healing, raising concerns about their potential impact on implant success.

The study extracted detailed patient data using standardized dental codes from the BigMouth Dental Data Repository. Key patient characteristics included a mean age of 57.5 years, a slight female majority, and a minority (6.4%) reporting PPI use. Specific PPIs evaluated were pantoprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, dexlansoprazole, and rabeprazole. At the patient level, a 2.7% implant failure rate was observed, with PPI users showing a significantly higher risk of implant failure (odds ratio 1.40) compared to non-users. At the implant level, failure was noted in 1.4% of cases, with omeprazole users demonstrating a 1.77 times increased likelihood of failure and reduced survival times, as revealed by Kaplan–Meier analyses. Conversely, implants in pantoprazole users appeared to have a protective effect. The study acknowledges limitations such as variations in clinical techniques and incomplete clinical data, and calls for future prospective research to further elucidate the complex interplay between PPI use and implant outcomes.","This retrospective study investigated the long-term association between Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) use and dental implant failure using data from 20,274 patients who received 50,333 implants across multiple university dental clinics between 2011 and 2022. The study aimed to address conflicting findings in previous research regarding PPIs' impact on osseointegration and implant success.

The results revealed an overall implant failure rate of 2.7% at the patient level and 1.4% at the implant level. Notably, omeprazole was significantly associated with increased implant failure at both levels, while pantoprazole showed a protective effect against implant loss. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed that implants in omeprazole users had a significantly lower survival time, and Cox regression analysis indicated a higher hazard ratio for implant failure in this group.

The authors concluded that omeprazole use is significantly associated with implant failure, and PPI users, in general, have a higher risk of implant failure. They acknowledge limitations, including variability in implant placement techniques and the reliance on patient records.

Head and neck cancer
Head and neck cancer (HNC) refers to malignancies found in mucosal surfaces anywhere from the paranasal sinuses to the larynx, including the various glands and cavities. It is the eighth most common cancer in the UK and accounts for 3% of new cancer cases. Its incidence has seen a dramatic 34% surge since the 1990s, with nearly 12,400 cases every year, about 34 new diagnoses each day. Between the years 2016 and 2018, there were about 3900 new cases every year in women and 8600 in men, making it the thirteenth most common cancer in women and fourth most common in men.1
A substantial majority of HNCs are squamous cell carcinomas (SCC).2 The development of HNC is multifactorial with influences from both the environment and genetics.
Environmental factors such as tobacco and alcohol consumption have cumulative effects and account for 75% of cases. Significant alcohol intake can make an individual vulnerable to HNSCC, even in non-smokers,2 although factors such as obesity and diabetes have not been shown to increase the risk.3,4
Associations have also been made between human papillomavirus (HPV) and HNC. HPV type 16 and type 18 infections have a role in oropharyngeal cancers, especially tonsillar cancer.5
UK medical school curriculum
The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) has set forth a comprehensive set of overarching outcomes for medical students, including how to deal with HNC. These outcomes ensure that medical students will gain the knowledge and competencies to effectively diagnose, treat, and manage HNCs.6 Moreover, the RCS states that the outcomes will aid medical graduates to make informed career choices by gaining a basic understanding of surgery. The outcomes include skills that range from the identification of surgical emergencies to the ability to recognise and understand common surgical conditions, including those specific to HNC. In the undergraduate curriculum the RCS lists 35 key conditions that are essential for all medical graduates, including:
•        
Knowledge of oesophageal cancer risk factors, presentations, and medical and surgical management.
•        
Knowledge of the aetiology and pathology of common neck lumps.
•        
The ability to identify lumps that need urgent/non-urgent referral to ear, nose and throat (ENT) and those that do not need referral.
•        
Being able to recognise red-flag symptoms such as dysphagia, hoarseness of voice, and throat/mouth/neck pain.
To achieve these outcomes, students need to have a good understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the head and neck. However, a study found that anatomy teaching has declined in UK medical schools.7 Another study found that most junior doctors in emergency medicine felt unable to identify basic head and neck anatomy.8 Due to these educational gaps and possibly poor clinical exposure to HNC, a study was warranted to explore and investigate medical education and its alignment with the RCS outcomes. To our knowledge, no recent literature has assessed the knowledge of HNC in undergraduate final year medical students in the UK.
The aim of our study therefore was to evaluate the amount and type of teaching that UK medical students receive on HNC, and to assess their current knowledge of these cancers.
Method
This was a cross sectional cohort study that used an online survey (https://www.onlinesurveys.ac.uk) to collect data (Appendix A). All final year medical students at a UK medical school who will graduate in 2024 were included.
The survey questions were initially created by the lead researcher using previous literature with similar aims, and guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE).9 Questions were then reviewed by surgical trainees before distribution.
The survey questions were split into two key domains, the first being knowledge of HNC regarding risk factors, histological subtypes, and ‘red-flag’ symptoms. The second section focused on the students’ perception of their teaching, and their exposure to HNC within their medical school curriculum and placements.
Prior to distribution of the survey nationally, the questions were piloted on a smaller group of medical students from University College London (UCL). Feedback was then obtained regarding the clarity of the questions and changes were made accordingly.
For distribution nationally, medical students from 19 different UK medical schools were recruited as ‘university representatives’ to distribute the survey among the final year medical students at their university. The survey was open to responses for three weeks. All responses were anonymous, as no identifiable data were collected.
Survey results were then exported to Microsoft Excel and analysed.
No ethics approval was required.
Results
Group demographics
A total of 384 UK medical students from 25 medical schools responded to the survey. Of all the respondents, 311 were final year medical students (Fig. 1). The 73 non-final year responses were excluded from the statistical analysis.

Knowledge of head and neck cancer
Regarding knowledge of HNC, 244 (78.5%) final year respondents correctly identified squamous as the most common subtype (Fig. 2). Regarding considerations for a two-week wait referral, ‘persistent and unexplained lump in the neck’ was the most correctly identified red-flag symptom, with 300 (96.5%) identifying it. ‘A lump on the lip’ was the least identified red-flag symptom, with 150 (48.2%) identifying it. A further breakdown of the results can be seen in Table 1.

Teaching and exposure
Regarding teaching on HNC, 72 students (23.2%) reported receiving no teaching at their medical school. Of the 239 who reported receiving teaching, 169 (54.3%) received it in the format of a non-interactive large group lecture (Fig. 3). When rating their satisfaction of HNC, 120 (38.6%) reported an extent of dissatisfaction, 119 (38.2%) were neutral, and 72 satisfied.

Fig. 3 Response to the question “What format was the HNC teaching (if you received any)?”.
A total of 271 respondents (87.1%) believed that medical students at their university would benefit from more teaching on HNC. Five (1.6%) disagreed, and the remaining 35 (11.3%) were unsure if there would be a benefit. Eighty-eight final year medical students (28.3%) reported being confident in their knowledge of HNC. A total of 125 (40.2%) reported not feeling confident, the remaining respondents were neutral.
A total of 121 students (38.9%) did not feel confident about how they would physically examine a patient, 103 (33.1%) felt confident, the remaining respondents were neutral.
Regarding understanding of what warrants a two-week wait referral for HNC, 163 respondents (52.4%) reported being confident, 82 (26.4%) reported feeling ‘unconfident’, and the remaining 67 (21.5%) were unsure.
A total of 78 (25.1%) final-year respondents reported being involved in the care of at least one HNC patient during their placement. One hundred and seventy-eight (57.2%) reported having no involvement in the care of a HNC patient throughout medical school. The remaining 59 (19.0%) were unsure whether they had been involved or not.
Discussion
Based on our sample, there appears to be an overall dissatisfaction and lack of confidence surrounding HNC in the undergraduate curriculum. Regarding what can be done to improve knowledge and awareness, it would be unreasonable to assume that all medical schools can make oncology and/or OMFS placements longer, as this may in turn have a negative impact on other placements. We should therefore look at how existing teaching and placements can be improved, and what non-placement activities can be carried out.
Our results raised interesting questions when considering the usual teaching methods for HNC education. We have reported that the majority of HNC content is delivered through large, mostly non-interactive lectures, with more personal teaching approaches such as ward-based teaching and seminars following behind in much lower proportions. Whilst universities have largely moved to delivering many of their lectures online since the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to consider what effective teaching entails, what students prefer, and whether this large group lecture format offers high-quality HNC teaching and exposure.
When looking at literature regarding oncology education in general (rather than just HNC), it has been reported that oncology conferences, cancer patient panels, and patient interaction workshops further improved the confidence of medical students in their communication skills, medical knowledge, and emotional coping strategies.10 With the majority of students in our study reporting that they had never been involved in the care of a HNC patient, panels like this can be incredibly useful.
It has also been reported that UK medical students see oncology as a challenging specialty, and they have an average of one to two weeks’ exposure (recommended 2–3 weeks) during their entire undergraduate medical training.10 This leads to low confidence in oncology skills, dissatisfaction with teaching, and a lack of interest in pursuing the specialty after graduation.10 Although foundation year (FY) doctors attribute good communication skills and clinical knowledge to managing cancer patients, they feel underprepared for oncology allocations due to rapidly evolving specialist knowledge and lack of specific oncology teaching.11 The same study reported that 62% of FY doctors would have preferred to have more oncologist-led teaching activities during medical school concerning symptom control with chemoradiotherapy and the management of oncological emergencies, and would have preferred greater involvement of cancer patients teaching about patient perspectives.11 Our results echo this dissatisfaction.
A study also showed that in comparison with dentistry students, medical students report lower rates of routine examination of the oral cavity, less confidence in their knowledge, and would only examine if high-risk factors were identified.12 When considering referral pathways for suspected oral cancer patients, medical students would be more likely to refer patients to the dentist, as opposed to directly referring to oral medicine and surgery departments.12
Our results reflect this uncertainty among medical students about when to refer patients to the suspected cancer pathway. Overall, respondents were less sure about referral for symptoms relating more to the oral cavity, such as erythroleukoplakia, rather than the neck. The real-world implication of this is that it can delay the process of diagnosis and management, which in turn may reduce patient satisfaction and outcome success.12 The reason why symptoms of the neck may have been more correctly identified as red flags over oral symptoms is due to this being more related to ENT, and because just below a quarter of our respondents said they were considering a career in ENT. Clinical rotations in specialties such as oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS), plastic surgery, or clinical oncology may offer medical students opportunities for clinical education about oral cancer. Whilst undergraduate exposure to OMFS has been reportedly low, a collaborative approach between the specialty and medical school can allow for sufficient exposure and/or teaching.13
Another possible way to integrate more HNC education is through medical school portfolios. These have been reported to improve student performances in oncology-related examination, and 90% of students found the process valuable due to the reflective component based on patient interactions, photographs of the case, and narrative around the cancer journey.14 The same study also emphasised that medical students who received teaching from patients improved their empathy in communication with patients, which led to the expression of favourable attitudes when dealing with cancer patients.14 Regarding our reported overall lack of confidence about examining HNC patients, manikin-based teaching sessions may be useful.
Undergraduate medical education has the ability to empower medical students and provide solid foundations for the rest of their careers, regardless of what specialty they finally choose. In particular, regarding HNC with its increasing prevalence in the UK, it is vital that red-flag symptoms and referral criteria are understood by the future medical workforce.
Limitations
Limitations of the study include the sample size and the fact that not all UK universities were represented in the respondent cohort. There is also possible bias in that those who answered the survey may have been interested in head and neck oncology and therefore may have had additional knowledge and experience beyond their medical school curriculum (Fig. 4). We also acknowledge that as this survey was electronically distributed, some may have looked up information online to answer the questions about referral and risk factors for HNC, although we asked respondents not to use external resources.

Fig. 4 Response to the question “Do you intend to have a career in any of the following specialties?”.
Further studies should work with educational teams at UK medical schools to ensure all universities can be assessed. These studies could also possibly include first-year medical students, and results between first and final-year students could be compared.

Not applicable.","Head and neck cancer (HNC) encompasses malignancies of the mucosal surfaces from the paranasal sinuses to the larynx, with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) being the predominant subtype. Representing 3% of new cancer cases in the UK and having seen a 34% incidence increase since the 1990s, HNC poses significant clinical challenges. This research project evaluates the extent and effectiveness of HNC education among final-year UK medical students in relation to Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) curricular outcomes.

The study employed a cross-sectional survey distributed online to final-year students graduating in 2024 from 19 UK medical schools, gathering 384 responses (311 from final-year students). The survey assessed knowledge of HNC risk factors, red-flag symptoms, histological subtypes, and the students’ perceptions of their educational exposure. While the majority correctly identified key risk factors such as tobacco use and recognized essential red-flag symptoms like persistent neck lumps, a significant proportion demonstrated uncertainty, particularly regarding oral symptoms. Most teaching was delivered via non-interactive lectures, and about one-quarter of respondents reported receiving no HNC education at all. Consequently, many students lacked confidence in patient examination, referral decisions, and overall HNC management.

The findings reveal clear educational deficiencies that could delay diagnosis and adversely affect patient outcomes. The study suggests that augmenting traditional lectures with interactive teaching methods, enhanced clinical exposure, and patient-centered learning could bridge these gaps. Future research should explore innovative curricular strategies to improve HNC education, ensuring that graduates are better prepared to manage this increasingly prevalent disease. This study provides important insights.","This research paper investigates the knowledge and teaching of head and neck cancer (HNC) among final-year UK medical students. HNC incidence is rising, yet the study reveals significant gaps in medical education. A cross-sectional survey of 311 students from 25 UK medical schools assessed their knowledge of HNC risk factors, subtypes, and red-flag symptoms, alongside their perception of HNC teaching and clinical exposure.

Results show that while students generally identified squamous cell carcinoma as the most common subtype and recognized some red-flag symptoms (e.g., neck lumps), knowledge of oral cavity symptoms and certain risk factors (e.g., diabetes) was lacking. A concerning 23.2% reported receiving no HNC teaching, and the majority received it through non-interactive lectures. Most students felt they would benefit from more HNC teaching, lacked confidence in their knowledge and examination skills, and had limited clinical exposure to HNC patients. The authors suggest improving existing teaching methods, incorporating patient panels, and exploring portfolio-based learning and manikin-based examination training to enhance HNC education in medical school, emphasizing the importance of early and accurate diagnosis due to the increasing prevalence of HNC.","This study evaluates the knowledge and teaching of head and neck cancer (HNC) among final-year medical students in the UK, using an online survey completed by 311 students from 25 medical schools. Results revealed significant gaps in knowledge, with only 78.5% correctly identifying squamous cell carcinoma as the most common HNC subtype. While 96.5% recognized a persistent neck lump as a red-flag symptom, only 48.2% identified a lip lump as concerning. Tobacco smoking was the most recognized risk factor (98.1%), but diabetes was the least (43.4%). Teaching on HNC was predominantly delivered through non-interactive lectures, with 23.2% reporting no teaching at all. Many students expressed dissatisfaction with HNC education, and 87.1% believed more teaching was needed. Confidence in examining HNC patients and understanding referral criteria was low, with 40.2% feeling unconfident in their knowledge and 38.9% unsure about physical examination. Only 25.1% had been involved in caring for HNC patients during placements. The study highlights the need for improved HNC education, suggesting interactive teaching methods, patient panels, and increased clinical exposure to enhance student confidence and knowledge. Addressing these gaps is crucial given the rising incidence of HNC in the UK and the importance of early diagnosis and referral. Limitations include potential response bias and the lack of representation from all UK medical schools.

With the improvement of medical technology, dental implant therapy has become a common alternative treatment option for repairing missing teeth with predictable long-term outcomes.1 A study2 including a total of 3973 patients with 5404 implants demonstrated that the cumulative survival rates of implants at one, five, and 10 years were 99.6%, 98.9%, and 98.7%, respectively. However, the phenomenon of implant failure still exists. The aetiopathogenesis of dental implant loss is multifactorial.3 It is universally acknowledged4,5 that an implant exhibiting clinical movement before the installation of a final prosthesis (early loss) may be linked to systemic diseases such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, poor bone quality and quantity, lack of primary stability, and surgical trauma. Abutment screw and/or implant fractures, often along with fistulas and hyperplastic mucositis, may be associated with excessive implant loading (greater than the bone can bear), bruxism, and traumatic occlusion.
Often, dental implant loss caused by peri-implantitis or infection may be avoidable. In the eyes of patients, the one-year implant loss following a surgical procedure is probably of greater concern than implants presenting late loss. So, it may be reasonable to question what affects one-year implant loss and late implant loss in patients for whom the loss is the result of peri-implantitis or infection. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the local factors that are likely to be associated with one-year implant loss and late implant loss.
Material and methods
Study design and sample
To address the research objective, a retrospective study was designed and implemented. The study population was composed of all the patients who presented at the authors’ hospital for implant-prosthodontic therapy due to a dentition defect, and who then underwent an implant loss or removal, between January 2011 and December 2022. This study was confirmed by the Ethics Committee of the Hefei Stomatology Hospital, China (Y20220106), and performed following the Declaration of Helsinki II protocol.
The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 years or older who had one or more implant losses caused by peri-implantitis or infection rather than poor osseointegration and mechanical complications after prosthesis loading. Peri-implantitis refers to inflammation that occurs in the mucosa around the implant. This condition can cause various symptoms such as pain, swollen lymph nodes, an uncomfortable feeling, bleeding, movement of the affected implant, and bone loss visible through a radiographic examination. Poor osseointegration refers to implant loss that occurs 3-6 months after implant placement and before the restoration of a final prosthesis, which is frequently combined with inconspicuous bone loss. The exclusion criteria were as follows:
(1)        
patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,
(2)        
patients with a history of bisphosphonate therapy,
(3)        
subjects suffering from cancer requiring chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination,
(4)        
patients having poor oral hygiene and/or periodontal disease (the presence of food particles and dental calculus in the patient's oral cavity, as well as redness or bleeding on probing around healthy teeth, are signs of poor oral hygiene), and
(5)        
patients without adequate information.
Variables and data collection methods
Patient demographic data and surgical or implant variables were obtained from their files. The predictor variables or potential confounders included sex, age, implant location (Maxilla/Mandible and Anterior /Posterior), the timing of implant placement.6 (Immediate: on the same day of tooth extraction, Early: with a healing duration of 1–4 months after tooth extraction, and Delayed:>4 months), the timing of prosthesis loading.6 (Early: implants were connected to the prosthesis ≤ 2 months after implant placement, and Late: >2 months), bone augmentation (including maxillary sinus lifting, autogenous bone or biomaterial graft, guided bone regeneration, and alveolar bone splitting), smoking habits, implant diameter (Narrow: ≤3.5 mm, Regular: 3.6–4.5 mm, and Wide: >4.5 mm), implant length (≤10 mm, >10 mm), healing process (Embedded and Emerged), and implant type (Soft tissue level and Bone level). The primary outcome measurement was the occurrence of one-year dental implant loss. The one-year implant loss was defined as the time in situ and functional, which was less than one year from prosthesis loading to implant removal or loss and that more than at least one year was classified as late implant loss.
Data analyses
The statistical analysis of predictor variables was stepwise conducted. The chi-squared test was used to identify the potential risk factors (categorical data) for the occurrence of one-year implant loss and then the predictors with a p value less than 0.05 were entered into generalised estimating equations (GEE). The results of the variables were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The GEE was performed here since more than one implant was lost or had to be removed from the same patients. The demographic description was based on the number of patients, while the predictor variables were analysed based on the number of implants. Statistical analysis of all data was performed using SPSS 25 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corp). A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
A total number of 13629 implants in 8707 patients were documented during the period between January 2011 and December 2022. The overall implant failure rate was 2.7% (373/13629) on the implant level and 4.1% (357/8707) on the patient level, respectively. The mean (SD) implant survival time, based on all the lost implants, was 26.8 (1.7) months, with a range of 1-193 months from implant placement up to implant removal or loss.
Demographic characteristics of the included patients
During the study, 357 patients were screened for eligibility. Finally, a total of 279 patients with 287 failed implants were enrolled in this study (Fig 1). There were 200 (71.7%, 200/279) male and 79 (28.3%, 79/279) female with a mean (SD) age of 45.17 (12.76) years. Two implants failed in eight patients, whereas the remaining patients lost single implants. One hundred and fifty-two patients (54.5%, 152/279) were smokers, of which most (68 cases, 44.7%, 68/152) were aged 41–60 years, followed by 18–40 years (34.9%, 53/152) and older than 60 years (20.4%, 31/152). Of the 279 patients, 155 (55.6%, 155/279) patients had implants placed in the mandibular region and bone augmentation was performed in 46 (16.5%, 46/279) patients. One hundred and fourteen patients underwent a one-year implant loss, accounting for 40.9% (114/279) of the whole failed implants. (Table 1).

The associations between the investigated variables and one-year implant loss.
Open table in a new tab
The percentage of one-year failed implants in the mandibular anterior and maxillary anterior regions were 85.2% (23/27) and 62.9% (22/35), respectively, which had a higher percentage of implant loss than 32.6% (30/92) in the maxillary posterior region and 31.6% (42/133) in the mandibular posterior region (p < 0.001).
The percentage of one-year implant loss between implants placed simultaneously and implants with a delayed placement were significantly different with implants placed simultaneously exhibiting a higher loss percentage of 76.9% (10/13) during the first year (p < 0.001).
The percentage of one-year implant loss for implant loading during a bone healing period of fewer than two months presented a higher loss percentage of 84.8% (67/79) than that for late implant loading (p < 0.001).
There appeared to be a trend toward a higher percentage of one-year implant loss (56.8%,67/118) in the narrow diameter group and that would reduce as the implant diameter enlarged (p < 0.001). (Table 2). Finally, implant location, the timing of implant placement, the timing of loading, implant diameter, and smoking were chosen for further analysis, considering the result of a meta-analysis4 that has shown thatsmoking was a strong predictor of implant failure.
Multivariate analysis for risk factors associated with one-year implant loss
The ORs of the investigated predictors were from the GEE as shown in Table 3. After multivariate analysis control to the potential confounders, a statistically significant associationwith the percentage of one-year implant loss was observed concerning the timing of implant placement (p = 0.001) and timing of implant loading (p < 0.001).Immediate implant placement exhibited 3.373 (95% CI: 1.652 to 6.886) significantly increased risks to experience one-year implant loss than early and delayed implant placement (p = 0.001). In addition, implants loaded within a healing period fewer than two months after implant placement were at 18.139 (95% CI: 8.925 to 36.866) significantly higher risks to one-year implant failure when compared with implants that were loaded within more than two months after implant placement (p < 0.001). Smokers were 1.866 (OR = 1.866,95% CI: 0.993 to 3.510) times as high a risk of implant one-year failure as non-smokers, but there were no significant differences (p = 0.053). Immediate implant placement and early implant loading were considered risk factors for one-year implant loss.

Discussion
A study including 423 lost implants in 236 patients has reported that approximately 76.8% of the failed implants were lost in the first year.7 Similarly, another retrospective study demonstrated that the majority of the failed implants in sinus-grafted patients were removed within the first nine months (85.7%).8 On the contrary, in the present study, only 40.8% of the failed implants were removed during the first year, which is similar to a previously reported finding, suggesting that 38.3% of the failed implants were lost within one year.9 The discrepancy existed partly because the failed implants in patients with poor osseointegration (before prosthesis loading) and mechanical complications were excluded to evaluate the effect of timing of loading on the one-year implant loss.
Implant placement and loading
Similar to our study, another10 reported that immediate implant placement following tooth extraction was associated with implant early loss. In addition, the risk of implant loss was 4.72 times higher in patients who underwent simultaneous implant placement and ridge augmentation than that in those without simultaneous implant placement.8 In agreement with our findings, a study11 compared the marginal bone loss following immediately loaded implants and conventionally loaded implants, and concluded that there was statistically significantly more marginal bone loss following immediate loading protocol indicative of future problems. In contrast, in a paper including 3827 (20.2%) implants that were immediately loaded, there were no significant differences between immediately loaded implants with a failure rate of 2.7% and delayed loaded implants with a failure rate of 2.1%.7 These results could be explained by the fact that bone turnover may deteriorate implant stability during the healing period,12 and early implant loading may cause implant micromotions exceeding the threshold value of primary implant stability and disturb osseointegration by enveloping the implant in fibrous tissue. Moreover, to obtain enough primary implant stability, our surgeons were inclined to place implants employing an under-drilling technique, which leads to a higher torque during the final phase of implant insertion, but this higher torque will result in the occurrence of marginal bone loss and implant failure.13 Taking osseointegration into consideration, it has been recommended that implant placement should be completed first and allow a period of recovery and healing before implant loading.
Smoking
Other studies8,14 and a meta-analysis4 have shown thatsmoking was a strong predictor of implant failure, especially for late implant failure.15 On the contrary, a retrospective study of 5404 dental implants described by Shen et al 2 indicated that when compared with non-smokers,smokers are not associated with the cumulative survival rate of implants in patients who underwent implant placement with simultaneous guided bone regeneration, after accounting for other potential confounding factors. Furthermore, Schwarz et al16 failed to find conclusive evidence that smoking contributes to developing peri-implantitis. In addition,we did not observe significant differences between smokers and non-smokers for one-year implant loss and late implant loss (p = 0.053). Thisheterogeneity might be ascribed to the treatment protocols of reducing the frequency of tobacco use for our patients one month before and after surgery. Whether patients had complied with this requirement or not was not available and this should be considered as a supplementary reason for the differences.
Bone augmentation
One study8 found a higher risk for implant loss in patients for whom bone expansion techniques were used during implant placement. Lin et al9 also suggested that implants placed in augmented sites presented an increased higher risk for implant loss when compared with those in non-augmented sites. One rational explanation may be that bone augmentation is frequently involved with complicated surgical procedures for bone grafting, requiring a relatively long surgery time.As a result, these circumstances could raise the chance of biological complications, increased morbidity, and susceptibility to infection. However, other findings declared opposite results,17,18 which is following our findings. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain more reliable evidence through further research.
Tooth position
A study with a large cohort reported implants positioned in the maxilla,19 particularly in the posterior region of the maxilla,20 to be at higher risk for implant loss. On the contrary, another study identified an increased risk for implant loss for implants positioned in the anterior region of the mandible,9,15 which is consistent with our study. This phenomenon might result from a relatively less blood supply due to the abundant cortical bone in this region.
Implant diameter and length
Similarly, implants with a narrow diameter were found to be at a higher risk for implant failure by Alsaadi et al.21 Implant length was not observed to be associated with one-year implant loss and this finding in the present study was in line with data from a report reporting shorter implant as a higher risk for implant loss rather than implant length.9 It should be noted that narrow and short implants are regularly applied at compromised sites, which may lead to a bias in the analyses.
The limitations of our retrospective design may inherently lead to biases. The aetiopathogenesis of dental implant failure is related to multifactorial factors, including local and systemic factors.3 However, diabetes mellitus, one of the systemic factors, was not available in this study. In terms of local factors, periodontal disease or oral hygiene level was also not obtained in this study. To minimise the effect of these possible factors, a standard requirement for patients (including regular visits for any abnormalities, minimising smoking, periodontal treatment, and maintaining oral hygiene) was followed by all the implant surgeons.
Conclusions
We adopted a GEE method to adjust the influence of data of the failed implants from the same patients on the treatment outcome and concluded that implants with immediate placement and early loading were more prone to experience one-year implant loss.

Conducted at Hefei Stomatology Hospital, China, between January 2011 and December 2022, the research initially documented 13,629 implants in 8,707 patients. From this cohort, 279 patients with 287 failed implants were selected based on strict inclusion criteria—patients aged 18 or older with implant failure linked to peri-implant inflammation, excluding those with systemic conditions like uncontrolled diabetes or histories of bisphosphonate therapy.

Demographic, surgical, and implant-specific variables were collected from patient records, including implant location (categorized by jaw and region), timing of implant placement (immediate, early, or delayed), loading protocols (early ≤2 months vs late >2 months), bone augmentation procedures, implant diameter and length, and smoking habits. Statistical analyses involved chi-squared tests for initial identification of potential risk factors, followed by multivariate analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for multiple implants per patient.

The results revealed that 40.8% of implant failures occurred within the first year. Implants placed immediately and loaded early were at significantly higher risk for one-year loss. Multivariate analysis showed that immediate placement increased the risk by over threefold (OR = 3.373) and early loading by over eighteenfold (OR = 18.139) compared with their counterparts. Additional findings indicated that implant location—particularly in the mandibular anterior region—and narrow implant diameters were associated with higher failure rates. These outcomes underscore the importance of optimizing implant placement timing and loading protocols to enhance long-term treatment success.","This retrospective study investigated local factors associated with early (one-year) and late dental implant loss due to peri-implantitis or infection. Researchers analyzed data from 279 patients with 287 failed implants, excluding those with systemic conditions like uncontrolled diabetes or poor oral hygiene. Data collected included demographics, implant location, timing of placement and loading, bone augmentation, smoking habits, and implant dimensions.

Results showed an overall implant failure rate of 2.7%. Univariate analysis identified several potential risk factors for one-year implant loss including location, timing of placement and loading, and diameter. Multivariate analysis revealed that immediate implant placement (same day as extraction) and early loading (≤2 months) were significant risk factors for one-year implant loss. Smoking also showed a trend toward higher risk. The study concludes that immediate implant placement and early loading are associated with increased one-year implant loss. The researchers acknowledge limitations of the retrospective design and data availability but suggest a need for caution with immediate placement and loading protocols.","This research paper investigates the factors associated with one-year and late dental implant loss, focusing on implants lost due to peri-implantitis or infection rather than mechanical complications or poor osseointegration. Dental implants have high survival rates (98.7% at 10 years), but failures still occur, often linked to systemic diseases, poor bone quality, or excessive loading. The study retrospectively analyzed 13,629 implants in 8,707 patients from 2011 to 2022, identifying 287 failed implants in 279 patients. The overall failure rate was 2.7% (implant level) and 4.1% (patient level), with 40.8% of failures occurring within the first year. Key findings include:

Immediate implant placement and early loading (within two months) significantly increased the risk of one-year implant loss, with odds ratios of 3.373 and 18.139, respectively.

Implant location played a role, with higher failure rates in the mandibular anterior (85.2%) and maxillary anterior (62.9%) regions compared to posterior regions.

Narrow-diameter implants had a higher failure rate (56.8%) compared to wider implants.

Smoking showed a trend toward increased failure risk but was not statistically significant (p = 0.053).

Bone augmentation did not significantly affect failure rates.

The study highlights the importance of allowing adequate healing time before implant loading and avoiding immediate placement to reduce early implant loss. Limitations include the retrospective design and lack of data on systemic factors like diabetes. The findings suggest that delayed placement and loading protocols may improve implant survival rates.

In a single unit observation between 2005 and 2021 we retrospectively assessed 1,920 patients who underwent histological analysis for suspected oral lichen planus, and followed the progression of their disease to assess the rate of malignant transformation.

Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic T-cell mediated condition affecting 1.01% of the world population, and 1.43% in Europe.1 It is an inflammatory mucocutaneous disease that can affect the entire oral cavity.
OLP classically presents as six clinical types: reticular, atrophic, papular, bullous, plaque, and erosive. The reticular type is often asymptomatic, and the most common. Erosive OLP is the most aggressive, and is associated with ulcerative and erythematous areas often surrounded by reticular elements.2 Oral lichenoid lesions (OLL) are histopathologically indistinguishable from OLP, but exist in reaction to a foreign body, such as a dental material.3 Typically, OLP affects women in a ratio that ranges from 1.57:1 to 2:1,4 but its prevalence increases significantly with age in both genders.1 A number of studies have demonstrated its potential for malignant transformation (MT).5 The World Health Organization (WHO) describes OLP as a potentially malignant disorder with strict diagnostic criteria (Table 1).
Clinical criteria:
(1) Presence of white papules, reticular, annular, plaque-type lesions, grey-white lines radiating from the papules
(2) Presence of a lace-like network of slightly raised grey-white lines (reticular pattern)
(3) Presence of atrophic lesions with or without erosion, may also be bullous
Histopathological criteria:
(1) Presence of thickened ortho or parakeratinised layer in sites normally keratinised. If site is normally non-keratinised this layer may be very thin
(2) Presence of Civatte bodies in basal layer, epithelium, and superficial part of the connective tissue
(3) Presence of a well-defined band, like a zone of cellular infiltrationthat is confined to the superficial part of the connective tissue, consisting mainly of lymphocytes
(4) Signs of ‘liquefaction degeneration’ in the basal cell layer
Modified WHO diagnostic criteria of OLP and oral lichenoid lesion (OLL) (2003)
Clinical criteria:
(1) Presence of bilateral, more or less symmetrical lesions
(2) Presence of a lace-like network of slightly raised grey-white lines (reticular pattern)
(3) Erosive, atrophic, bullous and plaque-type lesions are accepted only as a subtype in the presence of reticular lesions elsewhere in the oral mucosa. In all other lesions that resemble OLP but do not complete the aforementioned criteria, the term “clinically compatible with” should be used
Histopathological criteria:
(1) Presence of a well-defined band-like zone of cellular infiltrationconfined to the superficial part of the connective tissue, consisting mainly of lymphocytes
(2) Signs of liquefaction degeneration in the basal cell layer
(3) Absence of epithelial dysplasia
**When histopathological features are less obvious, the term “histopathologically compatible with” should be used
**Final diagnosis criteria OLP or OLL
•        
OLP – a diagnosis of OLP requires fulfilment of both clinical and histopathological criteria
•        
OLL – the term OLL will be used under the following conditions:
(1) Clinically typical of OLP but histopathologically compatible only with OLP
(2) Histopathologically typical of OLP but clinically compatible only with OLP
(3) Clinically compatible with OLP and histopathologically compatible with OLP

There is controversy over the malignant transformation rate (MTR), which ranges from 0%–37%.6,7 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) quotes the MTR of OLP to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) as 1.1%.8 Malignant transformation (MT) time ranges from 0–30 years.9 Reported risk factors for MT include: female sex, increased age, time since diagnosis, erosive and plaque subtypes, tongue site, concomitant infection with hepatitis C virus, and Japanese and Mediterranean ethnicities. Additionally, altered expression of p53, BCL-2 and BAX present an increased risk of transformation.10,11
Smoking and alcohol-use do not appear to add to the risk of transformation to SCC.8
In a single unit in the UK over the last 25 years we have observed a higher incidence of MTR from OLP, particularly in the erosive subtype, behaving aggressively in the clinical pathway.
Patients
This study analysed 1,920 patients who underwent clinical and histological analysis for suspected OLP. All those who underwent incisional biopsy for the differential diagnosis of OLP between January 2005 and June 2020 in University Hospitals Dorset were included. Demographics were collected as well as the date of biopsy, and intraoral location.
For those diagnosed with OLP, information from clinic letters, operative notes, and medical photography were examined (the area affected, presence of ulcers, red/white patches, striae or atrophy, and whether treatment was commenced). This determined the OLP subtype. All patients were followed up through clinic letters, histological results, and investigations until June 2021 to determine whether they had subsequently developed oral SCC. The follow-up period ranged from 12 months to 15 years. Patients who were discharged were deemed not to have undergone MT.
Where OLP had undergone MT, information was collected on the staging, age, time to transformation, survival, treatment, smoking status, gender, ethnicity, occupation, medical history, presence of recurrence, and number of primaries.
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 21 (IBM Corp). For the binary logistic regression model, we assessed the development of SCC from OLP using predictors such as age, gender, OLP subtype, lesion location, smoking status, and alcohol intake. McFadden’s Pseudo R-squared was calculated to evaluate the model’s fit.
Survival analysis was conducted to estimate the time to malignant transformation. We employed Kaplan-Meier estimators for survival probabilities and used Cox proportional hazards models to determine the influence of the same variables on the time to transformation, presenting hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals.
Results
The histological results for 1,920 patients undergoing a biopsy for OLP were analysed. Of them, 1,363 patients (71.0%) had a histological diagnosis consistent with OLP (Table 2).

In our analysis using binary logistic regression, none of the predictors showed a statistically significant relation with the development of SCC from OLP. Age, gender, OLP subtype, location within the oral cavity, smoking status, and alcohol intake were included as predictors. The model's Pseudo R-squared value of 0.02524 indicates a low explanatory power. Despite observing trends such as a slight increase in SCC risk with erosive OLP and alcohol intake, these were not statistically significant. This suggests that additional factors or a larger dataset may be needed to discern the complexities of SCC development in OLP patients.
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed the median time to malignant transformation was 5.2 years (95% CI: 3.26 to 7.14 years). Cox proportional hazards models indicated that none of the examined predictors, including age, gender, OLP subtype, lesion location, smoking status, and alcohol intake, significantly influenced the time to malignant transformation (all p values > 0.05).
Of the patients with MT, 64% were female (ratio 1.7). The mean age at diagnosis of OLP was 58.7 years (95% CI: 58 to 59.4 years, range 13-96 years) (Fig. 1). Reticular OLP was the most common form diagnosed (64.8%), followed by erosive OLP at 12.9% (Table 3, Fig. 2).

The most commonly affected site was the buccal mucosa (77.5%) followed by the tongue (31.1%) and alveolar ridge (19.2%).
There were 19 patients and 23 cases of MT from OLP to SCC, a transformation rate of 1.39%. The average time for MT from the date of OLP diagnosis was 5.9 years (95% CI: 4.42 to 7.48 years). Fifty-three per cent were female and the mean (range) age of patients with MT was 66.7 (51-90) years (Table 3, Supplemental Fig. 3). Seventeen of 19 SCC patients (89.5%) were non-smokers. There was no significant history of alcohol intake and no comorbidities were identified.
All cases of SCC occurred at previous sites of active OLP. The tongue, rather than the buccal mucosa, was the site most commonly implicated in primary cancer sites (47.8%) (Supplemental Figs. 4 and 5). The alveolus was the site most commonly associated with advanced disease (rate of T4 tumours 50%) at diagnosis. The floor of the mouth carried the worst prognosis.
Of the 19 cases that underwent MT into oral SCC, 11 were erosive OLP in origin (58%), seven were reticular (37%) and one atrophic (5%). This is despite erosive OLP making up only 13.5% of the OLP population (Table 3). Erosive OLP carried a transformation rate into oral SCC of 5.98% (Table 4. Fig. 2). The mean MT time of OLP into SCC was 5.2 years (95% CI: 3.26 to 7.14 years) (Table 5).

There was a 26% mortality rate in the SCC group with an average survival of 3.4 years.
Five-year survival in patients with SCC arising from OLP was 50% (67%, for T1/T2 tumours). Four patients (21%) with erosive OLP had multiple intraoral malignancies from an affected lesion. One patient with erosive OLP had three separate primaries and two incidents of recurrence. The overall recurrence rate amongst the OLP SCC patients was 21%.
There were six T1 tumours (32%), eight T2 tumours (42%), one T3 (5%), and four T4 tumours (21%), and four (21%) (TMN8) cases with nodal involvement. No patient had disease at a distant site.
All cases were discussed by the local head and neck cancer MDT for staging and treatment planning. Eighteen of 19 patients were treated surgically with a curative intent. One patient with locally advanced disease was managed with palliative radiotherapy.
Discussion
Our data demonstrate a 1.34% MT rate across all types of OLP. This is higher than the MTR of 1.1% quoted by NICE, which is based on a Turkish meta-analysis.1 This discrepancy is likely to be attributable to the elevated prevalence of OLP within the UK compared with global rates.12 Three recent meta-analyses are noteworthy: Idrees et al used stringent criteria for OLP and found a transformation rate of 0.44%,13 González-Moles et al used only high-calibre methodological studies and identified a transformation rate of 2.28%,14 and a systematic review of 24,000 patients yielded a transformation rate of 0.94% and highlighted the fact that red-type OLP (atrophic/erosive/bullous) carries a markedly elevated risk of transformation.15 Furthermore a cohort study of 3000 patients found a MTR of 2.58%.16 Given the range of 0.44% to 2.58%, 1.34% seems consistent.9,14
Our mean MT time of 5.2 years is consistent with comparable studies of between 2.6 to 8.6 years.17 Tsushima et al highlighted that the mean duration of MT was much shorter in red-type OLP than in white-type OLP.18 Our patients who developed SCC were either teetotal or mild alcohol consumers, a significant finding in the SCC pathway.
With regard to erosive OLP, Giuliani et al found that patients with atrophic/erosive OLP had an increased risk of MT compared with those with the reticular subtype (RR = 4.09, 95% CI: 2.40 to 6.98).19 A New Zealand retrospective study found a 25-fold heightened risk of transformation for erosive and atrophic OLP.20 Furthermore, Laniosz et al reported that the erosive type accounted for 71.4% of OSCC from OLP.21 Our finding of a 5.98% MTR of erosive OLP is unprecedented in data collections of this scale.
SCC originating from OLP seems to exhibit poorer outcomes: five-year overall survival (OS) of 50% compares to published survival rates of 66.1% for oral SCC.22 Even in early disease (I & II), this population fares worse (67% vs 79.9%). Interestingly, recurrence rates were lower at (21% vs 32%).22 Despite this, the incidence of multiple primaries, particularly in the erosive group, presents a unique challenge for post-treatment surveillance.
We would have liked to follow the patients up for longer. It is likely that further patients will go on to develop SCC so the true transformation rate could be higher still. A further limitation of this study is that we did not collect data on previous OLP treatment received by our patients.
The mainstay of treatment is immunosuppressants such as glucocorticoid steroid mouthwashes and tablets. More symptomatic patients may require greater treatment, and the use of the immunosuppressive treatment could have a causative impact on the MTR. However, a recent study by Bindakhil et al found topical corticosteroid treatments to be protective by delaying transformation to malignancy by up to four years.23
Although our study is retrospective, the surviving SCC patients are still being followed up. The patient cohort has no predisposing factors. All patients were treated with topical or parenteral steroids. The patients who developed SCC did not have comorbidities and the incidence of nearly 6% in the erosive group is worrying. The development of synchronous and multiple SCCs within the oral cavity requires investigation and further study. The aggressive behaviour of the oral SCC group is a major concern. This behaviour, we believe, needs a prospective national study and, most importantly, these patients need to undergo continuous close surveillance indefinitely.

OLP manifests in several clinical forms—reticular, atrophic, papular, bullous, plaque, and the more aggressive erosive type, which is notably associated with ulcerative and erythematous lesions. Using the stringent World Health Organization (WHO) clinical and histopathological criteria for diagnosis, the research differentiates OLP from oral lichenoid lesions (OLL) that occur due to foreign body reactions.

The retrospective study analyzed 1,920 patients from University Hospitals Dorset who underwent incisional biopsies for suspected OLP between January 2005 and June 2020. Of these, 1,363 (71%) were confirmed as OLP cases. Patient data—including demographics, lesion characteristics, and follow-up information—were collected to assess the rate and timing of malignant transformation (MT) into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Over a follow-up period ranging from 12 months to 15 years, 19 patients (1.39% of OLP cases) developed SCC, with the erosive subtype showing a particularly high transformation rate of 5.98%. The median time to MT was approximately 5.2 years. Notably, factors such as age, gender, lesion location, smoking, and alcohol intake did not statistically predict SCC development.

The study highlights that SCC arising from OLP, especially from the erosive subtype, tends to have poorer outcomes with a 50% five-year survival rate. These findings underscore the necessity for rigorous, long-term surveillance and further prospective research to better understand and manage the malignant potential of OLP.","This study investigates the malignant transformation rate (MTR) of oral lichen planus (OLP) to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using data from 1,920 patients who underwent biopsy for suspected OLP between 2005 and 2020. A histological diagnosis of OLP was consistent in 71.0% of patients. Results showed an overall MTR of 1.39%, with a median time to transformation of 5.2 years. While traditional risk factors like age, gender, smoking, and alcohol didn't significantly predict SCC development, the erosive OLP subtype exhibited a notably higher transformation rate of 5.98%. Furthermore, SCC originating from OLP demonstrated poorer survival outcomes compared to general oral SCC, despite lower recurrence rates. The authors highlight the aggressive behavior of SCC arising from OLP, particularly in the erosive subtype, and the challenge of managing multiple primary cancers. They recommend a prospective national study, and indefinite continuous surveillance for these patients.","This research paper investigates the malignant transformation (MT) rate of oral lichen planus (OLP), a chronic inflammatory condition affecting 1.01% of the global population, into oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). OLP has six clinical subtypes, with erosive OLP being the most aggressive. The study analyzed 1,920 patients who underwent biopsies for suspected OLP between 2005 and 2020, identifying 1,363 cases (71%) consistent with OLP. Of these, 19 patients (1.39%) developed SCC, with a mean transformation time of 5.2 years. Erosive OLP had the highest MT rate (5.98%), despite representing only 13.5% of OLP cases. Most SCC cases occurred in non-smokers and mild alcohol consumers, with the tongue being the most common site for malignancy. The five-year survival rate for SCC arising from OLP was 50%, lower than the general oral SCC survival rate of 66.1%. Key findings include:

Erosive OLP carries a significantly higher risk of MT compared to other subtypes.

Non-smokers and mild alcohol consumers were more likely to develop SCC.

The tongue was the most common site for SCC, with advanced disease often found in the alveolus.

Patients with erosive OLP had a higher incidence of multiple primary cancers and recurrence.

The study highlights the aggressive nature of SCC arising from OLP, particularly in erosive subtypes, and underscores the need for long-term surveillance in OLP patients. Limitations include the retrospective design and lack of data on prior OLP treatments. The findings suggest that erosive OLP patients require closer monitoring due to their elevated risk of malignant transformation. The study calls for further prospective research to better understand the factors driving MT and improve patient outcomes.",5,2.8,15.48,,,90,95,10,100,88,88,15,100,85,90,10,100

Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is an effective way of relieving severe upper airway obstruction.","Introduction
Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) is characterised by micrognathia, glossoptosis, and upper airway obstruction (UAO) often in combination with a U-shaped cleft palate.1 The incidence ranges between 1 in 8 000 births2 to 1 in 30 000 births.3
Upper airway obstruction may impair breathing, feeding, and, consequently, growth. Most PRS-patients can be treated conservatively with nonsurgical measures, for example a nasopharyngeal airway or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).4,5 Alternative treatment options are mandibular traction devices6 or tongue-lip adhesion,7 with the aim of keeping the airway sufficiently open.8,9 In advanced cases, the airway obstruction can be life-threatening. Tracheostomy is an effective procedure to address this problem.10 On average, the age at decannulation is 3.1 years, subjecting PRS-patients to a long time of potential problems.3 Because of the high morbidity, mortality and costs associated with this invasive measure, other alternatives have been investigated.11–13
Since the introduction of mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) in 1995, this treatment has proven to be very effective, achieving 97.6% decannulation in PRS-patients.14 Mandibular distraction devices require an osteotomy but allow distraction of the mandible while protecting the temporomandibular joint. The upper airway size at the retropalatal level will increase, leading to physiological improvements in the apnoea-hypopnea index and minimum oxygen saturation.15
Short- and mid-term effects of MDO on jaw growth have been described in various articles.16–19 Shape anomalies of the permanent molars, root changes, and positional changes due to the surgery have also been documented.20
The aim of this study is to compare the long-term effects (>5 years) on the growth pattern of the mandible of PRS-patients treated with an external mandibular distraction device with no-surgery cases and to investigate the dental development or damage.
Material and methods
This study was approved by the ethical board of the University Hospital of Antwerp (B3002020000155). Informed consent was obtained from all representatives of the included patients.
Patient population
Inclusion criteria were patients with isolated PRS. A retrospective cohort study was performed and all included patients had follow up of at least five years and were born between 1996 and 2014. The patients were treated by the same maxillofacial surgeon.
PRS-patients with follow up of less than five years or PRS-patients who also had a combination of neuromuscular diseases or syndromic patients were excluded.
Surgery was preferred if patients had clinical obstruction symptoms as a consequence of PRS that could not be managed with conservative measures. Before MDO, all children with an indication for surgery had a polysomnography (PSG), microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (MLB), which showed moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).21
All patients had a cleft palate, which was surgically corrected at the age of nine months (soft palate) and 18 months (hard palate) according to the cleft treatment protocol of our institution.22
The patient records were screened retrospectively and reviewed to evaluate long-term outcomes. All included patients were recalled for a physical examination. An orthopantomogram and lateral cephalogram (Planmeca ProMax 2DS2, 68kV, 10mA; Planmeca) were made for evaluation of dental development and skeletal analysis.
Treatment plan and surgical technique
Patients in whom conservative measures would not suffice and a tracheostomy was considered, underwent MDO with a Molina unidirectional external mandibular distractor (KLS Martin Group) as their primary surgical therapy. All patients received an endoscopy by the ENT surgeon prior to MDO to exclude any other cause of airway obstruction.
No preoperative 3D planning was performed, with the ‘as low as reasonably achievable’ (ALARA) principle in mind. Placing guides would mean more degloving of the mandible and therefore more swelling.
After an intraoral posterior vestibular incision, subperiosteal dissection was performed. Bilaterally, a minimal invasive oblique corticotomy was made from the retromolar region towards the mandibular angle, using a small reciprocating saw or a piezotome. The corticotomy was performed as far as possible in the lingual side while protecting the overlying soft tissue. The percutaneous distraction pins were placed posteriorly and anteriorly to the corticotomy, a few millimetres above the mandibular border, while extra skin was pinched between the pins to avoid traction force on the skin during the distraction phase (Fig. 1). The division between the proximal and distal segments was achieved by digital pressure on the distal segment. Subsequently external distractors were placed over the pins and the activation test was performed.

Fig. 1 The percutaneous distraction pins were placed posteriorly and anteriorly to the corticotomy, a few millimetres above the mandibular border, while extra skin was pinched between the pins. This was to avoid traction force on the skin during the distraction phase.
Perioperatively, the overjet was measured between the upper and lower alveolar ridge to calculate the amount of distraction needed.
The distraction device was activated immediately, at a rate of 2 × 1 mm each day. The distraction was continued until a neutral-relation was achieved between the upper and lower jaw. No overcorrection was done, according to the surgeon's preference. The distraction pins were removed during the check-up consultation after a consolidation phase of minimum four weeks.
Clinical course
Extubation was possible after 4-5 days (8-10 mm distraction), after careful clinical evaluation by cardiorespiratory monitoring and approval of the intensive care specialist.
Postoperatively, feeding started directly by a nasogastric tube and oral feeding was started within two weeks after the surgery. A Habermann feeder was used in presence of a cleft palate.
Data collection
Primary outcomes consisted of mandibular growth measured by cephalometric landmarks (Fig. 2). Dental development and damage related to the surgery in the premolar-molar region of the mandible, clinically presenting as agenesis, crown shape changes, root malformations or positional changes were investigated. Percentages were calculated on ten teeth per case. An analysis between the two treatment groups was made as well as a comparison to normal values of a healthy population.

Anatomical lines automatically drawn by the software (Onyx) based on the landmark placement.
A digital cephalometry in OnyxCeph (Image Instruments) was performed based on the Bjork-Jarabak skeletal analysis and landmarks used in the study published by Paes et al.17 The articular angle (S-Ar-Go), sellar angle (N-S-Ar) and gonial angle (Ar-Go-Me) are used in the analysis of facial growth patterns. The sum of the articular angle, sellar angle, and gonial angle is called the Bjork sum angle and will be larger and smaller than 396° in an open (clockwise) and closed (counter clockwise) growth pattern, respectively.23–25
The age- and gender-specific cephalometric data of the University of Bonn were used as reference values for the normal population.26
Statistical analysis
The data were collected and statistical analysis was performed with JMP software (SAS Institute Inc).
Significant differences in dental status between the two groups were evaluated using the Fisher's exact test for small samples.
The cephalometric analysis is presented for the total population as well as for the two treatment groups. The measurement data was tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical differences were analysed using a two-tailed independent samples t test for normal distributed data and using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for non-normal distributed data.
To compare the cephalometric measurements with normal values, a one-sample t test assuming a mean value of zero for the z-scores was performed in order to find statistically significant differences between the two groups and the normal population.
Results
A total of 43 PRS-patients presented to our department between 1996 and 2014. Ten patients were lost to follow up or had insufficient data to be included. Eleven patients were excluded because of certain syndromes or neuromuscular diseases. Three patients with a follow up of less than five years were also excluded.
A total of 19 patients was included of whom nine underwent MDO (Surgery group, n = 9) and 10 patients (No-surgery group, n = 10) had a conservative follow up. The median age at surgery for the Surgery group was nine weeks. The average was 21 weeks due to an outlier. The demographics are shown in Table 1.

In the Surgery group, four patients (44%) had agenesia in the lower jaw. In the No-surgery group, there were six patients (60%). The second premolars were the most often agenetic: three patients in the Surgery group and five patients in the No-surgery group, respectively.
Regarding shape changes of the crown, there were only two patients in the Surgery group. Shape changes included hypoplasia and in one tooth the presence of a hole at the enamel/dentin junction (Fig. 3).

The SNA-angle, which represents maxillary growth, was not significantly smaller in the Surgery group compared to the No-surgery group. But compared with normal values, the SNA-angle for the surgery group was significantly smaller (p = 0.0385).
There were no significant differences in the intergroup comparison in any of the measurements besides the articular angle and the sellar angle. The articular and sellar angle was significantly larger and smaller in the Surgery group, respectively. The gonial angle showed no significant difference. The Bjork sum angle was 400.7° and 396.7° for the Surgery and No-surgery group, respectively, and showed no significant difference. An example of a comparison of the growth pattern in both groups can be seen in supplementary Figure 4 (online only). Other indicators for a more vertical clockwise growth pattern did not differ significantly.
The total mandibular length (Ar-Pg) and the vertical component ramus height (Ar-Go) in the Surgery group were significantly smaller compared to normal values. The horizontal component Go-Pg and Go-Me is significantly shorter for all PRS-patients, regardless of their treatment. There was no significant difference in the intergroup comparison.
The anterior facial height was not significantly larger in the Surgery group versus the No surgery group. The posterior facial height was comparable for both groups. Compared with the normal population, there was no significant difference found in both anterior and posterior facial height in the Surgery and No-surgery group.
The long-term clinical outcome at age 15 of one of the patients in the surgery group is shown in supplementary Figure 5 (online only). No further mandibular advancement techniques were necessary.
Discussion
The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term effects (>5 years) on the growth pattern of the mandible in infants treated with MDO and to investigate the dental development or damage related to its technique.
Regarding jaw growth, there was no significant difference. One can question whether the patients who had MDO might have had a more retrusive jaw at birth. If this is the case, one can interpret that MDO results in a ‘growth boost’ so the final jaw length is comparable to the No-surgery group.
Regarding maxillary growth, the SNA value is only significantly smaller in the Surgery group compared to normal values. This restricted maxillary growth can be explained by the presence of a cleft palate and the effect of surgical intervention.
Many articles suggest a more pronounced vertical growth pattern associated with PRS.17,27 However, this could not be proven in our study, as some parameters indicated that more vertical growth was not significantly larger. The limited data can be the causative factor.
Dental trauma has often been described in literature as a consequence of the osteotomy or pin placement. The use of external distractors is considered to be a risk factor for injuring dental buds because of the bicortical pin placement.28 Alternative osteotomy-designs (inverted L-shape) and using internal distractors have been proposed to avoid injuring tooth buds during the osteotomy.16
No significant differences were found in dental injury or shape/root malformations, but they concerned only those patients who had had MDO. The absence of significance is presumably due to the small sample size. The second premolars were most often missing, which are also the most common congenitally missing teeth. Futhermore, the smaller mandible in PRS-patients has the potential to affect tooth development, since there is an association between mandibular morphology and dental agenesis.29
Damage to teeth may be induced by bicortical pin placement. This is a major drawback for the use of external distractors. However, this kind of damage was only seen in two patients. The osteotomy design is of importance in preventing tooth damage. In this study, the surgeon performed an oblique corticotomy at the angle of the mandible.
One study reporting long-term outcomes after internal resorbable devices showed 70 percent positional/directional changes in molars and another 70% of cases with shape anomalies.17 A study of 34 patients with a mean age of 8.1 years during MDO showed that almost half of the patients did not have any tooth alterations after MDO, and more than 20% presented only bud distalisation.20 However, this patient population is not comparable with the patients treated with distraction devices in this study, since the median age during surgery is nine weeks in our population. The stage of dental development is therefore very different. Another retrospective study including 141 patients over a time frame of 16 years reported only 0.67% damage to tooth follicles or teeth.30 It is obvious that there is a broad variation in reports of dental damage due to the differences in surgical techniques, devices, age at which the procedure is done, and the definition of tooth damage.
This study has potential limitations, including the small size of patient groups and the retrospective nature of this study. In future, having a multicentric prospective study with a large patient population, might give more insight on this interesting topic.
Conclusion
There is paucity in literature regarding the long-term effects of MDO on the mandibular growth and dental damage in PRS-patients. Negative effects on growth of the mandible or a more vertical growth pattern could not be seen in this study. However, the intrinsic growth potential of PRS-patients seems to be normal, which does not exclude subsequent procedures for correction of the jaw relation at an older age. Dental damage is rare if the osteotomy and pins are placed strategically and should not be used as a drawback. MDO is a valuable, safe treatment for PRS-patients where a tracheostomy or long-term CPAP treatment is considered.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission
This study was approved by the ethical board of the University Hospital of Antwerp (B3002020000155). Informed consent was obtained from all representatives of the included patients.","This research study examines the long-term (>5 years) effects of mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) on jaw growth and dental development in infants with Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS), a condition characterized by micrognathia, glossoptosis, and upper airway obstruction often with a U-shaped cleft palate. While most PRS patients are managed conservatively with airway support techniques such as CPAP, severe cases may require surgical intervention. MDO has demonstrated high decannulation success rates, offering an alternative to tracheostomy.

The study analyzed 19 isolated PRS patients, born between 1996 and 2014, with a minimum five-year follow-up. Patients were divided into two groups: nine underwent MDO using an external mandibular distractor, and ten received conservative management. All patients underwent standardized cleft palate repair and cephalometric and dental evaluations using orthopantomograms and lateral cephalograms, with comparisons made against normal reference values.

Results indicated that while the surgery group had a significantly smaller SNA angle compared to normal, other cephalometric parameters showed no significant differences between the surgical and conservative groups. Notably, mandibular length and ramus height were reduced in the surgical group compared to normative data, yet the overall mandibular growth pattern was maintained. Dental analysis revealed minimal complications, including limited instances of agenesis and shape anomalies, with no significant differences between groups.

In conclusion, MDO appears to be a safe and effective treatment for PRS patients requiring airway intervention, with minimal long-term adverse effects on mandibular growth, thereby supporting its use as an alternative to more invasive procedures. These findings support MDO's long-term clinical efficacy.","This study investigates the long-term effects of mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) on mandibular growth and dental development in Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) patients, comparing outcomes to conservatively managed cases. Nineteen patients with isolated PRS were included, nine underwent MDO and ten were managed conservatively. Cephalometric and dental analyses were performed, and compared to normative data.

The study found no significant difference in mandibular growth between the MDO and no-surgery groups, suggesting MDO may provide a ""growth boost"" in the surgery group. The MDO group had a smaller SNA angle, indicating restricted maxillary growth, likely due to cleft palate repair. Dental damage was rare and not significantly different between groups, however dental malformations occurred only in the surgery group. The authors conclude MDO appears to be a valuable treatment option for PRS patients with severe airway obstruction, without demonstrably harming jaw growth in the long term, and strategic osteotomy and pin placement can minimize dental damage. The study acknowledges limitations due to small sample size and its retrospective design.","This research paper evaluates the long-term effects of mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) on mandibular growth and dental development in patients with Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS), a condition characterized by micrognathia, glossoptosis, and upper airway obstruction. PRS often requires surgical intervention, such as MDO, to alleviate airway obstruction and avoid tracheostomy. The study retrospectively analyzed 19 PRS patients (9 treated with MDO and 10 managed conservatively) with a follow-up of at least five years. Cephalometric analysis and dental assessments were conducted to compare mandibular growth patterns and dental damage between the two groups.

Key findings include:

Mandibular Growth: No significant differences in mandibular growth were observed between the MDO and non-surgery groups. However, the MDO group showed significantly smaller maxillary growth (SNA angle) compared to normal values, likely due to cleft palate surgery.

Dental Development: Dental damage, such as agenesis, crown shape changes, and root malformations, was rare in both groups. The second premolars were the most commonly missing teeth, but no significant differences in dental anomalies were found between the groups.

Vertical Growth Pattern: Contrary to previous studies, no significant vertical growth pattern was observed in PRS patients, regardless of treatment.

Safety of MDO: MDO was found to be a safe and effective treatment for PRS, with minimal dental damage when the osteotomy and pin placement were strategically performed.

The study concludes that MDO does not negatively impact long-term mandibular growth or dental development in PRS patients. While PRS patients may require additional jaw correction procedures later in life, MDO is a valuable alternative to tracheostomy or long-term CPAP treatment. The small sample size and retrospective design are limitations, highlighting the need for larger, prospective studies to further validate these findings.",29,3.2,14.9,,,90,95,10,100,80,85,20,100,88,90,10,100

This retrospective study evaluates the range of e-scooter-related maxillofacial trauma before the recent scheme extension and compares the findings with existing literature on this topic. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, United Kingdom (UK) operates as a Level 1 Regional Major Trauma Centre and serves a population of four million. All patient records between September 2021 to September 2022 were analysed to establish the types of e-scooter-related maxillofacial trauma sustained. A Pearson?s chi-squared test was used to assess for significant associations between variables recorded. Falls accounted for the majority of injuries (44.3%), and soft tissue lacerations were the most common maxillofacial injury (38%). Statistically significant results were measured in the following variables: gender and intoxication status (p¬†=¬†0.007), helmet status and injuries sustained in maxillofacial and non-maxillofacial regions (p¬†=¬†0.043), mechanism of injury and injuries sustained in both the maxillofacial and non-maxillofacial regions (p¬†=¬†0.045). E-scooters are an emerging concern within the UK. Further studies across the UK are required to assess the frequency of e-scooter-related injuries. Such data may prove useful in determining the government's decision on e-scooter use on UK roads.","Introduction
The rapid emergence and widespread adoption of micromobility solutions, particularly e-scooters, offers a means of efficient and affordable travel in urban areas. Since 2017, major urban centres worldwide, such as Singapore, New Zealand, and Austria have implemented such transportation modes.1–3 The ride-sharing e-scooter industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, with the European Market Capitalisation estimated to reach €83.94 billion by 2029, representing a compound annual growth rate of 24.2%.4
In June 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) issued guidance for the regulated introduction of e-scooters. This legal framework empowered local councils to establish contracts with independent ride-sharing companies.5 The policy aimed to assess the influence of e-scooter usage in reducing motor traffic and pollution, in line with the objective of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.6 Since then, e-scooter schemes have proliferated across various UK councils, with 32 implementing the programme as of December 2021.7 Birmingham, the UK's third most populous city with approximately 2.6 million residents,8 entered into a contract with ‘Voi' (Voi Company), an e-scooter start-up launched in 2018. Voi assumed responsibility for providing e-scooter rentals and the associated technology to ensure the efficient introduction and maintenance of e-scooters in Birmingham. Currently, Voi has expanded its operations and serves as the exclusive e-scooter contractor in over 100 European towns and cities.9
Initially set for a one-year pilot period in September 2020, the e-scooter scheme in Birmingham has since undergone several extension periods, with the most recent extending from September 2022 to May 2024.10 As of February 2023, Birmingham Council currently operates approximately 2,000 e-scooters within the geographical region, facilitating around 30,000 rides per week. It is estimated that a quarter of these e-scooter journeys have replaced car trips that would have otherwise been taken.11
With the global adoption of this new mode of transportation, concerns have emerged regarding the safety risks, specifically regarding injuries to riders and pedestrians. Maxillofacial injuries, including facial fractures, soft tissue trauma, dental injuries, and head and neck trauma, are of particular concern. These injuries have profound physical, psychological, and socioeconomic implications for individuals and healthcare systems. E-scooter-related injuries to the face, head, and neck have been reported in 46%–58% of patients,12,13 placing a substantial burden on Emergency Departments and healthcare professionals responsible for managing such injuries. While the literature on e-scooter-related maxillofacial injuries during the pilot period is well-documented, 14,15 data beyond this period are limited. The aim of this study was to review the demographic characteristics, injury patterns, and subsequent management of maxillofacial injuries sustained in Birmingham following the conclusion of the initial pilot period in September 2021.
Methods
The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB) operates as a Level 1 Regional Major Trauma Centre within the United Kingdom, catering to a population of four million individuals. QEHB, in conjunction with peripheral hospitals in Birmingham constitutes the University Hospitals Birmingham Trust (UHB). Within this geographic region, the QEHB OMFS Department receives tertiary referrals within the trust area to address maxillofacial conditions among adult patients. The trust area also coincides with the geographic region where the e-scooter scheme has been conducted.
This retrospective study received approval from the Clinical Audit and Research Management System (CARMS). A Health Informatics Request was used to retrieve patient records containing the keywords “scooter”, “e-scooter” and “electric”. The request covered a one-year period from September 2021 to September 2022. The resulting database underwent screening by a single reviewer (the lead author) to identify relevant entries of patients who sustained maxillofacial injuries related to e-scooters. The complete clinical records of eligible patients were then analysed using the “Prescribed Information and Clinical Systems” (PICS) software, which is unique to UHB and used by clinicians at QEHB for electronic patient data management.
The retrospective recording of data included patient characteristics such as age, gender, mechanism of injury, helmet status, intoxication status, head injury status, OMFS injuries sustained, additional non-OMFS injuries sustained, and the management undertaken. The inclusion criteria encompassed adult patients (≥16 years of age) who experienced maxillofacial injuries associated with e-scooters, whether as riders or pedestrians. The data was subsequently extracted and put into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Version 24, IBM Corp.) software. To assess significant risk factor associations among the recorded variables (excluding age and management undertaken), a Pearson's chi-squared test (χ2) was utilised. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Patient demographics
During this one-year period, a total of 79 patients (n = 79) sustained maxillofacial injuries that were related to e-scooters. The mean (range) age was 31.7 (17–92) years. The mean (range) age for males was 31.7 (17–92) years compared to 31 (18–47) years for females. Males formed a larger proportion of the total patients (83.5%, n = 66). A total of 82% (n = 65) of patients were between the ages of 17–39.
Mechanism of injury
The most common mechanism of injury was unprovoked falls off e-scooters by riders, which was recorded as 44.3% (n = 35). The second most common was e-scooter vs motor vehicles, which accounted for 20.3% (n = 16) of patients. Females accounted for a slightly larger proportion of patients who suffered an injury due to a fall (6/13) compared to males (29/66).
There were two male patients who suffered an alleged assault whilst they were riding their e-scooters. The uneven road surface category, also known as ‘potholes’, was the cause of injury in 10.1% (n = 9) of patients. All pedestrian patients (n = 6) presented with soft tissue injuries and only one of these patients suffered a hard tissue injury, which was a fracture to the humerus.
Helmet status
There was documentation of the helmet status for 23 patients. Out of these 23 patients, only five had worn a helmet at the time of injury. Two of these patients were female and the remaining three were male. Fifteen patients who did not wear a helmet were male. In addition, 12 patients, who did not wear a helmet, also sustained a hard tissue injury of the OMFS region.
Intoxication status
No documentation was present for intoxication status for 55 patients. Out of the remaining 24 patients, 23 were documented as being intoxicated, with the most common substance being alcohol (21/23). The remaining two patients documented as intoxicated were due to cocaine (n = 1) and cannabis (n = 1) use. Only 2/23 patients who were confirmed to be intoxicated were female. Moreover, 15/23 patients confirmed intoxicated sustained a OMFS hard tissue injury.
Head injury status
A total of 33/79 patients suffered a head injury in association with a maxillofacial injury. Seven were confirmed with a CT scan, subsequently requiring admission for neurological observations for a period of 24–48 hours. The remaining 26 patients were diagnosed with concussion and were given both verbal and written head injury advice as a form of management. A total of 6/7 patients with a confirmed head injury from a CT scan also sustained a hard tissue injury in the OMFS region, this was higher when compared to 5/25 concussion patients who also sustained an OMFS hard tissue injury.The complete breakdown of factors recorded which influenced traumatic injury profile is summarised in Table 1.

Maxillofacial injuries
Fig. 1 displays the maxillofacial injuries sustained and subsequent management for the 79 patients. The most common hard tissue injury was dental (n = 24). The most common fracture site of the OMFS region was the orbit (n = 5). Facial fractures at QEHB had a higher tendency to be managed conservatively, which was the case for 16/19 patients. Soft tissue injuries to the OMFS Region were the most prevalent form of OMFS injury (n = 129), with the most common soft tissue injury type being lacerations, which were documented on 68 occasions, followed by abrasions at 39, and finally contusions (n = 18). The remaining soft tissue injury types documented were unspecified.

Fig. 1 Distribution and management of maxillofacial injuries.
The most common soft tissue injury site was documented as peri-orbital (n = 25). Operative management of soft tissue injuries entailed wound care (defined as debridement and dressings) in 15/39 patients, with the remaining injuries managed by primary closure via suturing or glue. A total of 51 patients who sustained an injury to the maxillofacial region also exhibited an injury in a non-maxillofacial region. The location of hard and soft tissue injury is illustrated in Fig. 2.

Statistical analysis
A χ2 test of independence revealed significant associations between several variables recorded. This included:
•        
Gender and intoxication status (p = 0.007).
•        
Helmet Status and injuries sustained in both the maxillofacial and non-maxillofacial regions (p = 0.043).
•        
Mechanism of injury and injuries sustained in both the maxillofacial and non-maxillofacial regions (p = 0.045).
Head Injury status was the only variable recorded which did not form a significant association with any of the other variables. The complete statistical analysis results are outlined in Table 2.

Discussion
There were an additional 69 non-OMFS injuries documented of which 22 were to the lower body. The most common lower body injury type was knee abrasions (n = 12) whereas in the upper body it was hand abrasions (n = 10). Of the 25 hard tissue injuries to the upper body, the most common was the distal radius (n = 4). These were likely due to ‘fall on an outstretched hand’ injuries where patients were attempting to break their falls. Only three patients had suffered fractures to the lower body which were to the tibia, fibula, and the greater toe proximal phalanx.
Falls from e-scooters were the predominant cause of injury in our cohort, with a study in the United States also reporting this in 80% of patients with e-scooter related facial injuries.16 Our findings also align with the current published literature, with over 50% of soft tissue injuries being lacerations.17,18 We had recorded the peri-orbital regions (including eyebrows), forehead and lips as the most commonly affected sites for soft tissue injuries. Studies have suggested those who comply with e-scooter helmet use tend to wear open face or half coverage helmets, which increases the risk of peri-orbital injuries.19,20
When considering facial fracture location, 12/19 occurred in the midface region. A total of 9% of patients experienced intracranial haemorrhages, with one-third of these cases involving alcohol intoxication. A study in Berlin concluded traumatic brain injury may possibly be linked to alcohol consumption in e-scooter related incidents.21 According to current UK regulations, e-scooters are classified as motor vehicles and therefore must be operated on roads. Consequently, e-scooters ride in close proximity to other vehicles, increasing the risk of collisions. The UK has witnessed a rise in such collisions, resulting in 1003 new cases and 12 fatalities in the year ending June 2022.22
In terms of road conditions, a substantial number of potholes exist on UK roads, which contributed to 10.1% of injuries in patients from the current study. A pothole is defined as a depression in the road surface, usually caused by bad weather or repeated contact of motor vehicles with road surfaces. Maintaining good road conditions is crucial to enhance rider safety and instil a greater sense of security.
Compliance with helmet use for e-scooters remains a concern globally, with reported rates ranging from 0 to 2%.23,24 While current UK legislation recommends helmet use, it is not compulsory. Wearing helmets has shown to decrease the incidence of facial trauma in motorcyclists, and similar benefits would be expected for e-scooter riders.25 A significant link between helmet status and the risk of sustaining injuries to both the OMFS and non-OMFS regions has been identified from this study. Intoxication while operating e-scooters carries penalties equivalent to drink driving within the UK. Shiffler et al opined alcohol causes a decrease in reflex response, preventing a fall from being broken and thus exposing the face as the primary point of contact.26
The most common injuries for unhelmeted patients were Dental (n = 14), eyebrow lacerations (n = 6) and lip lacerations (n = 4). 6 facial fractures were sustained for those unhelmeted compared to zero for patients who had worn a helmet. Those unhelmeted averaged twice the number of OMFS injuries compared to those helmeted (2.5 and 1.2, respectively). A total ofr 3/5 helmeted patients sustained concussions whereas 5/18 unhelmeted patients sustained concussions, with a further one patient suffering an intracranial hemorrhage. Clough et al identified that although cycling incidents occur eight times more than e-scooter incidents, e-scooters display a statistically significant greater frequency in head trauma.27
Operative management was required for 42 injuries (23.7%), presenting reconstructive and remedial challenges that place a burden on the National Health Service. Ahluwalia et al calculated the cost of acute and non-acute surgeries for e-scooter injuries, which is estimated at £1500 and £900, respectively. However, only 16% of patients required immediate admission including 4% who went to the Intensive Therapy Unit, thus escalating costs for a small minority of the cohort and signifying many patients sustained minor injuries in their study.28
The retrospective nature of the study relied on accurate documentation by clinicians. However, recording of intoxication and helmet status was inadequate. Differentiating between government-contracted and private e-scooter use was challenging, often necessitating assumptions based on unclear records. We also assumed all e-scooter injuries had occurred in Birmingham unless it was stated otherwise.
Significant associations were observed between several variables, highlighting their influence on the type, location, and extent of e-scooter-related maxillofacial injuries. Further research across the UK is imperative to explore the relationship between these variables and the occurrence of maxillofacial injuries. Such data will prove crucial in safety considerations and the final decision made by the UK Government regarding e-scooter use in May 2024.
Conclusion
E-scooter related facial injuries are an emerging concern in the UK, with multiple variables influencing the location, type, and severity of these injuries. Further studies assessing the frequency of such injuries following the pilot period extensions across the UK are essential to estimate the potential burden on the National Health Service. This data will play a crucial role in informing the government's decision on e-scooter use on UK roads by May 2024. Interventions aimed at enhancing user and public safety, such as compulsory helmet use, dedicated e-scooter lanes, formal practical e-scooter training, and incorporation of theoretical training in motor vehicle licensing regarding interactions with e-scooters, should be considered. These measures have the potential to improve safety and promote good etiquette among road users.

Conflict of interest
We have no conflicts of interest.","This study examines the impact of e-scooter use on maxillofacial injuries in Birmingham, UK, following the conclusion of the initial pilot period in September 2021. Amid the global rise in micromobility, e-scooters have been promoted as an efficient and eco-friendly transport alternative. In the UK, after regulated guidelines were introduced in June 2020, many local councils—including Birmingham—adopted e-scooter schemes in partnership with ride-sharing companies like Voi. With approximately 2,000 e-scooters operating and around 30,000 weekly rides in Birmingham, it is estimated that about one quarter of these journeys replaced car trips.

The retrospective study, conducted over one year from September 2021 to September 2022, used patient records from Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham—a Level 1 Regional Major Trauma Centre—to identify maxillofacial injuries linked to e-scooter incidents. A total of 79 patients (mean age 31.7 years, 83.5% male) were included. The most common mechanism of injury was unprovoked falls, followed by collisions with motor vehicles and injuries due to uneven road surfaces. Data revealed low helmet usage among documented cases, with only a few patients wearing helmets at the time of injury. Intoxication, predominantly from alcohol, was also frequently recorded.

Injury patterns predominantly involved dental trauma and soft tissue lacerations, with significant associations identified between gender, helmet status, and intoxication on injury severity. The findings underscore the need for safety interventions—such as compulsory helmet use, dedicated e-scooter lanes, and targeted training—to mitigate risks and alleviate the burden on healthcare services, ultimately informing future regulatory decisions on e-scooter operations.","This retrospective study investigates maxillofacial injuries related to e-scooter use in Birmingham, UK, following the initial pilot program (Sept 2021-Sept 2022). The study analysed data from 79 patients treated at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, a major trauma centre. The most common injury mechanism was falls from e-scooters, with males comprising the majority of patients. Dental injuries and soft tissue lacerations were frequent. Statistical analysis revealed significant associations between gender and intoxication status, helmet status and injuries sustained (OMFS & non OMFS), and mechanism of injury and injuries sustained (OMFS & non OMFS). Helmet use was infrequent, and intoxication was a contributing factor in many cases. While the study highlights the rising concern of e-scooter-related injuries and their impact on healthcare resources, it acknowledges limitations like incomplete documentation of intoxication and helmet use. The findings underscore the need for interventions like mandatory helmet use, dedicated e-scooter lanes, and enhanced training to improve e-scooter safety and inform future UK government policy.","This research paper investigates the demographic characteristics, injury patterns, and management of maxillofacial injuries related to e-scooter use in Birmingham, UK, following the initial pilot period of e-scooter schemes. E-scooters have gained popularity as an urban mobility solution, but concerns about safety, particularly facial and head injuries, have emerged. The study retrospectively analyzed 79 patients treated at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham between September 2021 and September 2022 for e-scooter-related maxillofacial injuries.Key findings include:

Demographics: Most patients were male (83.5%), with a mean age of 31.7 years. The majority (82%) were aged 17–39.

Mechanism of Injury: Unprovoked falls (44.3%) and collisions with motor vehicles (20.3%) were the most common causes of injury. Pedestrians accounted for 7.6% of injuries.

Helmet Use: Only 6% of patients wore helmets, with unhelmeted riders sustaining more severe injuries, including facial fractures and head trauma.

Intoxication: Alcohol intoxication was documented in 26.6% of cases, with intoxicated patients more likely to sustain hard tissue injuries.

Injury Patterns: Soft tissue injuries, particularly lacerations (68 cases), were the most common, with the peri-orbital region being the most affected. Dental injuries (24 cases) and orbital fractures (5 cases) were the most frequent hard tissue injuries.

Management: Most facial fractures were managed conservatively, while soft tissue injuries often required wound care or suturing.

The study highlights the significant burden of e-scooter-related injuries on healthcare systems and underscores the need for safety interventions, such as mandatory helmet use, dedicated e-scooter lanes, and improved road conditions.

This cohort study included 120 MFT patients treated according to AO principles. Preoperative and four-week postoperative pain on the VAS-NRS, and MBF were measured to calculate MCIDs as indicators of functional rehabilitation. The patient?s perspective of the treatment was assessed using a four-item anchor question. The MCID was determined by two anchor-based approaches, namely, the change difference (CD) method and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve method. According to the CD method, the MCID for pain was 2.4 and the MBF was 147.9 N. Based on the ROC curve, the MCID for pain was 2.5 (sensitivity 91.7%, specificity 47.2%) and MBF was 159.1 N (sensitivity 71.4%, specificity 61.1%). This study demonstrated a high sensitivity (>70%) for MCID, which implies that pain reduction of 2.4?2.5 points on the VAS-NRS and a gain in MBF of 147.9?159.1N are clinically relevant for patients treated for MFT.","Introduction
Traditional research in maxillofacial trauma (MFT) has focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that demonstrate ‘statistically significant’ evaluations of parameters such as pain, functional activity, disfigurement, and bite force as measures to gauge treatment success.1 In the present era of evidence-based practice, treatment outcomes are solely guided by these statistically significant values (p values), largely ignoring their clinical relevance.2 Ideally, the clinical relevance of any treatment is judged by the patient’s self-perception of the intervention and results.3 This is more relevant for maxillofacial injuries, as they result in functional and aesthetic deformities leading to psychological trauma and sunken self-esteem, which forms a breeding ground for long-lasting physical, psychological, functional, and social disability.1
Although attempts have been made to capture the patient’s perception of treatment in the form of quality of life (QoL) studies, there is yet a need to place patients and patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as self-reported health status questionnaires, the Patient Specific Function Scale, and Pain Disability Index, at the core of research.4–6 This would refine patient care by assessing treatment outcomes from the patient’s own perspective, with greater reliability and consistency than traditional research outcomes. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) in the form of categorical endpoints, such as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), reflect the change in the clinical state of the patient as perceived by the patient in response to their treatment.7 The MCID is a patient-based measure that objectivises the clinically relevant change perceived by the patient themselves after a treatment. Various approaches have been described for its calculation with their inherent pros and cons, but none has been accepted as best.8
The MCID has been widely used in various surgical specialties such as orthopaedics, neurosurgery, and otorhinolaryngology, to gauge treatment relevance and to reframe the management protocol and follow-up schedule and duration.9–14 It is high time that maxillofacial literature placed emphasis on such studies, as there is only meagre evidence relating to MCID in relation to oral submucous fibrosis, temporomandibular disorders, and rhinosinusitis.15–17
Through this cohort study we therefore aimed to determine the MCID for pain and mean bite force (MBF) in patients treated for MFT to establish a minimum threshold for successful functional rehabilitation from the patients’ point of view.
Material and methods
A prospective single-centre, cohort study (pre-post intervention evaluation) was designed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, strictly abiding by the STROBE guidelines after obtaining institutional ethics clearance (AIIMS/IEC/2019-20/988). All patients with MFT who presented within 72 hours of injury to the Emergency & Trauma Centre and Department of Dentistry of a tertiary hospital from September 2020 to December 2021 were assessed.
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II patients aged between 18 and 65 years, with no pre-existing maxillofacial pathologies or pain syndromes were included in the study. Intubated, tracheostomised, intoxicated patients, or those with debilitating concomitant injuries, were excluded. After the initial assessment as per the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol, a total of 149 patients was screened, and 120 MFT patients were enrolled in the study. All 120 received standard care according to AO principles. Patients with fractures of the nasal bones, mandibular condylar head, and isolated zygomatic arch were treated by closed reduction under local anaesthesia. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with miniplates (Ortho Max system), under general anaesthesia were done in the rest of the cases. Post-surgical analgesia was achieved with 75 mg diclofenac sodium intravenous injection 12-hourly for three days, and patients were discharged on postoperative day three on oral analgesics (aceclofenac 100 mg twice daily for 3 days). Patients were kept on regular weekly follow up to address any discrepancies in occlusion, mouth opening, unassisted functional jaw movements, and paraesthesia.
The following parameters were recorded preoperatively (T1) and at four weeks postoperatively (T2).
1.        
VAS-NRS (visual analogue scale – numerical rating scale):18 pain was measured during unassisted jaw movements (mouth opening, protrusion and lateral excursion). The VAS-NRS scale (0: no pain – 10: most severe pain) was augmented with customised pictographic representation for easy comprehension.
2.        
Bite force was measured using the FlexiForce™ (Tekscan Inc) sensor at the right and left molar region by making the patient occlude on the sensor for five seconds in an erect, neutral head position with the Frankfurt horizontal plane parallel to the ground. The average of both sides was considered as the MBF. The sensor could detect a range of bite forces from 0–1100 N with a calibration of 0.01 N. The FlexiForce™ sensor was standardised in 150 age and sex-matched healthy controls with no history of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome (MPDS), and no maxillofacial pathology affecting their masticatory efficiency.
3.        
The anchor instrument for MCID at T2: patients’ perception of treatment was evaluated through a four-item anchor question19 assessing the response to treatment as none (implying ineffective treatment), poor (suggesting unsatisfactory treatment with some effect), good (signifying satisfactory treatment), and excellent (indicating an ideal treatment response).
Taking the anchor instrument as a reference, the MCID was calculated statistically for pain and MBF.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 23 (IBM Corp). The MCID for pain and MBF were calculated by change difference (CD) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methods. In the CD method, the MCID was calculated by deriving the difference between the mean change in pain score and MBF value of all patients classified as ‘good’ and ‘excellent’. The Mann Whitney U test and t-test were applied to determine the statistical significance between these two groups.
For the ROC curve analysis, patients were grouped into ‘good’ and ‘excellent’ cohorts. Two graphs (one for VAS-NRS and one for MBF) were plotted with the distribution of change in VAS-NRS and MBF values in both groups. Subsequently, sensitivity and specificity for every cut-off in the change score were determined. Following this, to derive the ROC curve, the sensitivity (y-axis) was plotted against 1-specificity (x-axis) for every cut-off value. The value on the upper left corner of the ROC, which corresponded to the greatest sensitivity and a proximal value of specificity, was the MCID score.20 The area under the curve (AUC) was also determined from the plotted ROC curve.
Results
This study included 114 male and six female patients (mean (SD) age 31.7 (11.9) years), who were treated with closed reduction (9.2%) or open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) (90.8%). The sociodemographic data and trauma characteristics of the study population are depicted in Table 1.

Discussion
The MCID indicates the meaningful change in any clinical parameter perceived by patients after any treatment as an improvement or deterioration. It may or may not accord with the physicians’ metrics of success, and is thus a valuable tool with which to assess treatment relevance.
The MCID can be calculated by two different conceptual methods: anchor-based approaches (ABAs), or distributive-based approaches (DBAs). ABAs relate the change in PRO score to an external anchor, whereas the latter relate the change in PRO score to standard deviation (SD) or standard error of measurement (SEM). DBAs require larger sample sizes and are statistically robust. However, as they rely on SD and SEM, they loosely capture patients’ perceptions and thus restrict the purpose of the MCID.
To generate preliminary evidence for MCID values for pain and MBF in MFT, the present study employed two methods of the ABA, namely the CD and ROC curve.8,21 The MCID for pain by the CD method was estimated to be 2.47, which is in accordance with the MCID for acute pain of 0.8–4, as reported in the literature.22 However, the MCID scores for chronic pain ranged from 1.6–4.1 on the VAS-NRS.10,13,15,23 On comparing the MCID pain scores for different fracture patterns, there was a negligible variation of 2.3 and 2.4 for isolated midface and mandibular fractures, respectively. However, panfacial fractures presented a slightly higher value of 2.9, which can be correlated with the severity of trauma and extent of surgical repair.
The MCID for MBF helped to objectivise the treatment’s success in terms of functional restoration. The CD method resulted in an MCID value of 147.9 N. Since this study is a preliminary attempt to estimate MCID scores for MBF, to date we know of no evidence with which to compare the MCID values in this study. However, the bite force values reported in the literature after mandibular fractures were in a similar range.24,25 The MCID for the MBF of isolated midface fracture was 154.6 N, which approximated to that of isolated mandibular fractures (155.9 N). Supposedly due to the complexity of panfacial fractures, a lower value of 118.4 N was obtained. Nevertheless, the authors hypothesise that, irrespective of the fracture pattern, the MCID for MBF and pain would be in a comparable range, as the entire masticatory system (consisting of the maxilla, mandible, soft tissue attachments, muscles of mastication, and dentition) works as a single functional unit.
Although the CD method has been widely used, it carries innate discrepancies due to the arbitrary nature of the scales of the anchor instrument. Hence, the ROC curve method was also employed to redress MCID.
The ROC curve method assesses the sensitivity and specificity of the anchor, and the AUC signifies the probability of the derived MCID value to correctly differentiate the two consecutive levels on the anchor. An AUC value of >0.7 is considered acceptable.20 In the present study, from the ROC curve for pain, the MCID was equated to be 2.5, which explains that patients with an improvement in pain of >2.5 points reported ‘excellent’ treatment, and those with improvement of <2.5 points reported ‘good’ treatment (sensitivity 91.7%, specificity 47.2%). Similarly, in the ROC curve for MBF, the MCID was computed to be 159.1 N, which indicates that patients who achieved a gain in MBF of >159.1 N reported ‘excellent’ treatment and those who had a gain of <159.1 N reported ‘good’ treatment (sensitivity 71.4%, specificity 61.1%).
The ABA is highly influenced by the number of levels on the chosen external anchor.20 For instance an external anchor with a four-point scale will produce a smaller value than a two-point scale, as the change implied by the adjacent levels in a four-point scale will be smaller than those on a two-point scale. Thus, depending on the number of scales of the anchor instrument, the MCID calculated by the ABA varies.
The role of DBAs comes into view when the change in PRO is related to SD or SEM.20,26,27 Owing to the limitations of both ABAs and DBAs, a combination of methods will enable the robustness of results.28 Revicki et al advocated the use of an ABA to generate primary evidence for the MCID, and this can further be supported by a DBA to provide secondary evidence.8 Nevertheless, use of the Delphi method, which is a systematic consensus including multiple clinicians and researchers with a large study sample, is recommended to arrive at a single or a narrower range of MCID values.23
The ABA necessitates appropriate selection of the anchor. The present study used a patient-centred anchor instrument designed by Tubach et al,19 which captured the patients’ rating of response to treatment by assessing their existing condition to avoid inherent recall bias of the commonly used transition rating anchors.29 Patient-reported anchor questions give an additional advantage as the patients themselves determine if the clinical benefit of the treatment was good or not.
The present study has several strengths. It is, to our knowledge, the first study to assess the MCID in MFT, it has used two different methods of ABA, and the values obtained were in proximity to each other. An AUC of >0.7 in the ROC curves signifies the validity of the MCID values. The study strictly adhered to the ATLS and AO guidelines with stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, assessing only incident cases and thus minimising selection and channelling bias. The utilisation of the standard VAS-NRS, validated patient-centred anchor questions, and standardisation of the FlexiForce™ sensor curtailed detection bias. The anchor instrument and VAS-NRS captured the existing condition, curbing recall or responder bias. Lastly, the absence of any losses to follow up eliminated attrition bias.
The study has a few limitations as it is a highly sociodemographically skewed study sample from a single centre, and thus lacks external validity and generalisability. However, it lays a foundation for conducting multicentric analyses, with a large sample size to estimate the MCID for pain and MBF using DBAs to statistically augment the results obtained by ABAs. Further estimation of the MCID in a wider sociodemographic distribution would enable stratification of the MCID, which could be determined for varied clinical parameters in different surgical settings of the maxillofacial specialty. As depicted in the orthopaedic literature, MCID scores can have a significant impact on follow-up intervals, thereby reducing the economic burden on the health-care system.13 In agreement with evidence-based practices, future research on PROMs for patient-centred evidential care is recommended.

Traditional maxillofacial research has relied on randomized controlled trials assessing pain, functional activity, disfigurement, and bite force, but these measures often neglect the patient’s own assessment of treatment success. Recognizing that maxillofacial injuries can cause significant functional, aesthetic, and psychological challenges, the authors aimed to quantify patient-centered outcomes using MCID as a threshold for clinically meaningful improvement.

A prospective single-centre cohort study was conducted on 120 MFT patients, evaluated within 72 hours of injury and followed up at four weeks postoperatively. Patients received either closed reduction or open reduction internal fixation according to standard ATLS and AO guidelines. Pain was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS-NRS) and bite force assessed with a FlexiForce™ sensor, while a four-point anchor instrument gauged patient satisfaction. MCID values were calculated using the change difference (CD) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methods.

Results demonstrated significant improvement, with MCID for pain estimated at approximately 2.4–2.5 points and for MBF between 147.9 and 159.1 Newtons. The findings suggest that incorporating patient-reported outcome measures can better inform functional rehabilitation goals in MFT. Despite limitations of a single-centre design and sociodemographic skew, the study provides a foundation for multicentric research to refine MCID thresholds and enhance patient-centered care. This comprehensive research strongly highlights the need to incorporate patient perspectives into clinical decision-making.","This research paper investigates the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for pain and bite force in patients with maxillofacial trauma (MFT) after treatment.

The authors argue for incorporating patient-reported outcomes (PROs) like health status questionnaires to better assess treatment effectiveness from the patient's perspective. The MCID, a patient-based measure, quantifies the smallest change a patient perceives as beneficial.

The prospective cohort study enrolled 120 MFT patients and measured pain (VAS-NRS) and bite force pre- and post-operatively.

While limited by its single-center design and specific demographic, it establishes a foundation for future, larger-scale studies to validate and stratify MCID values in diverse clinical settings.","This research paper focuses on the importance of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in evaluating the success of treatments for maxillofacial trauma (MFT), emphasizing the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) as a key metric. Traditional research in MFT has relied on statistically significant outcomes, often overlooking the clinical relevance and patient perception of treatment success. The study highlights the need for incorporating PROs, such as quality of life (QoL) measures, to better assess treatment outcomes from the patient's perspective. The study aimed to determine the MCID for pain and mean bite force (MBF) in MFT patients, using a prospective cohort design. Patients were treated with either closed reduction or open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and their pain levels and MBF were measured preoperatively and four weeks postoperatively. The MCID was calculated using two methods: change difference (CD) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The results showed that the MCID for pain was 2.4 (CD method) and 2.5 (ROC method), while the MCID for MBF was 147.9 N (CD method) and 159.1 N (ROC method). These values indicate the minimum improvement in pain and MBF that patients perceive as meaningful.

The study underscores the importance of MCID in assessing treatment success from the patient's perspective, advocating for its use in future MFT research. It also highlights the need for multicentric studies with larger, more diverse samples to validate these findings and improve their generalizability.

We explored outcomes and the extent of nationwide interhospital variation for patients undergoing reconstructive surgery after oral cavity cancer (OCC) using the Dutch Head and Neck Audit (DHNA).,"Introduction
Oral cavity cancer (OCC) resections often lead to impaired speech, difficulty in swallowing, and physical deformities.1 Therefore, OCC patients require high-quality integrated care and follow up. Reducing the inter-hospital variety of such practices is a common starting point for quality-of-care improvement.2
With the aim of improving high-quality integrated care for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC), the Dutch Head and Neck Audit (DHNA) was founded in 2014. The DHNA, initiated by healthcare professionals, is a mandatory nationwide audit that measures quality of care and encompasses all 14 Dutch HNC care centres. National data on curative and palliative surgical and non-surgical treatment are collected. Improvement initiatives are developed based on diverse quality indicators3,4 drawing on the input of patients, medical specialists, and allied healthcare professionals.5,6
Surgical OCC defects are challenging and often require complex reconstructive techniques to restore form, function, and aesthetics. In the Netherlands reconstructive surgery is performed either by plastic surgeons or head and neck surgeons. The DHNA does not collect data at the surgeons’ level, but rather at the level of the centre. Currently, no standard exists on the most suitable technique for each tumour site, which results in variations in practice in the selection of strategies from the reconstructive ladder for OCC patients who require reconstruction.7–10
Although numerous studies on reconstructive surgery for HNC have been performed, literature is limited on the variation and outcomes after reconstructive surgery for OCC.11,12 Furthermore, current literature on flap techniques focuses on small populations that disregard HNC subsites.11–15
As a starting point for quality-of-care improvement, the present study examines nationwide inter-hospital variation and outcomes of reconstructive surgery after resection of primary OCC.
Material and methods
Patients and definitions
This study used DHNA data collected by an independent organisation (the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation) or in-house data managers.5
The cohort was selected using OCC codes (ICD-C00, C02-C04, C05.0, C5.8-9, C06.0-8), after which patients who had undergone curative-intent surgery for primary tumours with reconstruction and who had been diagnosed between 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2023, were included. Treatment included primary surgery and potentially adjuvant therapy. Comorbidities up to and including 2021 were registered using the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation (ACE-27).16 The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)17 was used thereafter. Disease stage was defined according to the eighth edition of the Union for International Cancer Control clinical TNM classification (cTNM8).18 We labelled March 2020 as the start of the COVID-19 pandemic based on patients’ first visits and treatment initiation, in line with Dutch lockdown restrictions.19 Centres were grouped according to the eight head and neck care groups (an oncological centre and their preferred partner combination), labelled anonymously as A to H.
Reconstructive interventions following resection included the complete reconstructive ladder ranging from skin grafting, local transposition and pedicled flaps (pectoralis major, supraclavicular flaps) to free flaps. Within the DHNA, free flap reconstructions are categorised as free radial forearm (FRFF), anterolateral thigh (ALT), fibular – with or without a skin paddle, and “other” (latissimus dorsi or deep circumflex iliac artery flap).
Surgical complications within 30 days after free flap reconstruction were scored with the Clavien Dindo (CD) classification.20 Flap revision surgery was categorised as anastomosis revision (G1), partial loss with successful revision (G2), or total flap loss (G3). Complications were scored as major in cases with CD 3–5, fistulas demanding reintervention, and G2-G3 flap revision surgery.
No ethics approval or informed consent was required according to Dutch law, as data were processed anonymously within the national quality registry and thereby did not fall under the scope of the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to compare distributions and frequencies within reconstruction subgroups. Data handling and statistical analyses were performed using the R studio software system for statistical computing version 4.2.1 (R Core Team (2021). R: a language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL https://www.R-project.org/).
The objectives were analysed by comparing groups using the chi-squared test for categorical variables. For continuous variables, one-way ANOVA (normally distributed data) and Kruskal-Wallis tests (non-normally distributed data) were used. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Using univariable logistic regression, significance of inter-hospital variance (centres as independent variables) in outcomes (dependent variable) was quantified by ANOVA testing.
As sensitivity analysis, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, Fisher's exact tests, or Pearson's chi-squared tests were used to check for demographic differences in pre-COVID, COVID, and post-COVID cohorts.
Flap-revision surgery within 30 days postoperatively was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The numbers at risk were stratified per degree of flap-revision surgery (G1, G2, G3).
Results
Patients and tumour characteristics
Of the 3,339 records in the DHNA, 1,383 patients were eligible for inclusion (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 Flowchart showing the selection process of this cohort within the Dutch Head and Neck Audit (DHNA).
Patients were predominantly male (57.1%), with a median (IQR) age of 67 (59–74) years (Table 1). For 94.4% of patients, data on smoking habits were available, with 41.4% being current smokers, 34.5% former smokers, and 18.5% non-smokers. Thirty-seven per cent of patients had early-stage disease (0–II), including 10 patients with initial cTx, cTis, or cT0. Four per cent concerned cTNM8 stage 4b tumours. Significant inter-hospital variation was observed for patients' smoking habits and comorbidity scores (with unknowns in 0–19.0% and 28.9–71.7% of patients, respectively). Clinical and pathological tumour stage distributions also varied widely (Table 1) with one centre not performing free flap reconstructions and mostly treating local disease (66.7%).

Besides a significantly lower proportion of missing comorbidity scores after COVID (p < 0.001) and a slight increase in higher age (p = 0.033), there were no statistically significant differences between patients treated before, during, or after the COVID-19 pandemic had started regarding patient, tumour, and treatment characteristics (p ≥ 0.4, Supplemental Table A).
Reconstruction characteristics
With 70.4% (n = 974), free flaps were the most frequently used reconstructive surgery technique in our cohort (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Fig. I). The most performed free flap was the FRFF (54.7%; range 37.1–80.8%), followed by Fibula and ALT flaps (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Fig. I).

Fig. 2 Reconstructive surgery after curative-intent surgery for primary oral cavity cancer: average distribution and inter-hospital variation (range in %) of overall type of reconstructions (left) and free flap subtypes (right) for the majority (70.6%) of patients. (FRFF: free radial forearm flap; ALT: anterolateral thigh flap; Fibula: fibular flap with or without skin graft).
Over the years, free flap distributions did not differ significantly. In 2018, an average of 48.5% concerned the FRFF and 21.3% the ALT. In 2020 these were 56.2% and 15.0%, respectively, and in 2022 they were 58.7% and 16.8%, respectively. Except for one lower volume centre (53 primary reconstructions) with equivalent FRFF and ALT rates, all centres predominantly used the FRFF.
The association between clinical tumour stage and reconstructive strategy was studied (Fig. 3). The widest variation was observed in patients with stage I tumours (n = 140, 10.1%, Supplemental Fig. II), with local transposition being used the most (42.6%), together with a relatively large proportion of “other” techniques (Bichat’s fat pads). Two HNC-care groups (Supplemental Fig. II, groups B and C) only performed local transpositions (group B) or mainly skin grafts (group C) and no free flaps for cTNM stage I resections. Within the local disease group (stage ≤II, n = 509), inter-HNC-care group variation was mostly based on whether local transposition or skin grafting was the second most performed technique (Supplemental Fig. II). In higher disease stages, free flaps were used more often (65.4% in stage II and up to 89.2% in stage III, Fig. 3). In the case of stage IV tumours, increasing rates of pedicled flaps were used.

All patients are stratified per cTNM8 (left, n = 1371; cTNM stage was missing n = 12). Patients are grouped per head and neck oncological care group based on cTNM8 into local disease (TNM stage ≤II, n = 509) and advanced disease (cTNM stage III and IV, n = 862).
Free flap complications
Of the 974 free flap reconstructions performed in 13 of the 14 centres, 34.0% of patients had a postoperative complication (range 19.4–66.7%) and 17.7% (n = 172/974) underwent an unplanned reoperation (range 0.0–32.1%, p = 0.992). These reoperations were mainly performed due to one or more complication (98.2%). In 13 patients reoperation was performed to establish sufficient margins due to an irradical tumour resection during the primary operation.
For reconstruction-related complications (n = 331, 34.0% of the cohort), 49% were major (CD ≥3). Postoperative haematoma was the most common, requiring surgery in 74.0% (n = 77/104). Thirty patients developed a fistula (inter-hospital range 0–20%).
Revisional surgery was performed in 9.2% (n = 90/974) of free flaps (Supplemental Table B) with successful anastomosis revision in 3.9% (n = 38, G1). In 14 patients (1.4%) partial loss was observed with successful revision surgery (G2), and in 3.9% (n = 38) the flap was lost (G3). Inter-hospital variation in these outcomes ranged from 0–12.5% for G2 and 0–30.0% for G3 (for G2 and G3, p = 0.0049; Supplemental Table B). Funnel plot analysis could not be performed due to low event incidence (n < 10). Of the anastomosis revisions (G1) 89.5% occurred within the first postoperative week versus 57.1% of successful revisions (G2) and 65.8% of total flap loss despite revision (G3) (Fig. 4, Supplemental Figure 3). Median time-to-flap-revision was 1.0 day postoperative in G1, 5.5 days in G2 and 5.0 days in G3.

Discussion
We performed a nationwide audit on reconstructive surgery after primary OCC resection in the Netherlands. Patients with OCC are treated in a highly centralised setting with 14 DHNA-compliant centres. Reconstruction techniques varied among hospitals. Although confounding and predictive factors for the practice variation between centres could not be studied, strategies were assessed per T stage. Overall, local transposition was preferred for stage I tumours. For higher T-stages, free flap reconstructions were mostly used, especially FRFFs. Aggregated free flap failure rates were in line with previously reported international rates. However, flap failure percentages varied widely across centres, showing questionable and high inter-hospital outcome variation.
Patient and flap selection
The DHNA focuses on primary tumours, which makes our outcomes not suitable for a debate on overall volume norms for HNC reconstructive surgery. To improve homogeneity, other HNC subsites were excluded.
After the introduction of the CCI from 2022 onwards, data on comorbidities were missing for <42%, providing a significant improvement compared with missing data on >50% before then.
The distributions of free flaps showed that the FRFF was used most often. However, flap choice is dependent on the defect21 and the surgeon’s preference. Questions arise as to whether variation was based on specialty preferences (for example, ablative or reconstructive surgery) or other influences.9,10 Results will be used to improve registration and data quality further. A surgeon's training/specialty is currently not registered but could be included in future.
A few patients staged as cTis, cTx, and T0 were still included as they may have previously undergone biopsy or excision elsewhere. In HNC, stage 4b tumours are considered incurable and inoperable. Against our expectations, 52 patients (50% based on N3 stage) within the study cohort were cT4b. Six centres even exceeded the national average of 5% cTNM IVb tumours, with percentages up to 21%. An increasing percentage of pedicled flaps were used in this group, perhaps as part of salvage procedures to improve outcomes and quality of remaining life expectancy. This group of patients is of great interest for a future focus study to find out whether palliative resection followed by reconstruction is worth the investment.
Postoperative outcomes
Overall complication rates were significantly lower than those in the United Kingdom (UK) National Flap Registry,15,22 with 69.9% of patients in the UK having at least one complication compared with our 34.0%. Although their 4.3% flap loss was comparable, complications were more often major (CD ≥3) in our population (49% vs their 37.5%). Discrepancies may be explained by pulmonary complications registered in the UK flap registry (observed in 24.4% of patients).15 Our flap success rate aligns with available literature, although it is hard to compare due to different definitions and inclusion criteria.9,11–15
Time to event for flap loss generally occurs within the first 48 hours postoperatively underscoring the importance of the postoperative monitoring of flaps.21 Flap monitoring is often performed clinically every few hours in the first days and is quite intensive for staff.21 Although flap loss after one week is rare, it can occur due to an infection or abscess.23,24 Monitoring is especially important within the first week since 89.5% of G1 revisional surgeries were performed herein and over half of G2 and G3 revisional surgery occurred herein. Since flap loss is registered on the date of revision surgery instead of on the occurrence of preceding symptoms, it is likely that flap loss intervals could be overestimated.
Independent data-entry professionals from the National Cancer Registry perform DHNA data registration. However, the observed zero flap failures in several centres could indicate under-reporting of minor complication rates. Although trained data managers collect all relevant clinical data within most HNC centres, they rely on electronic health records and might miss data if not structurally registered. Nonetheless, major complications with the most prominent clinical impact are structurally recorded in most centres. Clear definitions, standardised electronic health record systems, and the use of artificial intelligence can aid the registration of complications.25 These topics are currently being reviewed within the DHNA group.
Impact on the registry
Registries provide real-world data that can drive a quality improvement cycle locally and nationally. Registries are considered vital for the next generation of value-based healthcare as well as, for example, trials within cohorts to drive improvements in care. In HNC, registries are rare. Frequent analyses are vital to improve a registry, as they uncover areas to improve data capture, data definitions, and clinical aspects, by comparing outcomes.
As a result of the outcomes of this study, six-monthly nationwide feedback sessions are now held to enhance data reliability and stimulate open conversations about the observed data. The reduction in missing data on comorbidities is an example of the positive effects of these sessions. We aim to maintain nationwide coverage and to improve data quantity and quality aided by funnel plot analysis, the most commonly used technique for the visualisation of inter-hospital variation.26 Case-mix correction for complication and flap failure rates should be assessed to enable preoperative and postoperative risk assessment.5,27,28 In the future, functional and quality-of-life-related outcomes, which are now being incorporated in the DHNA, would be more relevant to discuss in terms of patient success.29
Conclusion
This nationwide study evaluated practice variation in OCC reconstructive surgery, including applied free flap subtypes and surgical outcomes. These results highlight the need for improvements in national data quality and the need to stimulate the exchange of improvement processes among centres.

To address this, the Dutch Head and Neck Audit (DHNA), initiated in 2014, was established to standardize and improve care across the 14 Dutch head and neck cancer (HNC) centers. This nationwide study analyzes inter-hospital variations and outcomes in reconstructive surgery following primary OCC resection, focusing on both curative and palliative interventions.

Patients diagnosed between January 2018 and January 2023 were identified using specific OCC ICD codes, with reconstruction techniques ranging from skin grafting and local transpositions to complex free flap procedures such as free radial forearm, anterolateral thigh, and fibular flaps. Data on patient demographics, tumor stage (cTNM8 and pTNM8), comorbidities, and treatment modalities were collected. Statistical analyses, including chi-squared tests, ANOVA, and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, were applied to assess variations in practice and outcomes.

Results indicated significant inter-hospital variability in patient characteristics, reconstructive strategies, and postoperative outcomes. Free flaps were used in over 70% of cases, with the free radial forearm flap most common. Lower-stage tumors were more often managed with local transpositions, while advanced tumors predominantly received free flaps. Notably, the overall complication rate was 34%, with substantial differences in flap revision and failure rates among centers.

The study underscores the need for enhanced data quality, standardization of surgical practices, and regular feedback to drive quality improvement in OCC reconstructive care. Future efforts will focus on incorporating functional and quality-of-life outcomes to further refine patient-centered treatment approaches, with improved outcomes.","This Dutch study analyzes nationwide variations and outcomes in reconstructive surgery after oral cavity cancer (OCC) resections using data from the Dutch Head and Neck Audit (DHNA). Examining over 1300 patients who underwent curative surgery with reconstruction between 2018-2023, the study reveals significant inter-hospital variation in patient characteristics like smoking habits and comorbidity. Free flaps, especially the free radial forearm flap (FRFF), were the most common reconstruction technique. While overall complication rates were lower than those reported in the UK, major complications were more frequent. Flap failure rates varied widely across centers, raising concerns about inter-hospital outcome variation. The study emphasizes the need to improve national data quality, standardize definitions, and encourage open discussion among centers to enhance quality of care and patient outcomes.

The study aims to improve the quality of care for OCC patients by analyzing inter-hospital differences in reconstructive techniques and surgical outcomes. The DHNA, a nationwide audit, collects data from 14 head and neck cancer care centers, focusing on curative and palliative treatments. The study included 1,383 patients who underwent curative-intent surgery with reconstruction between 2018 and 2023. The findings reveal significant variation in reconstructive techniques across hospitals, with free flaps being the most common (70.4%), particularly the free radial forearm flap (FRFF). Local transposition was preferred for early-stage tumors, while free flaps were more frequent for advanced stages. Postoperative complications occurred in 34% of free flap cases, with 17.7% requiring unplanned reoperations. Flap failure rates varied widely among centers, raising concerns about consistency in outcomes. The study also highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on data quality, with improved comorbidity recording post-pandemic.

The paper underscores the importance of standardized data collection and inter-hospital collaboration to enhance surgical outcomes and reduce practice variation. It calls for future research to incorporate functional and quality-of-life measures, which are increasingly relevant for patient-centered care.

With the advancement of new technologies and the increasing use of sustainable energy sources, electrically powered vehicles, such as the electric-scooter (e-scooter), have gradually risen on a large scale. These means of transportation can be purchased privately or rented temporarily through user-friendly mobile phone applications.1 However, the lack of regulations such as dedicated lanes and mandatory helmet wearing is a significant issue. Furthermore, the e-scooter design itself contributes to the inadequacy of safety.2 The number of road accidents involving e-scooters is increasing, either in isolation or involving pedestrians and other vehicles.3 Drivers often report multiple traumas of different areas of the body, which are frequently severe injuries, that depend strictly upon the safety of the mean of transportation; however, the face remains undoubtedly the most exposed region, involving both hard and soft tissues.4 The concomitance of potentially life-threatening situations should be considered and faced with caution.5,6 E-scooter accidents are often correlated with the driver’s concomitant use of alcohol or drugs.7 The need to characterise this type of road accident provided the rationale for this study, which is aimed at assessing the most common types of fracture and their severity. The study also seeks to identify the greatest risk factors, such as alterations in mental state and the absence of a helmet, in order to support the development of correct road rules. Age, gender, time of day, and circumstances were also recorded to evaluate the context in which these accidents most frequently occur.
Materials and Methods
An observational, retrospective, multicentre study was carried out at the Maxillofacial Surgery Unit of the following Italian hospitals: “AOU Luigi Vanvitelli”, “AORN Cardarelli” and “P.O. Ospedale del Mare” in Naples, “AUSL Bellaria-Maggiore” in Bologna, “AOU Mater Domini” in Catanzaro, “AOU G. Martino” in Messina. Patients involved in road accidents by electric scooter from January 2020 to January 2024 were enrolled and were selected according to the following inclusion criteria:
-        
Road traffic accident with electric scooter
-        
Facial fracture documented by radiographic (CT) images
-        
Age between 18 and 60 years
-        
Absence of congenital facial malformations
-        
Psychophysical fitness for driving a vehicle.
The aim of the study was to analyse the types of facial fractures related to road traffic accidents in specific circumstances to outline the need for dedicated regulations for e-scooter use. Data collected included age, gender, time, month, and circumstances of the accident, helmet use, alcohol and/or drug use, fracture site, presence and size of facial injuries, and any other fracture sites involved. In addition, the time between the injury and the surgery, and the duration of time spent as an inpatient were recorded. This information was obtained by consulting medical records and directly interviewing patients, which were considered true based on their statements.
The FISS (Facial Injury Severity Scale) (Table 1) developed by Bagheri et al was used to define the severity of trauma: mild (FISS score 1-3), moderate (FISS score 4-7) or severe (FISS score 8-15).8 For each subject, a final score based on the type of fracture sustained was calculated according to three regions of the face (Mandible, Mid-face, Upper face). Facial lacerations that extended for more than 10 cm were also included. These data were processed after acquiring the patient’s CT images.

Results
A cohort of 61 patients who incurred facial trauma following a traffic accident with an electric scooter was enrolled. Fifty patients were included in the study, while 11 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria. Thirty-seven subjects were male, and the average age was 34.76 years. A total of 38 traffic accidents occurred during Spring or Summer (March 21-September 22), they were more common between 8 am and 8 pm (n = 30) and during the weekend (Friday to Sunday) (n = 27). Twenty-six traffic accidents involved other vehicles. The e-vehicles were rented in 33 cases. At the time of the event, 43 patient subjects were not wearing helmets, five patients were drunk, and three patients were under the influence of narcotic substances (Table 2). In order of frequency, facial fractures involved were: zygomatico-maxillary-orbital complex (ZMOC) (n = 16), mandibular condyle (n = 13), nasal bone (n = 11), orbital floor (n = 8), and mandibular body (n = 7). Facial fractures such as Le Fort I (n = 4), naso-orbito-ethmoidal (NOE) (n = 4) and mandibular ramus (n = 4) were less common. Other types were rarely detected: Le Fort II (n = 3), mandibular symphysis or parasymphysis (n = 2), lateral orbital wall (n = 2), orbital roof (n = 2), zygomatic arch (n = 2), dentoalveolar (n = 2), nasal spine (n = 2), medial orbital wall (n = 1), Le Fort III (n = 1), and maxillary sinus walls (n = 1). Thirty patients reported multiple facial fractures, involving two different anatomical sites (n = 25) or three different anatomical sites (n = 5). Trauma affected the right side in 27 cases, the left side in 27 cases, the midline in 12 cases and was bilateral in 19 cases (considering that some drivers had fractures of multiple facial anatomical sites). The presence of facial lacerations > 10 cm was also assessed and detected in 16 subjects. The FISS (Facial Injury Severity Scale) score was between 1 and 3 in 32 patients (low), between 4 and 7 in 16 patients (medium) and between 8 and 15 in two patients (high). A total of 14 drivers suffered polytrauma, also reporting fractures in other body area (n = 6 to upper limbs, n = 4 to lower limbs, n = 3 to ribs, n = 1 to pelvis); a pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum was detected in one patient. Considering the clinical assessment and the absence of emergency room in some of the hospitals involved, the time from injury to surgery differed: <24 hours (h) (n = 5), 24–48 h (n = 2), 48–72 h (n = 19), >72 h (n = 24). Following the surgical procedure, 15 patients totalled <5 days of hospitalisation, 22 patients totalled from 5 to 10 days of hospitalisation and 13 patients stayed for more than 10 days in the hospital (Table 3).

Discussion
Patients from six different hospitals, located in both northern and southern Italy, were included in this multicentre study. The largest part of the selected cohort was composed of male and young patients (mean age 34 years), as has also been reported in the literature.9 The majority of road accidents occurred during the spring-summer seasons and in the 8 am to 8 pm time range; instead, Kowalczewska et al report that the frequency increased during the night and winter seasons due to poor conditions.3 The discrepancy in these data could be related to different population habits and climatic conditions in relation to geographical location. About half of the traffic accidents occurred through the collision with infrastructure or pedestrians while the remaining half involved other vehicles. According to Stigson et al, accidents did not involve third parties in about 95.3% of cases10 and Trivedi et al cite autonomous accident as the most frequent dynamic in e-scooter accidents.11 The e-scooter was rented in most cases, in agreement with a study conducted by Haworth et al, which recorded a higher number of shared electric scooters.12 In Italy, the purchase of these vehicles is yet to be widespread, while rental agencies have grown significantly in the last few years internationally, increasing the number of inexperienced drivers.13 However, not enough data have been reported on accidents involving the driver-owned electric transport vehicles. The results of this study show that seven out of 50 drivers wore helmets; according to Hamzani et al only 1.3%-4.5% of electric vehicle drivers routinely wore helmets.14 In Italy, a driver's license is not currently required, helmets are mandatory only for those under 18 years old and the vehicles are allowed on pavements, pedestrian areas, and urban streets. Nonetheless, laws may change in 2024, making helmets mandatory for all age groups.15
A study conducted on motorcyclists showed that the model of helmet used (full-face or open-face) influenced the severity of facial trauma. The most popular helmets, in fact, protect against head trauma but not against fracture of facial bones.16 Five patients in this cohort were under the influence of alcohol. Toofany et al report the average percentage of e-scooter accidents recorded under the influence of alcohol was 26.5%.17 In Finland this percentage increased considerably to 71%.5 Instead in Israel, where alcohol is forbidden for religious purposes, these accidents were less common.12 The lower percentage in our analysis (10%) is probably connected to different cultural habits and rules. Three patients were under the influence of drugs. Dhillon et al report that only 17.2% of the sample had a positive urine toxicology result and cannabis was the most common drug.18 ZMOC fracture affected most of the e-scooter drivers; fractures of nasal bones, mandibular condyle, mandibular body and orbital floor were also very common. Le Fort I, NOE, and mandibular ramus fractures involved fewer drivers while the other types were rarely recorded. Despite discordance among some authors, in general the data regarding the frequency of facial fractures reported in this study are in agreement with the literature. According to Hyeon Seok et al and Yarmohammadi et al orbital fractures were the most frequently recorded, followed immediately by mid-face fractures.19,20 A study conducted in Poland reports the mandibular fracture as the most frequent (37.5%), while ZMOC fractures involved 20% of the total sample.3 In Korea, however, nasal bone fractures were the most common, followed by maxillary and mandibular bone fractures.21 In addition, most of the selected cohort reported facial fractures involving two or three anatomical regions. The literature shows that e-scooter drivers are more exposed to head and facial trauma due to direct impact,22 also considering the structural characteristics of the vehicle (Fig. 1).23

Fig. 1 Technical opinion of the specialist engineer.
To assess the severity of facial trauma, a score based on the Facial Injury Severity Scale (FISS) was calculated for each patient; therefore, the presence of any facial lacerations >10 cm was noted. Mild-grade facial trauma affected most of the cohort, followed by medium-grade severity. Data from this study confirm that traffic accidents involving these vehicles very rarely cause severe or life-threatening traumatic events, however the frequency is significantly increasing.24 Van der Zaag et al used FISS to assess the severity of facial trauma related to conventional bicycles and e-bikes, confirming that low/moderate grade was the most common among drivers of e-vehicles, but these were more frequently involved in road accidents.25 No other articles were found in which e-scooter-related facial trauma was assessed by FISS. Fourteen patients reported multiple traumas in other body areas which, in order of frequency were: lower and upper limbs, ribs, and pelvic bones, in agreement with Bentham et al.26 One patient reported a pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum. It was not possible to assess the presence of head trauma immediately because some of the hospitals participating in this study did not have an emergency room (ER). Head injuries are frequently associated with these traffic accidents, making it useful to perform computed tomography (CT) and preliminary neurological evaluation.27,28 Most of the cohort underwent surgery more than 72h after the time of injury and five patients before 24h. This result, too, is probably attributable to the absence of an ER in some of the hospitals involved. The lack of roads rules and the reduced use of a belay device led to an increasing cost and duration of time spent in hopital. In our review every patient required some days of hospitalisation, the mean time of which was 8.3 days, except in cases of polytrauma or multiple maxillary-facial fractures, where it was 31 days. In particular, Lee et al underlined how injuries involving motorised scooters were more severe than that of nonmotorised ones.29
Limits of this study relate to the low sample size despite the widespread use of these vehicles. Some patients were excluded either because they did not meet the inclusion criteria or all the necessary information was not collected. The discrepancy with some data in the literature is probably caused by the involvement of hospitals located in Italian cities with different living and working habits, climatic conditions, and infrastructure.
Conclusions
In this study, ZMOC fractures were the most common overall, while nasal bones, orbital floor, mandibular condyle, and body fractures were also common among e-scooter drivers. The circumstances of the injury were also described to improve the management of patients, encourage the introduction of efficient regulations, reduce the number and duration of associated hospitalisations. An interesting prospect could be the inclusion in future studies of any facial fractures sustained by drivers of different vehicles and pedestrians, to improve safety and expand the epidemiological data available to maxillofacial surgeons.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission
Because it was a retrospective study, it was not necessary to apply to the ethics committee. Patient permission obtained.","This multicentre retrospective observational study assessed facial fractures in e-scooter accidents to highlight the urgent need for improved safety regulations. As e-scooters become increasingly popular through private ownership and rental services, their usage without proper safety measures—such as dedicated lanes and mandatory helmet use—has led to a rise in road accidents with significant maxillofacial trauma. The study, conducted from January 2020 to January 2024 in six Italian hospitals, enrolled patients aged 18 to 60 who sustained facial fractures confirmed by CT imaging after e-scooter accidents. Detailed data were collected on demographics, accident timing (notably more frequent during spring-summer, between 8 am and 8 pm, and on weekends), helmet usage, and the influence of alcohol or drugs, along with the specific fracture types.

Out of 61 patients, 50 met the inclusion criteria, with a majority being male (74%) and an average age of approximately 35 years. The results revealed that only 14% of the riders wore helmets, while a small proportion had consumed alcohol or drugs at the time of the accident. The most common injuries involved the zygomatico-maxillary-orbital complex, followed by fractures of the mandibular condyle, nasal bone, orbital floor, and mandibular body. The Facial Injury Severity Scale (FISS) classified most injuries as low or moderate, though several patients experienced multiple fractures and polytrauma, leading to prolonged hospital stays.

The findings underscore the critical need for revised road safety regulations and mandatory helmet use to reduce the frequency and severity of facial injuries related to e-scooter accidents.","This retrospective, multicenter study investigated facial fractures resulting from e-scooter accidents in Italy from 2020-2024. Researchers analyzed data from 50 patients aged 18-60 who sustained facial fractures in e-scooter accidents, focusing on fracture types, severity (using the FISS scale), risk factors, and accident circumstances. The study found that most accidents occurred during spring/summer, between 8 am and 8 pm, and on weekends. A significant majority weren't wearing helmets, and some involved alcohol or drug use. The most frequent fractures involved the zygomatico-maxillary-orbital complex (ZMOC), followed by mandibular condyle and nasal bone fractures. Most injuries were classified as mild to moderate in severity. The study highlights the increasing frequency of e-scooter-related facial trauma and the need for stricter regulations, including mandatory helmet use, to improve rider safety and reduce hospitalizations. The authors suggest future studies could compare facial fractures sustained by e-scooter drivers to those sustained by drivers of other vehicles or to pedestrians.","This research paper investigates facial fractures resulting from electric scooter (e-scooter) accidents, highlighting the increasing prevalence of such injuries due to the rising use of e-scooters and the lack of stringent safety regulations.

To our knowledge few studies in the international scientific literature have evaluated the surgical and theoretical progression of surgical trainees, particularly in the specialty of maxillofacial surgery. This scarcity is especially apparent when considering the evaluation of residents' progress. In the last decade we could find only one study on the digital assessment of basic surgical procedures in maxillofacial trainees using a mobile application. However, this study focused solely on practical activities, neglecting the crucial aspect of good surgical planning, which stems from the acquisition of theoretical knowledge and the ability to make appropriate surgical decisions.1
It is crucial to identify an assessment tool that can effectively evaluate didactic-theoretical advancement and surgical proficiency of the trainees.2
Our study sought to address three key questions regarding the training of resident maxillofacial surgeons: How can training outcomes be enhanced? What strategies are conducive to directing learning effectively? How can residents be empowered in clinical and surgical practice?
The authors aimed to devise an impartial method to enhance the acquisition of skills among maxillofacial surgery trainees. This unique tool is intended to comprehensively evaluate theoretical and practical progress. Through its implementation, specialist training activities can be optimised, emphasising efficiency and targeting the development of skills in areas that require additional exploration. Additionally, individual skill improvement can be prioritised.
Material and methods
A prospective multicentre pilot study was conducted from January 2022 to December 2023 by the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria delle Marche in Ancona. The evaluation tool, designed to assess advancement in maxillofacial traumatology in doctors undergoing specialist training, incorporated an evaluation and self-assessment test (Supplemental File 1). This tool was developed using AO trauma surgery references as a scientific framework.3
The study involved seven trainees from the School of Maxillofacial Surgery at the University of Siena who volunteered for the evaluation, along with a single volunteer tutor for each network training school location. Tutors were responsible for assessing both the theoretical and practical performance of the trainees involved.
Throughout the study, 189 traumas were deemed suitable for test evaluation across all the training network locations. These traumas were organised into 27 groups, each containing seven traumas presented in chronological order. Each resident was assigned a trauma from each group, and evaluation and self-assessment tests were conducted for each trauma. To qualify for the test, traumas had to be surgically relevant, referred for treatment, and involve the specialist training doctor as the primary surgeon with assistance from the referral tutor. Traumas requiring urgent attention or those not performed directly by the trainees were excluded.
For each group, the arithmetic mean of the scores obtained by the trainees was calculated. Subsequently, the data were processed into tables and graphs to evaluate trends. Additionally, at the study's conclusion, each trainee provided feedback on the usefulness of the evaluation and self-assessment test to identify critical issues that needed resolution. Feedback was based on three statements: I found the test easy to understand and complete; I found the test useful for measuring my skills; and I found the test useful for improving my skills. Responses were recorded on a Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree (Supplemental File 2). 4
Evaluation test structure and how to conduct the test
The test was divided into three distinct sections, each assessing a specific theoretical-practical area (Supplemental File 1).
Section 1. Focus: preliminary phase of maxillofacial trauma management
Trainee task: Answer five open-ended questions on surgical fracture identification, classification, and treatment planning. Complete this section independently, relying on theoretical knowledge of traumatology.
Tutor task: Review and score each question from 1 to 5 based on the Likert scale.4
Section 2. Focus: surgical behaviour assessment during the planned procedure
Trainee task: Perform the surgical procedure as the first operator, following the previously planned approach.
Tutor task: Observe the trainee during the surgery. Evaluate and score the surgical behaviour from 1 to 5 after the procedure.4
Section 3. Focus: final evaluation from initial assessment to postoperative radiological results
Trainee task: Provide a self-assessment score for the final question.
Tutor task: Assess the overall process from initial evaluation to postoperative radiological results. Score each question from 1 to 5.4
Rating scale
A simple progressive numerical scale based on Likert theory.4
Scores range from 1 (indicating inconsistency in competence) to 5 (indicating maximum competence).
Total possible points range from 14 to 70, based on the sum of the points from each section.
Overall assessment
Scores for each procedure are chronologically arranged and entered into a table to track progress in the learning curve.
Results
The study involved 189 cases managed by the resident-tutor pairs, with each case undergoing a digital evaluation and self-assessment test. The arithmetic mean of the scores obtained by the trainees was computed for each of the 27 groups. The total mean scores are summarised in Table 1. These scores were recorded chronologically to analyse progression. Graphical representations were generated from the data collected, illustrating the trend of the numerical scores over time. A gradual progression was noted in all sections examined.

Analysis of the obtained data revealed significant improvements across the duration of the study. In the first section, the average percentage score of the initial group was 75%. This progressively increased to 98.9% in the last group, an overall increase of 23.9%. In the second section, the average percentage score began at 63.33% and rose to 94.9% in the final group, marking a 31.6% increase. In the third section, scores started at 76.5% and reached 95% by the end of the study, reflecting an 18.5% increase. Overall, the initial average score of 71.7% rose to 96.3%, an average increase of 24.6%.
The trend depicted in Figure 1 focuses on clinical evaluation and surgical planning. Initially, the scores notably surpassed half the minimum score required, indicating a strong start in understanding and execution. However, an early negative dip was observed in evaluations of the first five traumas, suggesting an adjustment period for the trainees. This was followed by a stabilisation phase characterised by slight oscillations in performance, which reflected a period of acclimatisation as the residents refined their clinical and planning skills. Progress then continued, ultimately reaching a plateau that approached the maximum score. This progression demonstrated a significant improvement over time as trainees became more proficient in integrating clinical knowledge with practical surgical planning.

Fig. 1 Trend of scores in section 1.
The performance trends in the implementation of surgical planning are illustrated in Figure 2, revealing a distinct trajectory compared with the clinical evaluation observed in Figure 1. Initially, scores in this section were lower, indicating a steeper learning curve as trainees began to apply their surgical skills. A notable initial peak suggested brief early success, but this was quickly followed by a rapid decline as challenges and complexities became evident.

Fig. 2 Trend of scores in section 2.
However, as the evaluation period progressed, the scores gradually improved. This slow but steady ascent reflected the trainees’ increasing proficiency and adjustment to the demands of the surgical skills required. The scores eventually reached a plateau, signifying the stabilisation of skills and knowledge. Notably, the maximum score was achieved after evaluating half the cases, illustrating a significant advancement from initial struggles to proficient performance.
The trajectory of scores in the final evaluation phase is demonstrated in Figure 3, displaying patterns similar to those in Figure 2. Initially, the scores in this section were lower than those in the clinical section, indicating a more challenging start as trainees tackled comprehensive assessments that involved both clinical and surgical aspects. The initial positive peak in the graph suggested early successes, possibly due to the initial application of learned skills. However, this was followed by a gradual decline, reflecting the complexities and integration challenges of the final stages of training. Subsequent progress remained steady, with scores eventually reaching a plateau that signified the stabilisation of skills. Notably, this plateau was reached after half of the cases had been assessed, with trainees achieving the maximum score.

Fig. 3 Trend of scores in section 3.
Unlike the previous sections, wider score ranges were observed in the plateau phase, highlighting a greater variability in individual performance during the final evaluation. This variation could be attributed to different levels of mastery of the integrative and comprehensive aspects of the training by each resident.
The cumulative results from all the evaluated sections of the study are presented in Figure 4, showcasing the overarching trends in skills and knowledge development among the trainees. The graph effectively encapsulates progressive improvements across the entire training programme, from clinical evaluation to final assessment.

Fig. 4 Trend of total scores.
The data in Figure 4 clearly demonstrate a general upward trend in the trainees’ performance, with initial lower scores gradually rising to reach and be sustained at high levels. This visual representation underscores a significant enhancement in both the practical application of surgical techniques and theoretical understanding.
Overall, the results illustrate the robust training methodology employed and the successful acquisition of critical competencies by the trainees, validating the efficacy of the assessment tools used.
Feedback from the trainees based on three key questions resulted in the following responses.
I found the test easy to understand and complete
In total, 57.1% agreed and 42.9% strongly agreed.
I found the test useful for measuring my skills
All the responses were strongly agree.
I found the test useful for improving my skills
In total, 71.4% strongly agreed, while 28.6% agreed.
The feedback provides insight into the test's effectiveness and its acceptance by the trainees.
Discussion
Surgical training within medical specialty schools, particularly in the field of maxillofacial surgery, has not, to our knowledge, been extensively explored in the scientific literature. Typically, such training involves two concurrent educational aspects: clinical and surgical skills. These are intended to complement each other, but they often progress independently. Clinical skills are usually acquired more quickly while manual surgical skills require a longer time to develop, necessitating a blend of theoretical knowledge and hands-on surgical practice.
A national survey conducted in 2009 revealed that 27.5% of doctors undergoing specialist training expressed concerns about not achieving sufficient autonomy by the end of their studies.1,5,6
Unlike previous studies, this research not only evaluated the surgical component but also the clinical aspect, aiming to identify a tool that could assess progress in both clinical and surgical learning.1,2,6,7
Drawing from the scientific literature, we have delineated a unique learning curve specifically tailored for residents in surgical training. This curve differs from conventional ones designed for seasoned practitioners, which evaluate innovative surgical techniques, and is characterised by distinct phases that reflect the residents' evolving proficiency and understanding.
The initial phase in which residents show a lack of awareness about surgical procedures and limited theoretical knowledge, is marked by a steep learning curve as they begin to understand the fundamentals of surgical practice. The second phase involves a positive peak when residents gain a minimum level of unconscious competence and feel more confident in their abilities, although this confidence may not always align with actual proficiency. The third phase has a noticeable shift in awareness as theoretical knowledge begins to surpass practical skills. This leads to residents becoming more aware of their technical limitations, prompting introspection and self-assessment.8
Subsequent phases of the learning curve follow a classic trajectory, leading to incremental improvements in both theoretical understanding and surgical proficiency. By recognising these phases educators and mentors can effectively tailor training programmes to support residents through their learning journey, fostering growth and competency in surgical practice.
The evaluation and self-assessment test in this study aims first to identify clinical gaps, then to rectify them and progress to phases such as surgical planning and execution. The study provides a comprehensive view of the clinical cases, enabling the trainee to personally evaluate their progress.
Analysis of the preliminary study data has shown that initial scores already exceeded half the minimum score, indicating a strong foundation, most likely due to prior theoretical knowledge. However, an initial dip in performance was noted in the first five cases, followed by a stabilisation phase with slight fluctuations. This pattern was mirrored across other sections, with each displaying unique trajectories and challenges, underscoring the complexities and nuances inherent in the journey towards surgical proficiency.
Numerous methods have been described in the literature to evaluate the progression of doctors in specialist training. A classic example can be defined by procedure-based assessment (PBA) whose training role in terms of surgical progression is certainly well established. However, the need to perform a minimum number of PBAs to achieve the right surgical experience is, in some cases, counterproductive.9
The authors found greater effectiveness in an evaluation using Miller's pyramid, which better integrates theoretical skills with application in surgical practice.10 For this reason, development of the test examined earlier in this study was based on the evaluation of theoretical, surgical, and personal skills, divided into distinct sections. Traumatology was selected as the focal point for this preliminary study due to its significance in maxillofacial surgery training. Mastery of traumatology is deemed crucial for expediting the training process for specialists.11
The study's strength lies in its integration of both theoretical and practical components. The self-assessment aspect encourages self-criticism and gap identification, supported by tutor evaluations and numerical scoring, which simplify the assessment of progress.
Feedback from the study was overwhelmingly positive, with high agreement on ease of execution, comprehensibility, and usefulness of the test to evaluate and advance skills. The findings encourage further research to validate the method.
However, the preliminary nature of the study limits the ability to conduct extensive case studies for official validation. If this evaluation method is to become accessible to more trainees, future studies will be essential, and may extend the test to other surgical specialisation schools, potentially applying it to all medical specialisation schools.
This evaluation and self-assessment test serves as a valuable tool for learning progression among trainees, effectively assessing both theoretical and clinical progression while highlighting surgical advancement. It nurtures self-criticism, problem-solving, and personal growth, and enhances individual strengths while identifying areas that require further study. It also allows tutors to gauge their teaching efficacy and adapt their methods to optimise learning.
Conclusion
This preliminary case series study has validated an evaluation system aimed at enhancing the clinical and surgical skills of doctors undergoing specialist training.

Head and neck cancer (HNC) disproportionately impacts deprived patients in the UK. Alcohol and tobacco are significant environmental risk factors, and their consumption and abuse are more prevalent in socioeconomically deprived populations.1 However, socioeconomically deprived patients still have an increased incidence of HNC when adjusting for these factors.2,3 Furthermore, socioeconomically deprived patients are more likely to have a delayed presentation.4
The patient’s commute to hospital can influence their access to diagnostic and treatment services. The distance and travel time must be considered throughout the patient’s cancer journey.5 This has greater significance for more socioeconomically deprived patients who have less disposable income for travel in public or private transport.6
Software can be used to predict patients’ commutes to hospital. This holds significant potential for improving healfthcare services. GoogleMaps online software can determine the optimal route for ground-based emergency services in paramedic transport and retrieval.7 It can also identify the burden of commuting for patients with breast cancer in the USA.8
This software can calculate commutes for patients travelling to multiple hospitals and community-based services, whilst incorporating real-world roads and traffic congestion. It can be adapted to calculate accurate commutes for large volumes of patients. This information can then inform real-world service planning to improve patients’ access to healthcare.
Objectives
This study explores a new method using GoogleMaps to plan services for HNC patients. We have created a model of community-based services running alongside our tertiary centre, and compared this to current practice, where patients are only seen at our tertiary centre. We demonstrate how this model can inform service planning and quantify significant improvements to patient commutes.
Material and methods
Design, setting, and participants
A retrospective review was conducted for patients diagnosed with HNC between 01/12/2019 and 06/01/2022. Patients were identified from a bespoke prospectively collected database registered with our trust’s clinical governance department. This records all patients treated by our tertiary centre’s head and neck cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT). Data were extracted, including patient demographics and postcode information.
We wrote custom Python scripts to analyse patients’ commute times. These scripts required the additional libraries ‘Openpyxl’ and ‘Requests’ which allow Python to interact with Microsoft Excel documents and the internet respectively. They utilised GoogleMaps’ Geocode application programming interface (API), which obtained longitude and latitude data, and GoogleMaps’ Directions API. Directions API is a web-based service which takes a HTTP web address and returns a .JSON file containing directions for travelling between two locations, given in longitude and latitude. These directions follow the most efficient route and incorporate historical traffic data. The Directions API also calculates commutes for a patient taking public transport using bus and train routes and timetables. For each journey, we created two routes, one using private transport and one using public transport.
Using these data, we calculated commutes between patients’ postcodes and our tertiary centre where our MDT is held. Additionally, we calculated commutes between patients’ postcodes and four satellite hospitals, which could be utilised for outreach clinics (A, B, C or D).
Main outcome measures
We identified each patient’s closest hospital and compared that commute to the patient’s commute to our tertiary centre, as is the current practice. Travel distance and time were compared for both journeys in both public and private transport. Additionally, we compared the number of modes of public transport required for commuting in public transport.
We then created a scenario in which only one outreach clinic could run alongside our tertiary centre. Using custom scripts, we matched each patient to either our tertiary centre or the running outreach clinic, depending on which was closest. We calculated the percentage of patients travelling to the outreach clinic and the time savings in both public and private transport for each scenario.
All journeys were set to occur at 09:00 AM on Monday, 7 March 2022, to ensure an accurate representation of traffic for a typical commute.
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using custom Python scripts with the statistical libraries Pandas, Numpy and SciPy. All data were analysed for skewness and kurtosis. All journey and travel data were determined as non-parametric and compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. Mean results are displayed ± standard deviation. A statistical test was considered significant if p < 0.01.
Reporting guideline
We followed the STROBE reporting guideline.
Ethical considerations
Our database is covered by section 251 of the National Health Service Act 2006 to allow use of data for medical research. As data collected were anonymous and observational in nature, ethical review was not required. Our project was registered and approved by our trust’s clinical governance team.
Results
Patient demographics
In total, 748 cancer entries were obtained from 710 unique patients. One patient was excluded as they lived outside of England. The mean (SD) age of patients was 65.7 (13.1) years, 71.7% of patients were male, and 28.3% were female.
Of our tertiary centre and four satellite hospitals, the tertiary centre was closest to 33.7% of patients travelling via private transport and 36% of patients travelling via public transport. Therefore, nearly two thirds of patients are travelling for longer than necessary.
The impact of outreach clinics on a private commute
Our model demonstrates that 55.9% of patients travel less than 20 minutes in private transport to reach our tertiary centre from their home postcode. If we introduced four outreach clinics alongside our tertiary centre, we could increase the proportion of patients travelling less than 20 minutes to 74.5% (Fig. 1, Table 1).

Journey times would be significantly shorter (p < 0.0001) and the average one-way journey time would be reduced by 10 minutes for those travelling to an outreach clinic. Journey distances would also be significantly shorter (p < 0.0001). For those travelling to an outreach clinic, the average private commute would be reduced by 8.2 km for a one-way journey.
A total travel distance of 9035.2 km (a 29.7% reduction) could be saved for one return journey in private transport if each patient travelled to their closest hospital, rather than our tertiary centre. If all patients made a single return journey in a typical petrol car (engine size 1.4 – 2 L), we could avoid emitting 1.67 tonnes of CO2.9
The impact of outreach clinics on a public commute
In public transport, 75.3% of patients travel for longer than 40 minutes to reach our tertiary centre. The population of patients travelling for longer than 40 minutes in public transport would be reduced to 45.5% by introducing four outreach clinics alongside our tertiary centre (Fig. 2, Table 1).

Fig. 2 Patient journey times in public transport.
Patients travelling to an outreach clinic would save 25 minutes on average for a one-way journey. We could therefore save the average patient a 50-minute public transport commute by introducing outreach clinics for a return journey. The average public transport travel distance would be reduced by 9.2 km for a one-way journey. Travel times and distances would also be significantly reduced in public transport (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, respectively).
Our model also demonstrates that introducing outreach clinics would reduce the different modes of public transport required for patient commutes. If all journeys were made in public transport to our tertiary centre, 57.1% of patients would need to take two separate forms of public transport, 11.1% would require three and 1.7% would require four. The introduction of four outreach clinics reduces the number of patients requiring two modes of public transport to 36.5%, three modes to 6.8% and four modes to 0.7% (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3 Percentage of patients per number of public transport transfers required to get to hospital.
One outreach clinic scenario
Results for modelling only one outreach clinic alongside our tertiary centre can be demonstrated in both private (Fig. 4) and public transport (Fig. 5).

Fig. 4 Selecting one outreach clinic from an option of four – data for private transport.

Fig. 5 Selecting one outreach clinic from an option of four – data for public transport.
In private transport, running an additional clinic at clinic A would result in the highest proportion of patients attending that clinic, but it offers a low travel time reduction of 3.7 ± 3.5 minutes. Comparatively, clinic B offers a saving of 22.2 ± 11.5 minutes, however this is non-significant and would only affect 9.9% of patients. In public transport, an additional clinic at clinic D provides a significant travel time reduction of 20.3 ± 14.1 minutes. Furthermore, 38.7% of patients would travel to this clinic.
Discussion
Prolonged and expensive commutes represent a significant burden for both HNC patients and their relatives.10 They also place a greater financial burden on more socioeconomically deprived patients, who have a higher incidence of HNC.3,11 It is imperative to improve access to cancer care by optimising the location of outreach clinics to limit the burden of patient travel.
We have modelled introducing four outreach clinics alongside the service offered at our tertiary centre, which significantly reduces travel times and distances in both public and private transport. Hub and spoke models are not new in cancer care, however our methodology allows healthcare providers to objectively calculate patient commutes in both public and private transport and use these data to plan and develop services.
Our methodology allows the best clinic site to be selected from multiple options to minimise patient commuting. In our ‘one outreach clinic’ scenario, the results suggest that clinic D would be the best of the four proposed sites. It would be closest to 38.7% of patients accessing it through public transport and result in a significant time saving of 20.3 minutes. In private transport, it also significantly reduces travel time by eight minutes for 29.2% of patients. Our efficient and cost-effective methodology should help inform the best location of a new service.
Cancer treatment and follow-up requires multiple hospital visits to achieve optimal care. Regarding surveillance, appointments are recommended every 1–3 months for the first year, 3–4 months for the second and third year, six months for the fourth and fifth year and then annually following this.12 For surveillance alone, 24 appointments could be required over five years. This does not include the multitude of ancillary appointments post-treatment, including speech and language, dieticians, and surveillance imaging.13
Commuting for these appointments represents a significant burden, and our methodology allows times and distances to be easily quantified. Our methodology could be adapted to predict the financial burden of patient commutes, by providing data on patient commuting distances to online calculators to identify fuel costs.14 Quantifying costs in public transport is more difficult, however our methodology identifies each mode of public transport that a patient would use for their commute. With assistance from local public transport services, the cost of each journey would be obtainable.
Our methodology can also estimate savings in CO2 emissions. Approximately 5% of total NHS emissions are from patient road travel.15 The report “Delivering a ‘Net Zero’ National Health Service provides a comprehensive plan for reducing CO2 emissions in the NHS, including a dedicated section on Travel and Transport. The report does not discuss optimising clinic locations to reduce patient journey distances, and therefore CO2 emissions.16 We could use our methodology to easily calculate this saving, plan outreach services accordingly, and obtain low-hanging reductions in carbon emissions.
When using GoogleMaps, users have a limited number of free requests. Every month, users get $200 of free use. The Geocoding API costs $5 per 1,000 locations and the Directions API costs $10 per 1,000 journeys.17 These free quotas were more than enough for our cohort of 709 patients, however using this on a significantly larger cohort could incur expenses.
Limitations
We used patient postcodes rather than addresses for calculating patient commutes. This will affect the accuracy of journey times and distances as postcodes encompass a larger geographical region than a single address.
Concentrating services at a tertiary centre is of great benefit as complex head and neck patients can meet multidisciplinary healthcare professionals for their wide-ranging needs. Although introducing outreach clinics may improve patient commutes, hosting the MDT at multiple sites within a region would have significant financial implications and may be impractical. Outreach clinics could serve for initial two week wait appointments in the build-up to the MDT. They could also be utilised for the surveillance of lower complexity patients who had early-stage disease, or for patients who have completed their treatment and been discharged by allied healthcare professionals from the MDT. Future work could encompass a questionnaire for patients to assess their preferences for a shorter commute time or a longer commute to discuss their treatment with a wide range of specialists, however, this was beyond the scope of this study.
Conclusion
Our efficient and cost-effective methodology accurately calculates patients’ commutes in both public and private transport. We have applied this to a cohort of HNC patients in the North-east of England to determine the impact of outreach clinics on patient commutes. Incorporating outreach clinics would reduce one-way journey times for patients by an average of 10 minutes in private transport and 25 minutes in public transport. Additionally, journey distances would be reduced by an average of 8.2 km in private transport and 9.2 km in public transport. Furthermore, our methodology can identify the optimum location of an outreach clinic from a range of options.
Furthermore, our methodology can be applied to other specialties and departments within healthcare. Our model is not just restricted to the cohort of patients discussed here; it could be used to improve other services across the NHS. When provided with a cohort of patients and choice of locations for an outreach clinic, our model provides commuting data for each patient to each clinic. This information can then be used to identify the optimum location for outreach clinics. In conclusion, we have developed a novel method that allows providers to scientifically evaluate and plan service locations to minimise patient commuting.

Recognizing that these patients not only have higher disease incidence and delayed presentations but also bear a greater travel burden due to limited financial resources, the study explores the potential of using technology to optimize healthcare service locations.

The project employs a novel methodology that leverages GoogleMaps’ Geocode and Directions APIs, integrated with custom Python scripts and libraries (Openpyxl, Requests, Pandas, Numpy, SciPy), to accurately calculate patient commute times and distances. A retrospective review was conducted on a cohort of 710 HNC patients, using postcode data to estimate travel routes and times for both private and public transport. The analysis compared current practice—where all patients attend a tertiary centre—with alternative scenarios incorporating four satellite outreach clinics.

Results demonstrated that only about one-third of patients naturally had the tertiary centre as their closest facility, with nearly two-thirds incurring unnecessary additional travel. Introducing outreach clinics could significantly reduce patient travel times and distances: in private transport, a reduction of approximately 10 minutes and 8.2 km per one-way journey was observed, while in public transport, savings were even greater—around 25 minutes and 9.2 km per one-way journey. Additionally, the model highlighted a decrease in the number of required public transport transfers.

Ultimately, the study concludes that this efficient, cost-effective methodology can guide service planning to minimize patient commute burdens, reduce environmental impacts through lower CO₂ emissions, and be adapted for broader healthcare service optimization.","This research paper investigates using Google Maps API to optimize the location of outreach clinics for Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) patients in the UK, particularly addressing disparities faced by socioeconomically deprived individuals. The study retrospectively analyzed data from 709 HNC patients in Northeast England, calculating commute times to a tertiary center and four potential satellite clinic locations using both public and private transport. The model demonstrates that introducing four outreach clinics significantly reduces travel times and distances, with potential one-way savings of 10 minutes (private) and 25 minutes (public), and 8.2 km (private) and 9.2 km (public) respectively.

Furthermore, the model identifies the optimal location for a single outreach clinic, suggesting Clinic D based on public transport accessibility and travel time reduction. The authors argue this methodology offers a cost-effective way for healthcare providers to plan services, reduce patient burden, potentially decrease CO2 emissions from patient travel, and improve access to cancer care, particularly for vulnerable populations, although limitations exist regarding reliance on postcodes and overlooking the benefits of centralized multidisciplinary teams. The study concludes that the developed method can be applied to other NHS services.","This research paper explores the use of GoogleMaps to model and optimize patient commutes for head and neck cancer (HNC) care in the UK, focusing on reducing travel burdens for socioeconomically deprived patients.

Patients who underwent third molar extraction were randomised into two groups. IANB was performed using 2% lidocaine in Group 1 and 4% articaine in Group 2. The occurrence of NSD was documented. Patients were visited within 48 hours and one week after the tooth was removed. The type of anaesthetic drug (4% articaine versus 2% lidocaine) was the study?s predictive factor. A total of 2400 patients were studied in two groups (1200 in each group). The mean (range) age of the patients was 28.40 (18?44) years. Five patients (0.41%) in the lidocaine group and seven (0.58%) in the articaine group had NSD after injection (p¬†=¬†0.77). The prevalence of NSD after IANB was no higher in the articaine group than in the lidocaine group.","Introduction
In 1986, neurosensory disturbance (NSD) was classified as paraesthesia, dysaesthesia, anaesthesia, and a sense of discomfort, reducing the quality of life.1 NSD can annoy a patient permanently or transiently, depending on the amount of injury to the nerve, and the recovery time varies.2,3 Although inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) is considered a safe method for pain control in dental procedures,4 local anaesthesia (LA) has been associated with some undesirable local adverse effects such as sensory function impairment, NSD such as paraesthesia or dysaesthesia of the IAN, or even damage to taste sensation in cases of injury to the lingual nerve.5
Articaine, often in a 4% concentration, is a local anaesthetic commonly used in dentistry. It was believed that high-concentration doses had a risk of NSD, especially in mandibular nerve block procedures.6,7 Regarding the potential for neurotoxicity and NSD, studies have suggested that these are generally low when articaine is used properly.8 However, as with any medication, there is a risk of adverse effects, including NSD, mainly when high doses are used or when the injection is administered in proximity to nerves.
While articaine is generally considered safe and effective as a local anaesthetic for dental procedures, some dentists and oral surgeons may choose not to use it, particularly for IANB,9 one reason possibly being concerns about the potential for NSD. As mentioned earlier, there is a low risk of NSD associated with its use, particularly when administered appropriately, but some healthcare providers may prefer to use alternative local anaesthetics to minimise this. The scientific community has an ongoing debate regarding the comparative risks of 4% articaine versus 2% lidocaine regarding nerve damage. While some studies7,10 have suggested a slightly higher risk of NSD with 4% articaine, particularly in the context of IANBs, the evidence is inconclusive.11
The aim of this study therefore was to find out whether there is a difference in the prevalence of NSD between patients who received 2% lidocaine and those who received 4% articaine during IANB procedures. In other words, it aimed to compare the two local anaesthetics and determine whether one was more likely to cause NSD than the other. We hypothesised that the prevalence of NSD would be higher in patients who received 4% articaine than those who received 2% lidocaine. To test this hypothesis, we compared the prevalence of NSD in administering 4% articaine and 2% lidocaine in IANBs.
Material and methods
The authors designed a double-blind, parallel, randomised clinical trial. The sample was derived from the population of patients referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences for extraction of mandibular third molars between 1 September 2019 and 31 December 2022. The study was performed according to the principles of the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki on experimentation involving human subjects. The committee of the medical ethics group of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences approved the research (IR.SBMU.DRC.REC.1399.061). The study was registered in an Iranian clinical trial (IRCT 20221203056693N1). The authors reported the study according to the CONSORT checklist.12 Informed consent was obtained from the patients prior to their inclusion in the study.
Patients eligible for inclusion had an erupted mandibular third molar without proximity to the inferior alveolar canal (IAC) in panoramic views. Patients were excluded if they had previously had mandibular trauma, orthognathic surgery, or NSD due to oral surgery (for example, dental implants). All patients underwent simple dental extraction without a flap. Those who needed surgical tooth removal were removed from the study.
Computer-based block randomisation ensured a balance between the study groups. It involved dividing the patients into blocks containing a fixed number of participants and the randomised treatment allocation within each block. One of the authors (AA) assigned each number to each treatment, changed the label of anaesthetic drugs, replacing them with No. 1 or No. 2 for allocation, and was not included in the clinical procedures for blinding purposes. Surgeons and patients were blinded to the drugs. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 received 2% lidocaine, 1.8 ml (one carpule) for IANB, and Group 2 received 4% articaine, 1.8 ml (one carpule). Additional injection with 4% articaine or 2% lidocaine (0.2 ml) was used to block the long buccal nerve. In both groups, IANB was administered using an indirect approach.
All IANB administrations and surgical procedures were carried out by year 3 or higher oral and maxillofacial surgery residents with adequate experience in oral surgery. A 27-gauge needle, 25 mm long was used. Operators paid attention to having bone contact and aspirated before drug injection. In both groups the process of treatment was the same. If patients had insufficient anaesthesia following the first injection, additional carpules were injected and documented.
Immediately after the administration of anaesthesia, patients were asked if they had experienced a shock-like sensation. They were visited 48 hours and one week after extraction for follow up.
If patients complained of paraesthesia or hypoaesthesia, NSD was assessed using a brush test to detect a true direction on the lip and chin, and a two-point discrimination test (TPD). Patients with NSD were followed up monthly for six months. Outcome assessors were blinded to the treatment at the time of assessment.
Prednisolone (5 mg daily) was administrated for 10 days to patients with NSD.13
Sample size calculation
The sample size was calculated using (Zα/2∫2P(1-P) +Z1-β∫P1(1-P1) P2(1-P2))2/(P1-P2)2. The test value of the difference in complication rate was considered 0% with anticipated complication rates of 0.5% and 0.4% in the two groups,4,14 a level of significance of 5%, power of the test 90%, and an alternative hypothesis (one-tailed) (p1-p2) < 0%. The sample size was estimated at 1200 subjects for each group.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 27 (IBM Corp). Fisher's exact test was used to compare the prevalence of NSD between the two groups and the number of carpules used between patients with and without NSD. Pearson’s chi-squared test was used to compare differences between the two groups regarding the distribution of sex, number of carpules used, and number of patients with shock-like sensations during injection. The independent t-test was applied to assess the mean age between the groups. We considered p values of <0.05 to be statistically significant.
Results
Initially, 3240 patients were assessed for eligibility. After the assessment 2500 met the inclusion criteria and were studied in the two groups. Overall, 100 patients were removed from the trial (24 because of surgical removal of the third molars, and 76 because they did not return for 6 months of follow up (40 and 36 participants in the lidocaine and articaine groups, respectively). A total of 2400 patients were studied in two groups (1200 in each group). The mean (SD) age was 28.40 (6.76) years (range 18–44 years). Table 1 illustrates the detailed characteristics and comparisons between the two groups. The distribution of males and females (p = 0.07), mean age of the patients (p =0.83), and number of injected carpules (p = 0.25), were not statistically different between the two groups.

Ninety-six patients in the lidocaine group and 110 in the articaine group experienced a shock-like sensation during injection of the anaesthetic solution. There was no significant difference between the two groups in this regard (p = 0.31). NSD occurred after injection in five patients in the lidocaine group (0.41%) and seven (0.58%) in the articaine group. Data analysis did not demonstrate any significant difference in the prevalence of NSD between the two groups (p = 0.77).
Of the 12 subjects with NSD, five were male, and seven female. One carpule was used in 10 patients, and two carpules in two.

Discussion
Selecting a safe and efficient anaesthetic drug for local anaesthesia in oral surgery is critical for a successful and comfortable procedure. Commonly used local anaesthetics for oral surgery include lidocaine, mepivacaine, articaine, and prilocaine. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of agent will depend on the patient's specific needs and the procedure.
One of the advantages of articaine over other local anaesthetics is its rapid onset and prolonged duration of action.15 Articaine has been shown to have a higher success rate in achieving anaesthesia of the mandible than other local anaesthetics due to its ability to penetrate bone easily. When injected into the mandible during dental procedures, it diffuses through the bone and provides adequate anaesthesia to the teeth and surrounding tissues.16 This is because it has a unique chemical structure that allows it to penetrate bone easily and reach the nerves that supply sensation to the teeth and mucosa.17 The benzene ring on the right side represents the phenyl group, which gives articaine its aromatic properties. The amino group (NH2) on the left side of the molecule is the site of the amide linkage (CONH) that is common to all amide-type local anaesthetics. The ester linkage (COO) in the middle of the molecule distinguishes articaine from other amide-type local anaesthetics and gives it its ability to penetrate bone more quickly.18
Articaine was believed to be potentially neurotoxic,19 but studies have indicated it is safe.20,21 In our study the prevalence of NSD in both groups was similar, and the occurrence of NSD did not relate to the number of local anaesthetic drugs. Temporarily impaired lingual and inferior alveolar nerve function is relatively rare, with estimates indicating a prevalence ranging from 0.15%–0.54%. This means that out of 1000 people, between 1.5 and 5.4 individuals may experience temporary impairment of these nerves.4 NSD in the mandibular block can be caused by various factors, including direct needle trauma, neurotoxicity of the local anaesthetic, and pressure-induced nerve injury. Direct needle trauma can occur if the needle used for the block damages the lingual or inferior alveolar nerve. This can result in temporary or permanent nerve function impairment and can cause numbness or tingling in the affected area.22 Neurotoxicity of the local anaesthetic can occur if the anaesthetic agent is toxic to the nerves. This can result in temporary or permanent nerve damage and cause symptoms similar to direct needle trauma. Pressure-induced nerve injury can occur if the anaesthetic solution is injected under high pressure, damaging the nerve.23
Harn and Durham suggested that the electric shock sensation resulting from needle contact could be a probable cause of injury.24 The study by Krafft and Hickel found that 856 (7%) of 12,104 patients experienced an electric shock-like sensation during dental injections.25 However, none of them experienced temporary or permanent NSD due to the sensation.
It is important to note that while the electric shock-like sensation can be uncomfortable, it does not necessarily indicate nerve injury or damage. Many patients may experience this sensation without any adverse effects,26 but dental professionals should still take precautions to minimise the risk of nerve injury during injections, as even a small amount of damage to a nerve can result in a temporary or permanent NSD. This may include using the proper injection technique, selecting the appropriate needle size and length, and avoiding injecting the anaesthetic solution under high pressure. Several studies have shown that the neurotoxic effects of local anaesthetics are dose and concentration-dependent,27 with higher doses or concentrations increasing the risk of nerve injury or damage. Local anaesthetics block the transmission of nerve impulses, which can temporarily lose sensation in the affected area. However, at higher doses or concentrations, local anaesthetics can also have toxic effects on the nerves, resulting in a temporary or permanent NSD. In animal studies, high doses of local anaesthetics have been shown to cause nerve degeneration and damage and to impair nerve function.28 In human studies, high concentrations of local anaesthetics have been associated with an increased risk of nerve injury or damage, particularly in the mandibular area. Many authors have studied the mechanism of neurotoxicity of local anaesthetics, but the mechanism of local anaesthetic-induced neurotoxicity is still unclear.29
The main limitation of this study is the potential for the occurrence of NSD to depend on the surgeon's experience and skill. In the present study all surgeons were relatively experienced in applying local anaesthetics and in tooth extractions, but the number of NSDs based on the operator’s skill level varies in different studies. Tooth extraction itself can cause NSD in some cases, nevertheless, the authors tried to control this issue by excluding cases that needed surgical removal, as this can be associated with a higher chance of NSD.
Conclusion
Concerning the study's results and limitations, the prevalence of NSD was not higher in those who received articaine for IANB than in those who received lidocaine.

The committee of the medical ethics group of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences has approved the research (IR.SBMU.DRC.REC.1399.061). The study was registered in an Iranian clinical trial (IRCT 20221203056693N1). Patient consent obtained.","The research project aimed to compare the prevalence of neurosensory disturbance (NSD) following inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) procedures using 2% lidocaine versus 4% articaine during mandibular third molar extractions. NSD, which includes paraesthesia, dysaesthesia, or anaesthesia, can reduce quality of life, and concerns have been raised regarding articaine’s potential neurotoxicity when used in high concentrations.

This double-blind, parallel, randomised clinical trial was conducted at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences between September 2019 and December 2022. A total of 2400 patients meeting strict inclusion criteria (erupted mandibular third molars without proximity to the inferior alveolar canal) were evenly divided into two groups. Group 1 received 2% lidocaine and Group 2 4% articaine for IANB, with both groups also receiving a long buccal nerve block. Procedures were performed by experienced residents, and patients were evaluated immediately, 48 hours, one week, and monthly for six months post-extraction.

Statistical analysis using Fisher’s exact test and chi-squared tests showed no significant difference in NSD prevalence between the groups (0.41% for lidocaine vs 0.58% for articaine; p=0.77). The study concluded that, when properly administered, 4% articaine does not increase the risk of NSD compared to 2% lidocaine. Limitations include potential variability due to operator experience, though surgical complications were minimized by excluding cases requiring complex extractions. These findings support the safe use of both agents in dental procedures. Overall, the trial’s robust design and comprehensive follow-up underscore the reliability of its conclusions, providing valuable guidance for optimal clinical decision-making in local anaesthesia selection worldwide.","This double-blind, randomized clinical trial investigated whether 4% articaine leads to a higher prevalence of neurosensory disturbance (NSD) compared to 2% lidocaine during inferior alveolar nerve blocks (IANB) for mandibular third molar extractions. 2400 patients were randomly assigned to receive either articaine or lidocaine. NSD, assessed through brush and two-point discrimination tests, was monitored at 48 hours, one week, and monthly for six months.

The study found no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of NSD between the two groups (0.41% for lidocaine vs. 0.58% for articaine). Sensations of shock during injection and patient demographics were also similar between the groups. All NSD cases resolved within four months with prednisolone treatment.

The authors conclude that, within the study's parameters, articaine does not exhibit a higher risk of NSD compared to lidocaine in IANB procedures. However, limitations include potential surgeon experience influencing NSD occurrence and excluding surgical removals that can also affect NSD prevalence.","This research paper investigates the prevalence of neurosensory disturbance (NSD) following inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) using 2% lidocaine and 4% articaine in dental procedures. The study, a double-blind, randomized clinical trial, involved 2400 patients undergoing mandibular third molar extractions at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. Patients were divided into two groups: one receiving 2% lidocaine and the other 4% articaine for IANB. The primary outcome was the occurrence of NSD, assessed through follow-ups at 48 hours, one week, and monthly for six months.

Results showed no significant difference in NSD prevalence between the two groups, with 0.41% of lidocaine patients and 0.58% of articaine patients experiencing NSD. Shock-like sensations during injection were reported by 8% of lidocaine patients and 9.16% of articaine patients, but these did not correlate with NSD. All NSD cases resolved within four months. The study concluded that 4% articaine does not pose a higher risk of NSD compared to 2% lidocaine in IANB procedures.

The findings suggest that both anaesthetics are safe for IANB, with articaine offering advantages such as rapid onset and effective bone penetration. The study highlights the importance of proper injection techniques to minimize nerve injury risks. Limitations include potential variability based on surgeon experience and the exclusion of surgical extractions.

It was Luhr’s work with compression plates in 1968 that opened the door to maxillofacial skeletal osteosynthesis.1 Since then, advancements in materials and surgical techniques have opened new horizons for the repair of facial trauma. The Groningen consensus in 1999 established the role for open treatment of condylar fractures, but even then it was argued that open management of intracapsular fractures was experimental.2
Although earlier work introduced the open treatment of intracapsular fractures,3 there remains significant debate about the best way to manage these injuries.4 In the authors’ experience closed management remains the status quo for most surgeons. Whilst there is a plethora of classifications, these are often complex and can be difficult to tie into treatment decisions.5,6
Previous studies have demonstrated the advantages of open reduction and internal fixation. This has been through improvements in mouth opening or surrogate markers such as postoperative radiological reduction outcomes.3,7 However, we know of few studies that have outlined combined clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes.
There are significant challenges in the open treatment of intracapsular fractures. Firstly, decision-making is complex and nuanced. Which fractures should we open? How should we fix them (lag screws, positional screws or miniplates)? How should the disc be managed (to plicate or not to plicate)? Furthermore, the advent of total temporomandibular joint (TMJ) replacement has opened further avenues of treatment. In the spirit of these advances, the authors' view on the repair of diacapitular fractures is that the joint must be considered as a whole entity, with not only bony repair, but disc integrity and muscular attachments being considered.
If we wish to pursue this treatmentmodality then how are we to implement it? Whilst surgical access through a preauricular approach is well described (together with practices in craniofacial, parotid, and of course, TMJ surgery), lag screw fixation is challenging and not taught routinely during higher surgical training. Indeed, it is not a requirement for a certificate of completion of training.
Our paper aims to outline a single surgeon’s experience during a three-year period of implementing a practice of open treatment of intracapsular fractures, illustrating the value of mentoring from a senior colleague, and providing a safe and robust governance strategy to ensure satisfactory outcomes.
This study aims to address the following questions:
1.        
What are the functional and radiological outcomes and associated morbidity in this case series of open treatment?
2.        
How do we classify intracapsular condylar fractures to aid decision-making and surgical approaches?
Material and methods
A retrospective study was conducted to determine outcomes following open management of intracapsular fractures. The study was conducted between 2020 and 2023 at a large tertiary maxillofacial trauma centre serving a population of over 2.6 million people. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon (NB).
Patient records were screened to identify those seen and surgically treated for intracapsular condylar fractures. We defined condylar head fractures according to the AO craniomaxillofacial (AOCMF) definition:8 any fracture that runs above a line perpendicular to the posterior ramus below the lateral pole. The inclusion criteria related to all intracapsular fractures operatively managed through an open approach with fixation. No exclusion criteria were included. Information retrieved from the records included demographic data, details of the injury, date of injury and final follow up; also course of symptoms, including pain (yes/no), maximum interincisal mouth opening (in mm), presence of pain, presence of a self-reported malocclusion, House-Brackmann facial nerve palsy score, preoperative and postoperative computed tomographic (CT) imaging; and postoperative patient-reported outcomes, including the Patient Global Impression of Change and the jaw function limitation scale (8-item),9 and overall satisfaction with provided services at final follow up. Patient satisfaction scores were recorded at final follow up using the Patient Global Impression of Change, a short questionnaire intended to be used as an interpretable assessment of how our patients evaluated a change in their status (Supplemental Table 1). Originally designed by Farrar et al in 2001, it evaluates status change over seven incremental scores ranging from ‘very much improved’ (1) to ‘very much worse’ (7).10 Overall satisfaction with services was measured on a five-point Likert scale using emojis, where 0 indicates ‘very unsatisfied’ and 5 ‘very satisfied’.
Treatment was determined using our institution’s flowchart for condylar head fractures (Fig. 1, Table 1). The standardised surgical technique consisted of an extended preauricular, retrotragal approach to the TMJ. The fixation method was two positional KLS Martin 1.5 mm screws via the lateral pole to medial pole. Screw length varied and was determined by scrutiny of preoperative CT scans (Supplemental Figs. 1–4). Intermaxillary fixation was not used perioperatively, and early mobilisation of the joint was encouraged. Patients were given instructions for physiotherapy and adjuncts such as a Therabite™ device to improve mouth opening on a case-by-case basis. Patients underwent postoperative CT imaging routinely and were invited for clinical follow up at regular intervals (one week, and three, six, and 12 months).

Analysis of anatomical reduction was graded from one to three based on the routinely performed postoperative CT images, one being inadequate, two being satisfactory, and three anatomical (Supplemental Table 1). This was judged by both authors (HM and NB) and concordance was obtained.
Since the study was a longitudinal, retrospective case-note review that assessed data, results, and notes from routine investigations, and pre-existing medical records, ethical review was not considered necessary. All data were anonymised before analysis. Descriptive statistics were applied and a linear and polynomial regression analysis was conducted to investigate the relation between time since surgery (measured in months) and mouth opening (in mm), utilising mean squared error (MSE) and R2 values as metrics for model performance assessment. The statistical software used was Exploratory (www.exploratory.io).
Results
From 2020 to 2023, 45 patients were treated for 50 intracapsular fractures (5 bilateral injuries). The mean (range) age was 33 (17–81) years and the male to female ratio 2:1. The mean (range) follow up was 6 (1–30) months.
Mean (range) mouth opening postoperatively was 32 (15–40) mm. Non-linear regression analysis revealed the best fit (R2 = 0.38 for the linear model versus R2 = 0.46 for the polynomial LOESS model) and showed a statistically significant increase in mouth opening over time (intercept = 0.43 mm, R2 = 0.38, RMSE = 7.05; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2).

Six of the 50 patients (12%) presented with a self-reported persistent malocclusion. Of these, however, two patients had concurrent maxillary or dentoalveolar injuries which may have been a confounding factor. In all cases the malocclusion was not objectified and no patient was referred for orthodontic or orthognathic treatment. Seventeen (34%) patients underwent disc plication.
Only 4.1% of patients reported chronic pain during normal activity or function. Temporary facial nerve injury rate was 29% at one week postoperatively. There was a mean (range) recovery time of 4 (2–9) months, and no cases of permanent facial nerve paralysis.
Other complications included one patient with Frey syndrome, managed with botulinum toxin. Four patients required hardware removal, and three patients developed condylar resorption, three of whom underwent (or were planned for) TMJ replacement later. This resulted in 16% requiring re-intervention.
None of our radiological outcomes were graded as unsatisfactory. Twelve outcomes were rated as satisfactory and 36 as anatomical. Patient-reported outcomes completed by 17 patients (38%) indicated high satisfaction rates with the provided services. Of the respondents, all indicated that they had no functional limitations of the jaw, and most patients had the impression that their surgery had improved their general state of health (Table 2, Fig. 3).

Discussion
The accepted view that intracapsular fractures should be treated with either closed or conservative management has been challenged by a growing evidence of improved functional outcomes with open treatment.7 These studies have suggested that it is possible to reduce and fix these fractures with minimal morbidity and good mouth opening and occlusion.3,4,7
There are, however, several significant challenges in the open treatment of intracapsular condylar fractures. The operation itself is technically challenging and the possible morbidity from complications can be significant. There is clinical equipoise around the management of the disc. Furthermore, decision-making around the approach to these cases can be difficult and is compounded by their relative rarity.
Maclennan found that intracapsular fractures were the smallest cohort of mandibular fractures, just 12%.8 Most surgeons do not have the exposure to open treatment of intracapsular fractures, or the regular experience to gain confidence in open treatment of these injuries.
This paper demonstrates a single surgeon’s outcomes after the first 50 open cases of intracapsular fractures and suggests that good functional outcomes can be achieved with open management during an appropriately mentored, supervised, and governed learning curve. Within our cohort, patients had a mean mouth opening of 32 mm and a low rate of malocclusion and chronic postoperative pain (14.6% and 12.1%, respectively). The average mouth opening may be deemed to be reduced, however, our regression analysis has shown that mouth opening tends to increase gradually over time. Extended follow-up periods with this cohort should further substantiate this observation.
Although the rate of temporary facial nerve injury was high at 29%, it resolved in all cases, with an average recovery time of four months. This rate of temporary deficit is higher than that reported in previous work by Neff et al, who noted a temporary deficit in 3.6% of cases.6 However, it is important to note that the authors of that study employed a retro-auricular approach and did not specify their method of grading facial nerve function. In a recent randomised controlled study, Yadav et al observed temporary weakness in four of nine cases treated with open reduction, which aligns more closely with the results of our research.11 In the current study, all grades of weakness (House-Brackmann score > 1) were considered, which might explain the increased frequency. Since no permanent weakness was recorded in this study, we hypothesise that all occurrences of palsy were related to the intraoperative use of local anesthetics, retraction, and postoperative soft tissue swelling.
Other complications that should be considered relate to the failure rate from condylar resorption or the requirement of hardware removal due to concerns about screw position affecting the articular surface of the joint. A total of 16% of patients required further procedures because of this. We know that each time a joint is opened there are additional risks to the nerve, and TMJ function may be further compromised.12 However, others routinely remove metalwork after three to six months with the premise that intracapsular foreign material will interfere with short-term and long-term function.13
Intracapsular fractures involve not just hard tissue, but soft tissues as well. The disc is deemed vital for function and we know of little evidence for the management of the disc in these types of injuries. Our strategy has been to plicate the disc in cases of disc malposition (biconcave disc no longer articulating with condylar head and fossa). This is determined intraoperatively and was evident in 35.4% of our cases. These cases were largely those in which the fracture had occurred at the level of the capsule causing displacement of the head with the disc. Further work in identifying the disc in MR imaging, and long-term joint function is essential to understand the efficacy and outcome of this practice. Furthermore, there is debate about the role of disc position and plication in long-term joint function and health.14
Numerous classifications have been proposed to categorise intracapsular fractures, yet many have been criticised for their complexity and lack of decision-making utility. Loukata et al initially recognised radiological evidence of ramus shortening as a key indicator for open treatment of these fractures.15 We concur that this is a crucial criterion for the open approach, delineating our Type 1 (maintained height) and Type 2 (height loss) categories. However, the system of Loukata et al failed to account for comminuted fractures unsuitable for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). To address this, we have introduced a Type 3 category, which encompasses fractures in which alloplastic TMJ replacement is considered (Fig. 1, Table 1).
Previous systems neglected the soft tissue elements of the joint, an aspect we have integrated, believing that it influences perioperative care. While long-term data are lacking, we suspect that disc malposition contributes to joint dysfunction and morbidity. Our dataset categorises height-loss fractures based on whether they extend above or below the capsular attachment. This distinction is significant, as our findings show that fractures below the capsular attachment consistently led to anterior disc displacement, necessitating disc plication. If a disc intervention is performed it is scored as D2 in the postoperative notes to allow future comparison. The presented algorithm aims to assist in clinical management and surgical decision-making, and incorporates clinical and radiographical features of the joint's hard and soft tissues.
Our study represents the results of a reflective and philosophical approach based on enhanced longitudinal feedback designed to improve patient safety. Comparing outcomes against a control group is the logical next step, and it is important to consider all factors when potentially predicting outcome. It is hoped that the classification described here will form part of the risk predictive strategy. Since 36% of patients were operated on within the last 12 months, our follow up is limited to a mean of six months. Consequently, this early preliminary study lacks long-term results of joint function.
Despite this, our results suggest that open management of intracapsular fractures can lead to good early function and is achievable by a surgeon trained in chronic TMJ disease, provided they have strong mentoring and dynamic governance. What is yet to be seen is whether any long-term complications (such as ankylosis or arthritis) may develop in this cohort. Further work to be conducted by this department may hopefully elucidate this. Finally, future research in this field should include quality of life (QoL) measures and patient satisfaction. One may reasonably assume that improved function and reduced pain may translate to improvements in QoL, but this should be compared with a control group with closed management.
Conclusions
This paper highlights the first three-year period of a single senior surgeon’s learning curve in the open management of intracapsular fractures in a major trauma centre. We described the demographics and functional and radiological outcomes, and quantified the most significant and common risks. A simple treatment algorithm is suggested which includes both non-operative, closed, and open reduction internal fixation (with or without disc plication) and TMJ replacement. It is certain that open management of intracapsular fractures is still in its infancy and there is considerable reflective learning to focus on longer term results. Furthermore, our experience in chronic degenerative TMJ disease emphasises the importance of case selection given the re-operation rate of these cases.
We hope that these data can inform and guide others in their practice. Further work, including long-term joint function follow up, will be fundamental to better understanding these injuries and their management. Perhaps the time has come to consider a multicentre trial with a control group of closed management. This can only happen if, as a specialty, we focus on supporting like-minded colleagues in high-volume trauma practice to adopt the technique.

Building on historical advances in maxillofacial osteosynthesis since Luhr’s 1968 work, the study addresses ongoing debates regarding the optimal treatment of these complex injuries. Although closed management remains prevalent, the authors explore the potential benefits of an open approach that addresses both bony and soft tissue components of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).

The study retrospectively reviewed cases from 2020 to 2023, including 45 patients (50 fractures, with five bilateral injuries) with a mean age of 33 years and an average follow-up of six months. Intracapsular fractures were defined using the AO craniomaxillofacial criteria, and all patients underwent open reduction internal fixation via an extended preauricular approach using two 1.5 mm positional screws. The surgical protocol avoided intermaxillary fixation, emphasizing early mobilization and physiotherapy.

Outcomes were assessed using clinical, radiological, and patient-reported measures. Functional results showed a mean postoperative mouth opening of 32 mm, with regression analysis indicating gradual improvement over time. Complications included a 29% rate of temporary facial nerve deficits (all resolved) and a 16% re-intervention rate due to issues such as hardware removal and condylar resorption. Radiological evaluations were predominantly anatomical (75% of cases). The study also proposes a new classification system for intracapsular fractures that incorporates fracture morphology and disc management, aiming to guide future surgical decision-making. Overall, the findings suggest that with proper mentoring and governance, open treatment can yield satisfactory early functional outcomes in this challenging patient cohort.","This retrospective study examines a single surgeon's experience implementing open treatment for intracapsular condylar fractures over three years. It addresses the debate surrounding optimal management, traditionally favoring closed treatment, despite evidence suggesting benefits from open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The study evaluates functional (mouth opening, malocclusion, pain) and radiological outcomes in 50 fractures, along with complications and patient-reported satisfaction.

The results demonstrated improved mouth opening over time post-surgery, low rates of persistent malocclusion and chronic pain. Temporary facial nerve injury was relatively high but resolved in all cases. Hardware removal and condylar resorption led to a re-intervention rate of 16%. Most radiological outcomes were satisfactory or anatomical, and patient satisfaction was high. The study proposes a simplified classification system incorporating fracture characteristics and disc involvement to guide treatment decisions. The authors advocate for mentored and supervised learning curves in ORIF. While acknowledging limitations like short follow-up and lack of a control group, the study suggests that open management can achieve good early functional outcomes and merits further investigation, potentially through a multi-center trial comparing it to closed management.","This research paper evaluates the outcomes of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for intracapsular condylar fractures, a treatment approach that challenges the traditional preference for closed management. Conducted at a tertiary maxillofacial trauma centre from 2020 to 2023, the study retrospectively analyzed 45 patients with 50 intracapsular fractures treated by a single surgeon. The surgical approach involved an extended preauricular incision and fixation using two positional screws, with early postoperative mobilization and physiotherapy.

Key findings included a mean postoperative mouth opening of 32 mm, with significant improvement over time, and low rates of malocclusion (12%) and chronic pain (4.1%). Temporary facial nerve palsy occurred in 29% of cases, resolving within an average of four months. Radiological outcomes were satisfactory or anatomical in all cases, with 75% achieving anatomical reduction. However, 16% of patients required re-intervention, including hardware removal or total temporomandibular joint (TMJ) replacement due to condylar resorption.

The study introduces a new classification system for intracapsular fractures, incorporating both bony and soft tissue (disc) considerations, to guide surgical decision-making. The authors emphasize the importance of mentorship and governance in achieving good outcomes during the learning curve for this technically challenging procedure.

While the results demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of open management, the study acknowledges limitations, including a short follow-up period (mean six months) and the need for long-term data on joint function and complications. The authors advocate for further research, including multicentre trials with control groups, to establish the efficacy of open treatment compared to closed management. Overall, the study supports the selective use of ORIF for intracapsular fractures, highlighting improved functional outcomes and patient satisfaction when performed by experienced surgeons.",6,3.6,17.1,,,90,90,10,100,83,85,10,95,88,88,10,100

The temporomandibular joint (TMJ), a critical component in our ability to speak, chew, and yawn, is a specialised synovial joint comprising the mandibular condyle and the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone.1 It is rather troubling that temporomandibular disorders, which substantially impair these essential functions, are rampant, presenting with symptoms such as pain, restricted jaw movements, and masticatory difficulties.2
The complexity of temporomandibular disorders and their profound impact on patients’ quality of life necessitate a re-evaluation and refinement of TMJ arthrocentesis techniques, with an acute focus on needle depth to improve both safety and efficacy. The diagnosis and treatment of these disorders are critical in the formulation of medical intervention and treatment strategies. TMJ arthrocentesis, often trivialised, is actually a straightforward, cost-effective, and efficient minimally-invasive procedure for conditions such as arthralgia, internal derangement, and degenerative joint disease.3,4 However, the efficacy and safety of this procedure hinge on the precise determination of the safe needle penetration depth within the joint capsule, which is a detail often overlooked.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard technique for radiological diagnosis of TMJ diseases.5 MRI is a non-invasive and high-resolution imaging that plays a pivotal role in revealing the detailed anatomical structure of the TMJ and evaluating associated pathologies.
The aim of this study is to determine the optimal needle depth for TMJ arthrocentesis using MRI. Given that the depth can vary significantly among patients due to anatomical differences, this study seeks to provide insights that can help tailor needle depth more accurately to individual patient profiles, improving safety and efficacy in treating temporomandibular disorders, a point that should not be understated.
Material and methods
Ethical approval for this retrospective study was duly obtained from the Ethics Committee of Istanbul Medipol University. The study included 264 TMJ MRIs from 132 white patients, aged between 16 and 68 years, all of whom were scanned at our university hospital. Patients with TMJ ankylosis and pathologies were excluded from the study.
Individuals were segmented into age cohorts as follows: patients of 15–24 years were classified as youths, 25–44 years as young adults, 45–60 years as middle-aged, and those 60 years and older were categorised as elderly.
The MRI methodology employed the Holmlund Helsing line (HHL) to establish needle insertion points. The posterior needle entrance was marked 10 mm anterior to the tragus and 2 mm below the HHL, while the anterior entrance was set 20 mm anterior to the tragus and 10 mm under the HHL (Fig. 1). Measurements were conducted using high-resolution T2-weighted STIR images in the axial plane. This imaging protocol was chosen for its enhanced ability to delineate the hypointense joint capsule and its borders clearly, and to allow for the precise evaluation of joint effusion. On these T2-weighted axial slices, the distance from the skin to both the medial and lateral joint capsules at the specified needle entry points were calculated. This approach yielded four distinct data points: anterior lateral (AL), anterior medial (AM), posterior lateral (PL), and posterior medial (PM), as shown in Figure 2. Additionally, the condylar angle was assessed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of TMJ structure (Fig. 3). For the measurement of condylar angles, MRI images were carefully reoriented and resliced according to the Frankfurt horizontal plane to ensure consistent sagittal plane orientation. Furthermore, for each patient, images were aligned to maintain an equal distance from the tragus to the mid-sagittal plane on each side, facilitating accurate and consistent measurements within individual assessments.

The MRI measurements were conducted by a radiologist specialising in the field. To ensure reliability, a subset of 40 patients was randomly selected for repeat measurements by the same radiologist at a different time. Intra-examiner reliability was confirmed with kappa values for AL (κ = 0.88), AM (κ = 0.85), PL (κ = 0.90), PM (κ = 0.87), and condylar angle (κ = 0.92).
IBM SPSS Statistics 22 software (IBM SPSS Inc) was used for statistical analysis. The Student’s t test was used to compare data between genders and different anatomical sides. ANOVA was carried out to analyse differences between age groups and a correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between the condylar angle and age groups.
Results
The participant pool comprised 91 females and 41 males, ranging in age from 16 to 68 years, with a mean (SD) age of 32.89 (12.64) years. The study identified gender-based differences in measurements, with females demonstrating significantly shorter distances than males across all metrics (p < 0.05). No significant gender difference was noted in the condylar angle (p > 0.05), with details provided in Table 1.

In our data, 79 out of 264 PM measurements (29.9%) and 99 out of 264 AM measurements (37.5%) were below 25 mm. However, the mean (SD) PM measurement for females was 26.6 mm (4.2) mm, and for males, it was 29 mm (5.3) mm. Additionally, the mean (SD) AM measurement for females was 25.6 mm (4.5) mm, and for males, it was 27.2 mm (5.0) mm.
Regarding age-related variations, no statistically significant differences were observed in the measurements or condylar angle across age groups (p > 0.05). A weak inverse correlation between age and condylar angle was noted (p = 0.038, r = −0.128), indicating a tendency for the condylar angle to diminish with age. All measurements positively correlated with one another, as detailed in Table 2.

The analysis of the condylar angles revealed an inverse relationship with both the medial measurements (PM and AM) and PL, with statistical significance. The correlation coefficient of this inverse relationship was particularly higher in the medial measurements (p < 0.001 for PM, r = −0.323; p < 0.001 for AM, r = −0.313; p = 0.010 for PL r = −0.159). The AL distances did not exhibit a statistically significant change in relation to the condylar angle. Additionally, a direct proportional relationship was observed among all measured distances, suggesting consistent anatomical scaling within the TMJ dimensions. Crucially, the data indicate that higher condylar angles are associated with a need for shallower needle depths. Specifically, as the condylar angle increases - reflecting a more pronounced tilt of the mandibular condyle in the axial plane - the required needle depth correspondingly decreases.
Finally, the comparison of measurements between the right and left sides showed no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05), suggesting symmetrical TMJ measurements on both sides.
Discussion
Optimising needle depth in TMJ arthrocentesis is paramount to circumvent iatrogenic complications, such as nerve paralysis due to canula perforation or mechanical damage, a risk highlighted in a case report by Aliyev et al.6 A comprehensive understanding of the optimal needle depth is therefore not just recommended, but essential.
In this study, we used MRI to determine needle depth for TMJ arthrocentesis due to its non-invasive nature and superior soft tissue imaging capabilities, crucial for accurate anatomical assessments.7 While MRI avoids the ionising radiation risks associated with CT scans and provides more detailed structural visualisation than ultrasound, it lacks the real-time procedural feedback available in intraoperative techniques. Nevertheless, MRI was selected for its ability to safely and precisely map TMJ anatomy in a pre-procedural setting, which is vital for minimising risks in clinical applications.8
Şentürk et al proposed a needle insertion depth of approximately 20 mm for TMJ arthrocentesis in their literature review, without considering variations based on entry point or gender.9 Our study identified statistically significant gender differences in measurements but supports the conclusion that a 20 mm depth is generally suitable. Despite identifying these gender differences, the absence of significant age-related changes in our measurements further reinforces the applicability of a 20 mm needle depth across a wide range of patients. This supports the practicality and safety of adopting a 20 mm approach, which simplifies clinical procedures and potentially minimises the risk of iatrogenic complications. Although we observed a weak inverse correlation between age and the condylar angle, it did not alter our previous recommendation concerning the depth of the needle, which demonstrates the efficacy of a uniform approach. In contrast to the deeper insertion depth of about 25 mm suggested by Nitzan and Soni for accessing the upper joint space,10,11 a depth of 20 millimetres may be a safer alternative to ensure that the needle remains within the joint capsule, based on the findings of our study.
Incorporating our findings into clinical practice, the pronounced inverse relationship between condylar angles and required needle depths suggests the need for a tailored approach in TMJ arthrocentesis. Individuals with higher condylar angles may benefit from shallower needle insertion to avoid complications associated with deeper penetration. This supports the idea of adapting needle depth guidelines to better match patient-specific anatomical variations, while further research is encouraged to confirm these findings across diverse populations.
The selective request for MRI in patients with clinical symptoms of temporomandibular disorders led to an intriguing gender disparity in our study, with a significant preponderance of female participants (91 females to 41 males). This gender distribution aligns with the findings of Alrizqi and Aleissa, who reported a higher incidence of temporomandibular disorders in females,12 and is echoed in Shimshak and DeFuria's research, which also showed a female-to-male ratio of 3:1 in temporomandibular disorders, a ratio similar to our study.13
In this study, the analysis did not incorporate the body mass index of the included patients, nor did it account for age-related changes in collagen and connective tissue among elderly individuals. Considering body mass index is particularly important as it can significantly affect anatomical landmarks and, consequently, the needle depth required for safe and effective TMJ arthrocentesis. These factors were not systematically considered in the assessment of variations in the 20 mm depth measurement.
Another limitation of this study is the absence of patient classification based on specific complaints, which has hindered more detailed analysis. Future research should address this by including larger cohorts with diverse complaints to enable broader generalisation of the results. This study offers valuable insights for novice surgeons and trainees, who can benefit from tailored depth guidelines for procedural safety and effectiveness. Experienced practitioners typically rely on palpation and tactile feedback, underscoring the study's relevance for those still mastering the technique.
Conclusion
This study offers vital insights into the anatomical landmarks that are crucial for safely and effectively implementing the double-puncture technique in TMJ arthrocentesis, establishing the practicality of a 20 mm needle depth as a safe and reliable guideline for both needle entry points.

The results revealed that females had significantly shorter measurement distances than males, although the condylar angles did not differ by gender. Age did not significantly affect measurements, but a weak inverse correlation was found between age and condylar angle. Importantly, higher condylar angles were associated with shallower needle depths, supporting the safety of a standard 20 mm needle penetration. This finding challenges some previous recommendations suggesting a 25 mm depth.

Huang2024,Optimising oral cancer reconstruction: a retrospective cohort study on the modified radial forearm free flap technique to eliminate the need for a secondary donor site,"Huang, Weijia; Chen, Victoria; Xie, Zefeng; Rezaei, Azadeh; Liu, Yanming",2024,British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,10.1016/j.bjoms.2023.12.005,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2023.12.005,"The radial forearm free flap (RFFF) is commonly used in the reconstruction of oral cancer patients. Traditional RFFF (TRFFF) techniques, which often require a secondary donor site to repair the forearm defect, may result in a scar extending to the dorsal hand. This can lead to significant functional and aesthetic concerns in the forearm. We designed a modified RFFF (MRFFF) that incorporates a glasses-shaped flap and features deep venous drainage. To evaluate its effectiveness we conducted a retrospective chart review of 105 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma who underwent reconstructive surgery between 2018 and 2022. These patients were treated either with a TRFFF (n = 60) or the newly developed MRFFF (n = 45). Our inclusion criteria, guided by preliminary surgical experience prior to initiating the study, stipulated that single oral defects should be no larger than 6 × 6 cm2, and adjacent double defects no larger than 3 × 6 cm2. Flap size, pedicle length, harvesting duration, and anastomosis during the surgical procedure were compared between the two techniques. Preoperative and postoperative oral function, recurrence, mortality, and dorsal scarring were recorded. One-week, one-month, and six-month postoperative subjective aesthetics assessments, and self-reported postoperative donor hand function, were measured using the Michigan hand questionnaire (MHQ). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of flap size, pedicle length, harvesting time, anastomosis time, postoperative oral function, recurrence, and mortality. However, patients with a MRFFF did not require a second donor graft site and did not have scars extending to the dorsal forearm. They also had significantly improved postoperative aesthetic outcomes (1 week: 70.6%, 1 month: 62.2%) and donor hand function (1 week: 54.6%, 1 month: 40.4%) compared with the TRFFF group (p < 0.001). The MRFFF eliminates the need for secondary donor sites and improves primary donor site outcomes. It is versatile and can be employed for either single or composite oral defects. Through extensive case studies, we have defined its specific scope: it is suitable for single defects measuring no more than 6 × 6 cm2, or for composite defects no larger than 3 × 6 cm2. Furthermore, it does not compromise the functional recovery of the recipient site, and should be widely adopted for all qualifying patients.","Introduction
The rising prevalence of oral and oropharyngeal cancer1–3 has led to an increase in the use of microvascular free flaps for reliable and anatomically accurate orofacial reconstruction.4,5 Since its introduction in the 1980s, the vascularised radial forearm free flap (RFFF) has been used widely to reconstruct orofacial soft tissues following tumour ablation, with flap survival rates between 90% and 98.3%.6–8 However, harvesting the radial artery can lead to hand ischaemia and reduced functionality,9,10 and damage to the sensory branch of the radial nerve can result in diminished grip strength and loss of sensation.11,12 The traditional RFFF (TRFFF) also requires a second donor site, such as the abdomen or thigh, to restore the primary donor site. The TRFFF usually grafts the cephalic vein, which can extend the initial incision into the dorsal forearm and make scars more noticeable.13,14 Despite these donor site morbidities, the TRFFF remains the preferred option for defects of the tongue, palate, and mucosa6,15 due to its consistent vascular anatomy, design flexibility, and versatility.
To minimise the risks associated with donor site injuries, several surgical techniques have been proposed, including primary closure,16–18 full-thickness and split-thickness skin grafts,19,20 dermal substitutes,21 and negative pressure therapy.22 Although studies have shown that these methods can reduce the size of the donor site to some extent, they may not be suitable for all patients, and the use of an artificial dermis often results in significantly higher costs.
To address these concerns, we propose a modified RFFF (MRFFF) technique. This innovative approach incorporates deep venous drainage and a glasses-shaped design, which aims to improve both functional and aesthetic outcomes by eliminating the need for a secondary donor site. By harvesting the deep vena comitans or radial artery instead of the cephalic vein, the incision can be limited to the dorsal hand, making the scar less visible. Additionally, the design of the glasses shape eliminates the need for a second donor site. In 2015, Zhang et al used two rectangular RFFFs to avoid a second donor site in 11 cases.23,24 The objective of the technique is to obtain double skin paddle flaps that are narrower than those gathered using the traditional method. The approach facilitates tension-free closure at the donor site, thereby minimising morbidity and enhancing cosmetic outcomes.25
This study aimed to evaluate the significant postoperative donor site differences between patients who underwent TRFFF and MRFFF techniques for orofacial reconstruction. The outcome measurements included one-week, one-month, and six-month postoperative oral function assessment, as well as aesthetic and functional assessments of the forearm donor site, as measured by subjective scores and the Michigan hand questionnaire (MHQ).
Patients and methods
Inclusion
The charts of 105 patients who underwent RFFF reconstruction for various orofacial defects due to ablation of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in our department between January 2018 and June 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. According to preliminary surgical experience prior to initiating the study, patients should have single oral defects no larger than 6 × 6 cm2, or adjacent double defects no larger than 3 × 6 cm2. Among the 105 patients, 65 and 40 underwent TRFFF and MRFFF reconstruction, respectively. This study conforms to the ethical standards outlined in the present version of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the ethics committees of our hospital.
Surgical process and flap data collection
All patients had preoperative assessments using Doppler ultrasonography and the modified Allen test to evaluate the ulnar artery and vein in the donor forearm, and to confirm adequate collateral flow within the hand. TRFFF reconstruction was completed following the protocol described by Soutar.26 The forearm fascia, radial artery, and cephalic vein or vena comitans of the radial artery were harvested in flap sizes ranging from 3 × 3 cm to 6 × 6 cm.
In the MRFFF group, skin laxity was assessed using a pinch test. Cases with a pinch width of less than 1.5 cm were included in the study, as they achieved primary closure with minimal tension in incisions up to 6 cm wide. The surgical protocol for MRFFF is shown in Figs. 1–3. Following tourniquet inflation, the radial artery and vena comitans were traced on the skin. The double paddle kiss flap was designed to resemble the shape of glasses, with two adjacent semicircular skin paddles, each with dimensions not exceeding 6 × 3 cm. Following tourniquet deflation (Fig. 1), the forearm fascia, radial artery, and vena comitans were harvested (Fig. 2). Prior to transfer, the distal paddle was rotated counterclockwise by 180° and sutured to the proximal paddle along its straight edge, thereby creating a circular, double-width flap measuring up to 6 × 6 cm (Fig. 3). After transfer, the donor site was closed primarily with 4-0 Vicryl (Ethicon) and 5-0 Prolene (Ethicon) sutures. During the surgical process, the flap size, pedicle length, and the time spent on flap harvesting and vein anastomosis were measured and recorded for each patient.

Postoperative hand function outcomes at one week, one month, and six months were documented using the Michigan hand questionnaire (MHQ), which is widely used in the assessment of postoperative hand function in TRFFF donor site outcomes. The MHQ was developed in 1998 by Chung et al.27 to standardise the evaluation of various health state domains experienced by patients with hand disorders.28
Aesthetic assessment of donor site
Two hand surgeons independently evaluated the postoperative aesthetic outcomes at one week, one month, and six months on a scale of 0–10 (0 being unacceptable and 10 being satisfactory for the aesthetic assessment). The final score was calculated by averaging the scores. Figs. and 5 illustrate the typical three-month postoperative outcomes of the TRFFF and MRFFF groups, respectively.

Oral function assessment
Preoperative and postoperative oral function outcomes were assessed at one week, one month, and six months by two surgeons. The following five aspects were assessed: orofacial pain, mouth opening, swallowing, language expression, and masticatory function. Each aspect was scored on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 being unable to function and 10 being functioning well), resulting in a total score of 20.
Statistical analysis
The chi-squared test and Student’s t test were used to compare demographic characteristics between the two groups. Normal distribution testing was conducted, and statistical significance was set at p<0.05. ANOVA was used to compare the postoperative MHQ and aesthetic scores between groups. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 29.0 (IBM Corp).
Results
Demographic characterisation
A total of 105 patients who underwent RFFF for orofacial reconstruction were divided into two groups: 65 patients who underwent TRFFF and 40 who underwent MRFFF. Patient demographics are shown in Supplementary 1. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age (p = 0.66), sex (p = 0.6), comorbidities (p = 0.37), smoking status (p = 0.3), or stage of malignancy (p = 0.07). All included patients completed one-week, one-month, and six-month follow-up evaluations.
Flap characterisation and recipient outcome
No significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of average flap size, pedicle length, harvesting and anastomosis times, and postoperative oral function. The mean pedicle length was significantly shorter in the MRFFF group than in the TRFFF group (p<0.01).
Donor site outcome
Comparison of quantitative hand function and aesthetic outcomes
After the surgical process, scarring rates on the dorsal side of the hand were observed to be 0% in the MRFFF group and 72.31% in the TRFFF group, respectively (Supplementary 2). At one-week and one-month postoperative assessments, patients in the MRFFF group had significantly higher MHQ scores than those in the TRFFF group (p < 0.05). At these postoperative assessments, MRFFF patients also had significantly higher aesthetic scores than TRFFF patients (p < 0.05) (Table 1).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first retrospective cohort analysis to explore the utilisation of the MRFFF featuring deep venous drainage and a ‘kiss flap’ design in oropharyngeal reconstruction. Over a span of five years, we evaluated 105 patients diagnosed with SCC. All patients successfully underwent tumour ablation and subsequent RFFF reconstruction, 65 with the traditional technique and 40 with the novel modified technique described above.
The MRFFF has a distinct advantage over the TRFFF as it provides a thin, pliable, and well-vascularised pedicle, which facilitates reliable and aesthetically pleasing reconstruction of oral and oropharyngeal tissues without the need for a secondary donor site. We conducted this retrospective analysis to quantitatively assess donor site outcomes and determine whether the MRFFF could offer superior functional and aesthetic benefits. Our findings show that, compared with the TRFFF, the MRFFF more quickly restores hand function and improves six-month postoperative aesthetics without compromising oral function.
In addition, harvest of the vena comitans of the radial artery avoided an extended incision on the dorsal hand, and the glasses-shaped design led to better wound closure than that of the rectangular shape presented by Zhang et al.23,24 Without the sharp angles of a rectangle, the gentle curve of the glasses shape is easier to align.
Demographic characterisation showed no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, smoking status, or malignancy stage between the groups, making them comparable at baseline. For the average flap size, no significant difference was observed in harvesting and anastomosis times, and postoperative oral function. Due to the design of the MRFFF (two parallel semicircles on the forearm), the maximum pedicle length is shorter than that of the TRFFF. However, in practice, the length of the MRFFF is sufficient for oral facial vascular reconstruction. This is consistent with the recipient outcomes, which showed no significant difference in postoperative oral function between the TRFFF and MRFFF.
It is crucial to consider the limitations of the study design when interpreting the results. First, only patients who presented for six months’ follow up were included. Additionally, we evaluated postoperative donor site hand function with the widely accepted patient-based MHQ assessment, and two hand surgeons, who used the mean score to determine the aesthetic result, evaluated postoperative donor site aesthetic outcomes. However, to better quantify the results, future studies should incorporate objective methods, as both methods relied on subjective evaluations. Finally, the complexity of the surgery as well as the variability in patient demographics and orofacial involvement contribute to the lack of randomised controlled trials in this field. Therefore, while limited by these parameters, retrospective cohort studies have become the second-best option to provide evidence.
Conclusion
The MRFFF with deep venous drainage and a glasses-shaped design is a reliable technique for orofacial reconstruction in patients with oral cancer. Successful reconstruction was achieved in all 105 (100%) patients included in the study. The technique eliminates the need for a second donor site while significantly improving donor site function and cosmesis. The MRFFF is suitable for single defects measuring no more than 6 × 6 cm2, or double defects no larger than 3 × 6 cm2. Future prospective studies involving follow up are now required to determine the true utility of this procedure, which may represent an improved approach to the treatment of a complex clinical problem.

Traditionally, the radial forearm free flap (TRFFF) has been favored for its consistent vascular anatomy, design flexibility, and versatility in reconstructing soft tissue defects after tumor ablation. However, the TRFFF is associated with significant donor site morbidities such as hand ischemia, sensory nerve damage, reduced grip strength, and conspicuous scarring that may require a secondary donor site.

This study retrospectively evaluated 105 patients with squamous cell carcinoma who underwent orofacial reconstruction between January 2018 and June 2022. Sixty-five patients received the traditional technique while 40 underwent a modified radial forearm free flap (MRFFF) procedure. The innovative MRFFF incorporates deep venous drainage by harvesting the vena comitans of the radial artery and employs a novel “glasses-shaped” double paddle design. This design limits incisions to the dorsal hand, avoids a secondary donor site, and facilitates tension-free primary closure.

Outcome assessments included postoperative hand function measured by the Michigan Hand Questionnaire, aesthetic evaluations by hand surgeons, and oral function tests at one week, one month, and six months. The MRFFF group demonstrated significantly improved early hand function and aesthetic outcomes, with a 0% dorsal hand scarring rate compared to 72.3% in the TRFFF group, while maintaining comparable oral function. Despite a slightly shorter pedicle length, the MRFFF offers a promising alternative that minimizes donor site morbidity and improves cosmetic results. Future prospective studies are recommended to further validate these findings. Results strongly support MRFFF.","This study investigates a modified radial forearm free flap (MRFFF) technique for orofacial reconstruction following oral cancer ablation, aiming to improve donor site outcomes compared to the traditional RFFF (TRFFF). The MRFFF utilizes deep venous drainage and a ""glasses-shaped"" design to avoid a secondary donor site and minimize scarring.

The researchers retrospectively reviewed 105 patients who underwent RFFF reconstruction (65 TRFFF, 40 MRFFF). The study assessed postoperative oral function, hand function (using the Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ)), and aesthetic outcomes at one week, one month, and six months.

Results showed no significant differences in flap size, harvesting/anastomosis times, or postoperative oral function between the groups. However, the MRFFF group demonstrated significantly better hand function and aesthetic scores at early postoperative assessments (1 week and 1 month), and improved aesthetics at 6 months. The MRFFF also eliminated dorsal hand scarring. The study concludes that the MRFFF offers improved donor site outcomes without compromising oral reconstruction, offering a potentially superior approach for suitable patients with single defects no larger than 6x6 cm2, or double defects no larger than 3x6 cm2.","This research paper evaluates the outcomes of a modified radial forearm free flap (MRFFF) technique for orofacial reconstruction in patients with oral cancer, comparing it to the traditional radial forearm free flap (TRFFF). The MRFFF incorporates a glasses-shaped design and deep venous drainage, aiming to eliminate the need for a secondary donor site and improve both functional and aesthetic outcomes. The study retrospectively analyzed 105 patients (65 TRFFF, 40 MRFFF) who underwent reconstruction following squamous cell carcinoma ablation between January 2018 and June 2022.

Key findings revealed that the MRFFF group experienced significantly better hand function and aesthetic outcomes at one-week and one-month postoperative assessments compared to the TRFFF group (p < 0.05). The MRFFF also achieved primary closure without extending the incision to the dorsal hand, reducing scarring. Both techniques showed similar oral function outcomes, with no significant differences in flap size, harvesting time, or anastomosis time. However, the MRFFF had a shorter pedicle length, which did not compromise its effectiveness.

The study highlights the MRFFF as a reliable alternative for orofacial reconstruction, particularly for single defects up to 6 × 6 cm² or adjacent double defects up to 3 × 6 cm². It offers improved donor site aesthetics and function without requiring a second donor site. Limitations include the retrospective design and reliance on subjective assessments. Future prospective studies are recommended to further validate the MRFFF's utility and long-term outcomes. Overall, the MRFFF represents a promising advancement in addressing the complex challenges of oral cancer reconstruction.",17,2.9,15.2,,,88,85,10,95,91,93,5,95,92,95,10,95

This recommendation has not yet happened. Currently, no OMFS controlled places at medical/dental schools are directly linked to OMFS Specialty Training (ST) posts. ?OMFS controlled? in this paper refers to dedicated places on shortened second degree courses to which OMFS specialists/trainers have the key role in selection. Freedom of Information requests were sent to 14 medical schools known to have OMFS ?controlled? second-degree MB places: Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Cardiff, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, London?Kings, London?QMUL, Newcastle, Plymouth and York/Hull. Information was also requested from the London-Kings BDS Dental Programme for Medical Graduates (DPMG). These data were supplemented by information from consultants and trainees with experience of the processes. Replies were received from six medical schools in Birmingham, Cambridge, Glasgow, Liverpool, London-Kings, and London-QMUL, plus the dental school of London - Kings DPMG. These seven programmes provide approximately 30 OMFS controlled places per year. The application ratios, between 5:1 and 29:1, are significantly more competitive than selection to ST1 and ST3 places. There are more OMFS controlled second degree places than presented in this paper which only details universities from whom replies were received. If all students in OMFS controlled second-degree places progressed to ST without loss, there are more than sufficient to fill all available OMFS ST places. Linking OMFS controlled second degree places through to OMFS ST posts would deliver the key PMETB recommendation in a process which would be more competitive than current ST selection. For OMFS trainees whose first degree was medicine, OMFS selected places at shortened dental courses are needed outside London.","Introduction
This paper is designed to address three gaps in knowledge about oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) controlled places for second degree studies i.e. medical/dental school places allocated to OMFS trainees to which OMFS specialists/trainers are the ‘key’ selectors.
The number of OMFS specialty-controlled places and their locations are published to help those stakeholders involved in recruitment and workforce planning to understand this key step in dual-degree OMFS. Contemporaneous information on second degree places is published by the Junior Trainee Group (JTG) of the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS)1.
The application ratios for OMFS ‘controlled’ second-degree places may be a proxy for the attractiveness of the specialty to doctors and dentists. Applying for a second degree is not something which is done lightly.
Information about the process of applying for OMFS controlled places is included to help doctors and dentists who have made the decision to pursue a career in OMFS.
Method
Universities with OMFS specialists/trainers involved in the selection process for second-degree places were contacted and asked for information about their processes using Freedom of Information (FoI) requests. Additional information was collected from OMFS trainees who were students on these courses and from OMFS specialists involved in the selection processes by direct contact.
Results
Responses were received from the medical schools of Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Cardiff, Glasgow, London-Kings, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, London-QMUL and York/Hull2. The BDS DPMG of London-Kings also returned data.
No replies with numerical data were received from the medical schools at Aberdeen, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Plymouth or York/Hull Universities. The nature of the data returned from the other universities made it difficult to create a single comparison table but did provide useful information about total applications and total places. Some universities replied with the text ‘fewer than five’ rather than numbers for some categories of data to avoid breaches in data protection. This made their returns less useful.
Data supplied from universities was combined with information from analysis of second-degree locations of specialty trainees and specialists.3
Birmingham medicine
Average applications per year 40.7, average places filled per year 3.4, application ratio 12:1
Birmingham supplied information (Table 1), which is an exemplar for this purpose. We would encourage those involved in OMFS controlled places to keep a similar summary. That said, there were also OMFS trainees who obtained places to study medicine in Birmingham through the normal UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) process rather than the official OMFS controlled places. These “unofficial” OMFS second degree students will make the attrition rate for those in the official places an under-estimate because OMFS specialists and trainees whose second degree was from Birmingham medical school will include those who secured OMFS controlled places and those whose places were obtained outside this process (Table 1 and Figure 1).

Over the 10 years for which data were supplied, 407 dentists applied for the second-degree places at Birmingham Medical School with an average of 40.7 per year (range 27–67). Of these a total of 110 were offered an interview with an average of 11 interviews per year (range 6–14). A total of 54 places were offered with an average of 5.4 per year, of which 34 students enrolled an average of 3.4 (range 1–5).
Data from current OMFS trainees and consultants
The OMFS team at Birmingham were early to recognise the value for the specialty of OMFS controlled second-degree places. The first OMFS trainees received places at a four-year course in 1985. In 1996 it became a three-year course.
In some individual years all places translated into specialty training places. In others (1995, 2008, 2011) none of those offered places pursued an OMFS career. Over the 30 years Birmingham have been offering places to OMFS trainees, of approximately 144 second-degree OMFS trainees, 64 (44%) entered OMFS specialty training (Fig. 1).

Information from second-degree OMFS trainees
The ‘second-degree’ option is a point of entry for dental graduates directly to year three of the five-year MBChB (A100). Candidates are not expected to have completed the UCAT (University Clinical Aptitude Test). Having completed the membership exam of the Faculty of Dental Surgery (MFDS) is essential.4
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, interviews have been conducted remotely in two parts covering commitment to medicine, audit and research followed by a clinical situation with an adverse outcome.
The West Midlands is a large geographical area which offers adequate opportunities for OMFS work and out of hours emergency dental work.
Cambridge medicine
Applications per year 29, places one, application ratio 7:1
The data returned from Cambridge covered six years 2014–2019. There were 175 applications, 21 places were offered, 17 places accepted of which seven have completed their studies. The mean applications per year were 29 with a mean of 4 places offered per year.
A total of 13 OMFS trainees and consultants obtained their second-degree in medicine from Cambridge, about four every decade since 1980.
Information from second-degree OMFS trainees
The graduate programme has expanded recently. The collegiate system offers support with academic and extracurricular pursuits. Local units provide regular employment, mentorship and discretional study budget from a charitable trust. Students can also teach anatomy and work in local dental practices. Students are eligible for a £5600 per annum Cambridge bursary. There are opportunities to take part in high quality research.
Application involves the Graduate Course in Medicine application form in addition to UCAS and UCAT, but dentists are exempt from the requirement of A level chemistry within seven years.
Glasgow medicine
Applications per year 19, places per year 1–2, application ratio 10:1
The data returned from Glasgow, 2019–2024, were too recent for any graduates to have entered specialty training. They averaged 19 applications per year with six interviews offered for 1–2 places. The FoI said that there were fewer than five places per year offered.
Information from second-degree OMFS trainees
The pathway to the three-year medical degree in Glasgow was overhauled recently. Applications are directly through the University’s website and shortlisted candidates are interviewed by OMFS Surgeons and Medical School faculty. Successful applicant(s) enter Year Three with an intensive and rigorous semester of didactic teaching. During the third and fourth years, students undertake two Student Selected Components (SSC) and two electives. These give plentiful opportunities for clinical, research and academic work with the OMFS team which help with BAOMS bursaries, publications and presentations. Local OMFS units have on-call and other contracted clinical work which can ensure pay is protected on starting foundation training in the Scottish system.
Liverpool medicine – short course for dental graduates A101
Applications per year 22, places filled two, application ratio 11:1
Liverpool University were only able to generate incomplete data shown in Table 2. There have been 179 applications for the eight years for which data is available, a mean of 22.4 applications per year (range 15–32). If similar numbers applied in the two years for which there are no data, there would be approximately 220 applications over 10 years.

Data about candidates interviewed is available for nine years with a total of 71 candidates and an average of 7.9 per year (range 7–14).
Twenty-five places were offered over the 10 years (average 2.5 per year, range 2–3) of whom a total of 22 enrolled (average 2.2 and range 2–3). The reasons for offered places being declined were mostly the acceptance of a second degree place at another university whose location/course was more preferable to the trainee.
Information from second-degree OMFS trainees
Applications are made through UCAS to join second year of the A101 programme, with a supplementary application on Liverpool University’s website.5 There is strong support from the Regional OMFS unit during their second-degree studies.
Applicants require to have passed both parts of the membership dental examinations Membership of the Joint Dental Faculties (MJDF) or Membership of the Faculty of Dental Surgery (MFDS) and one year of OMFS experience. No further admission tests are required. Shortlisted OMFS applicants have a panel interview led by local OMFS surgeons, which may be online with a CV and logbook sent in advance.
Studies are completed in ∼34 months with opportunities for student selected components and electives.
Work is available in various surrounding units in Liverpool, Manchester, and North Wales.

Background to DPMG figures
The DPMG6 started in 2007 as a way for doctors to acquire a dental qualification as part of training in OMFS. This coincided with the Medical Training Application System (MTAS)7,8 which prevented surgeons with ‘too much’ experience in a specialty from applying to train in that specialty. For OMFS, the second-degree ‘resets’ the training clock so many of the initial DPMG students were from this background.
Data from current OMFS trainees and consultants
Table 4 shows DPMG graduates currently in or who have completed OMFS training. At 10 per year, 150 doctors would have completed the DPMG8 programme since 2007 and so the 74 DPMG graduates in OMFS would represent 49% success. The majority of DPMG graduates who have entered OMFS did so from their final year of the programme as they had completed Core Surgical Training and their MRCS prior to entering the programme.

Information from second-degree OMFS trainees
Entry to the three-year DPMG course is competitive via UCAS and consists of a panel interview with both dental and OMFS faculty. There are no entrance exam requirements. Common points of entry are post-FY2 and post-CT2 with MRCS. The introduction of more ST1 posts has made post-FY2 entry more appealing. Students join the dental course in the third year, quickly starting in a simulated clinical environment alongside the undergraduate students. DPMG students are taught a bespoke programme via tutorials as well as being expected to engage in self-motivated learning.

Data from London – QMUL MB programme for OMFS and Oral Medicine (Freedom of Information).
Open table in a new tab
Until very recently, the General Medical Council registered medical degrees from all London medical schools in the same way. This makes it impossible to identify a trainee’s university from the medical register. In collaboration with the QMUL, who compared their list of 32 students entering their programme between 2014 and 2017 against a list of current OMFS Specialty Trainees (STs) it was found that 12 (38%) of the graduates in their dual-degree programme were in Specialty Training posts in OMFS (10) or Oral Medicine (2). Looking year by year the 2014/15 had one of five in OMFS (20%), of 2015/16 4 of 8 (50%), of 2016/17 four of seven (57%), of 2017/18 two of seven (29%), and of 2018/19 one of five (20%). Three trainees from these periods left before completing the course.
Of the 10 OMFS STs, three were appointed in Kent/Surrey/Sussex (2) and London (1) with the remaining seven in East of England (1), Mersey (2), Oxford (1), Wales (2) and Yorkshire (1). This shows QMUL is contributing to OMFS training across the UK. Their selection criteria place a high value on tangible financial support (locum sessions) from the region from which the trainees apply. They also had high participation in the BAOMS Mentoring and Support Programme.9,10
Information from second-degree OMFS trainees
QMUL offers an OMFS three-year course and was founded by Professor Iain Hutchison in 1996. Applications open in Autumn and are outside the usual UCAS process thereby leaving four places on the UCAS application for other medical schools. Details of how to apply can be obtained from smd-direct-entrants@qmul.ac.uk.11 Panel interviews run in Spring. Applicants are required to have MFDS/MJDF, minimum 12 months of OMFS and BAOMS membership. UKCAT (or equivalent) is not required.
Successful applicants join the undergraduate third year after a week induction with a crash course in clinical examination and procedures. The clinical years involve teaching weeks and clinical placements alongside Student Selected Components (SSCs) and an elective in fifth year. There are ample opportunities to work in London and connect with OMFS units. Graduation at St Paul's Cathedral is very memorable!
Discussion
Data on all the OMFS controlled places are not included in this review. Some universities did not return numerical data there are likely to be others of which the authors were not aware. OMFS controlled places are constantly evolving and readers are recommended to join the BAOMS Junior Trainee Group which has up-to-date information1 on second degree studies.
The total numbers of applicants for OMFS controlled places cannot be added together as, in each year, those aiming for OMFS will apply using the four spaces available on their University and College Admission Scheme (UCAS) online application. Direct application to London-QMUL for medicine can be in addition to their UCAS form. These data suggest that there are lots of young dentists and doctors who want to be OMFS surgeons in spite of the current financial and life-style commitments required.12–14 This is consistent with previous questionnaire based surveys.15,16
The OMFS training programmes in the UK require between 25 and 30 trainees per year.17 The exact number each year depends on which points of entry (ST1/ST3) and how many current trainees choose to extend their time in training by working Less Than Full Time or through fellowships or research.18 ST1 posts include 1–2 years of core surgical training and the opportunity to pass the MRCS exam, before they ‘Run-Through’ into OMFS specialty training. OMFS ST3 posts are open to applicants who have either completed core training or can demonstrate readiness to enter specialty training with supporting evidence.19
If a national selection process for entry to OMFS controlled second degree places is to be created lessons should be learnt from the existing OMFS controlled selection processes, particularly the ones which have the lowest ‘drop-out’ rate. There is support from all grades in the specialty19 for selection of OMFS trainees into a Fully Integrated Dual Degree OMFS Specialty Training programme which uses a regional process with national benchmarking.
There are more OMFS controlled places than were available in the last publication on this theme.20 If OMFS controlled could be linked to OMFS Specialty Training (ST) posts, as recommended by PMETB,21 there should be many fewer trainees lost to other specialties.22 Creating these Fully Integrated Dual Degree OMFS Specialty Training programmes (which some call ‘OMFS Run-Through Max’)19,23 is supported by the specialty19,24 and the specialty association25,26 and could reduce the costs in time and money for all those involved.

The study investigates how these dual-degree opportunities are structured and how they influence workforce recruitment into the specialty.

The authors obtained data using Freedom of Information requests to universities involved in the selection process and supplemented this with direct feedback from OMFS trainees and specialists. Respondents included institutions such as Birmingham, Cambridge, Glasgow, Liverpool, London-Kings, and London-QMUL. For example, Birmingham Medical School reported an average of 40.7 applications per year for its OMFS places, with roughly 3.4 students enrolling and an application ratio of approximately 12:1. Comparable competitive figures were noted at other universities, though variations in reporting and data presentation (e.g., “fewer than five” responses) complicated direct comparisons.

Additional insights came from specialized programmes like the Dental Programme for Medical Graduates (DPMG) at London-Kings and OMFS entry courses at London-QMUL, which revealed distinct admission processes and pathways. The research highlights that despite the considerable commitment required, there is substantial interest among young dentists and doctors in pursuing an OMFS career.

In conclusion, the paper recommends that integrating OMFS controlled places with specialty training posts could streamline the progression into OMFS, reduce trainee attrition, and lower financial and time costs. Such fully integrated dual-degree training programmes are supported by both the specialty and its professional bodies, promising improvements in recruitment and workforce planning.","This research paper investigates the application process and success rates for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) ""controlled"" second-degree places (medical/dental school slots specifically for OMFS trainees) in the UK.

Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) is a unique surgical specialty requiring dual qualification in medicine and dentistry. Originating as a dental specialty, there was a move in the 1970’s towards dual qualification due to the increasing severity and complexity in the procedures being performed, culminating on 16 March 1984 with the FRCS(OMFS) examination being ratified by the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the first diet occurring 17–22 January 1985. 1

Since then, there has been increased interest in OMFS by primary medical graduates who gain little exposure in their undergraduate degree but become aware of it in the post graduate workplace. In order to capitalise on this, and through a collaboration between Health Education England (HEE) and Kings College London (KCL) the three-year undergraduate Dental Programme for Medical Graduates (DPMG) was devised, with provisional funding allocated and the first intake commencing in September 2007 2 for the attainment of a Bachelor of Dental Surgery that is fully registerable with the General Dental Council.

The DPMG course involves students completing the second and third years of the undergraduate programme in their first year with subsequent assimilation into the undergraduate fourth year in the DPMG second year. 3 All aspects of the standard undergraduate programme are completed with some rationalised topics that were covered in depth within medical undergraduate training, including anatomy and human disease. Attendance in these modules is exempt to allow participation elsewhere, but all examination commitments are fulfilled. Throughout the first year there are intense tutorials with world-renowned experts, professors, and senior tutors in all aspects of dentistry with ongoing mentorship by all faculty, current students, alumni and OMFS Consultants long after graduation.

Originally, each year consisted of eight DPMG students with up to four additional students placed on the Graduate/Professional Entry Programme (GPEP) to allow back fill of the DPMG course. This, however, was changed with the 2015 intake to include 10 DPMG and two GPEP after agreement with HEE. Students are typically self-funded with the aid of Student Finance maintenance and tuition loans. At the time of inception, the tuition fees were £3000 per academic year, and although this has since risen to £9250, 4 a National Health Service (NHS) Bursary is available from the second year up to £3191 per year. 5 To finance this shortfall it is common for students to do locum work or fellowship roles, which are plentiful in and around London. 4

Material and methods
The data were collated through dissemination of an online questionnaire, direct updates to the authors, a freedom of information (FOI) request to KCL and review of the General Medical Council (GMC) and General Dental Council (GDC) registers and subsequently analysed. Ethics approval for the project was approved through KCL.

Results
Part of the entry descriptions for the DPMG and GPEP pathways, as defined by Kings College London (KCL), is the course is designed for doctors wishing to pursue a career in OMFS, Oral Medicine or Oral Pathology, 3 therefore we include these specialties in the data collection and analysis. Between the graduating years of 2010 and 2023, 137 students started the accelerated pathway of which the authors were able to find the status of 132 (96.4%); four students failed to graduate and were lost to follow up, and one student’s outcome was unverified. Genders, as defined on the GMC register, were collated with an overall male to female ratio of 1.7:1 (M = 87, F = 50). This ratio becomes closer when in higher surgical training at 1.5:1 (M = 50, F = 33), and diverges significantly for those that become General Dental Practitioners, 2.8:1 (M = 17 F = 6).

Further data from the GMC register that included the dates of provisional registration and entry on to the specialist register, combined with the graduation dates, enabled analysis between these time periods. The average number of years between provisional registration and KCL graduation was 6.3 years (range 3-13), provisional registration and entry onto the specialist register was 14.7 years (range 12-19) and between KCL graduation and the specialist register was 7.25 years (range 5-12). A gender divide of one year (M = 14.3 vs F = 15.4 years) is evident in the time between provisional registration and entry onto the specialist register.

In total 70% (n = 95) of alumni are in a dual qualification training or are consultants, however, only one graduate has taken a career into oral medicine and none into pathology. Further breakdown demonstrates 51.6% (n = 49) are within OMFS training at various points ( Fig. 1 ), and of the 158 OMFS trainees 6 KCL students equate to 29% (n = 46) and only one out of 95 students to enter into higher surgical training changed career at this point.

Career Outcomes of Students.
The most common alternative career is dentistry (16.9%, n = 23). Since the first graduating class of 2010 there have been four students (3%) who did not complete the programme, equating to 0.3 students per year. In addition, 3% (n = 4) of students are have left healthcare, which is equal to other dental courses, 3% 7 and lower than in medical courses, 4%. 8 The FOI request sent to KCL, demonstrated in Table 1 , compares the admission and qualifications of each of the individual courses that King’s provides, which allows comparative analysis during the same period, but, unfortunately, breakdown of the graduate entry programme of whom were medical graduates was not available.

Discussion
The DPMG was established to facilitate an organised and accelerated route for primary medically qualified OMFS trainees to gain dual qualification and proceed onto speciality training in OMFS, oral medicine, and oral pathology. This has been successful, with 133 students graduating and 95 (70%) entering a dual qualification specialty, many of whom would likely have not chosen the career pathway without the existence of the programme. The tailored programme allows accelerated learning, bypassing sections previously completed through medical school and concentrating on the additional requirements to become fully registerable dentists. A testament to the course quality is the number of students who have chosen to work in dentistry post-qualification, demonstrating they felt fully enabled and competent to take up the role. While this is essential with the current requirement for dual qualification, it is somewhat unavoidable that a proportion, 16.9% (n = 23), will choose dentistry as a new career path. These alumni would likely have chosen this option regardless of the KCL degree resulting in a registerable dental degree and more of a demonstration of the current situation of working within the NHS. This is in part due to the significant financial advantages of UK dentistry, where the average salary in London is £141 500. 9 The non-financial cost of training has also recently been highlighted by the Association of Surgeons in Training’s report in 2024 10 in which half of trainees were considering practise abroad, 76% reported a negative impact on their physical health, and 84% on their mental health.

To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first publication to analyse the specialty retention of dually qualified medicine-first OMFS trainees and there is no recently published data on dental-first trainees. It is therefore difficult to directly compare the KCL course with other courses for trainees entering the specialty and is an area for further research. Magennis and Ong 11 did present, at the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons Annual Scientific Meeting in 2008, a 10-year follow-up survey of 170 dental graduated students with 61% (93/153) either being OMFS Consultants or trainees. These data are over 16 years old but when compared with the KCL alumni entering a dual qualification pathway we present a higher rate of 70% (n = 95/137), further demonstrating the effectiveness and importance of the programme. One potential for this difference is that it is generally considered that for a medic, the attainment of dentistry only creates dentistry as an alternative career and the applicants are further down the specialisation trajectory. This is in direct contrast to a dentist undertaking medical training, where the entirety of medicine and surgical careers are available following graduation.

While more men enter the KCL programme, comparatively fewer are going into OMFS and a higher proportion become dentists. Fifty of the 137 students were women (36.5%) which is in line with the overall gender difference in the consultant body in 2020, 36% 12 and our data show a small gender difference with time to entry onto the GMC specialist register of one year. This could be multifactorial with an area for further research, but with the average only being one year (range M, 12–17 vs F, 13–19) and women more likely to enter training, further efforts should be made to showcase the career to aspiring female surgeons. The average time between attainment of provisional and specialist registration was 14.7 years (range 12–19), which is longer than the minimum period of 11 years and likely due to attainment of higher research degrees, transfers from other surgical training pathways, part time training, and participation in dental training jobs. This is further demonstrated by the variation between provisional registration and KCL graduation, 6.3 years (range 3–13) and then attainment of specialist registration, 7.25 years (range 5–12). With this age data we can infer the likely average ages of KCL trainees at different points during the training with the average age of provisional registration 24 years old, alumni’s KCL graduation age likely 30.3 years old (range 27–37) and entry onto the specialist list 38.7 years old (range 36–43). This demonstrates the extensive variability in the length of training, but also that the majority will attain specialist registration before 40.

A FOI request to Kings College London was performed to investigate and compare the number of students that complete each of the medicine and dentistry courses, including the three shortened courses for graduate-entry as second degree in OMFS training. This is demonstrated in Table 1 and combined with our data where the 137 students who started dentistry as their second degree, 97% (n = 133) completed the course. An article in the Times newspaper in 2014 13 also demonstrated a 5% drop out rate of medical students across all universities through a similar FOI request. This is higher than the 3% (n = 4) from our cohort and when compared with the other King’s programmes, as well as nationally, our alumni rate is favourable and demonstrates attrition rates that are not specific to second degree therefore should be considered a comparative success.

Our data demonstrate that a high percentage, 48.4% (n = 46/95) of the alumni are on the consultant pathway. This is due to the different stages at which people enrol, ranging from after Foundation Year 2 to the career change of Registrars from other specialties. As a result, it can therefore take a variable amount of time to reach consultancy and the attrition of each stage with all specialties will also apply. This attrition rate for OMFS has been described by Khalil et al 14 as 2.48% over a five-year average. This was slightly lower than the average for all surgical specialties at 2.68% and only applies to those with national training numbers, whereas in our data series to date this only occurred in one case (1.06%, n = 1/95). This demonstrates the importance of the course to the specialty as well as the alumni’s commitment; when graduates enter higher surgical training they almost always compete it and work in OMFS. This is at a better rate than the five-year average for the specialty as well as every other surgical specialty, the next lowest being Neurosurgery at 1.72%. Our data also suggest that with 46 having current OMFS national training numbers, the KCL course contributes to almost 29% of the total 158 national OMFS higher surgical trainee workforce as of 2023, 6 which further demonstrates the essential role the programme has in training OMFS consultants and we would suggest this is likely a stable representation. We also attribute the ongoing success in the students continuing along the pathway to the extensive mentorship and community attributed to the programme. At points where students and alumni can become disenfranchised, this valuable role can encourage and support students reminding them of the reasons they chose the career.

Only one of the alumni has chosen a career, other than OMFS, that is attainable through dual qualification even though it is open to Oral Medicine and Oral Pathology trainees, 3 we propose the reasoning for this is that for a primary medically qualified student, other comparable specialties are available without the need for dual qualification and therefore a more attractive option.

Conclusion
Overall, it should be considered that the KCL course is a successful addition to the OMFS training pathway through enabling over 80 primary medical students to pursue careers within OMFS in an accelerated fashion allowing faster career progression and decreased financial burden. Almost thirty percent of OMFS higher surgical trainees are alumni of the course with lower appreciable attrition rates compared with other routes in all stages of their careers. To additionally appreciate the success in the instigation of the course, further analysis is needed to compare against the percentage of primary dentists and primary medics in other courses and their long-term commitment to the OMFS specialty, which the authors feel would likely be comparable if not lower.

The authors also strongly advocate that the course be expanded to other regions around the United Kingdom, supplying OMFS trainees to low uptake areas while offering increased availability with reduced relocation and living costs. Further efforts also need to be made in streamlining and shortening training in order to continue providing high quality Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons and safeguard the long-term future of the specialty and the public.

","This research project examines the design, implementation, and outcomes of an accelerated dual qualification programme in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) established at King’s College London (KCL). Originally conceived to enable primary medical graduates, who typically have limited dental exposure, to pursue careers in OMFS, Oral Medicine, or Oral Pathology, the programme provides a pathway to obtain a fully registerable Bachelor of Dental Surgery. Initiated in 2007, and later expanded in 2015 to include additional Graduate/Professional Entry Programme (GPEP) students, the curriculum compresses dental education by integrating advanced dental-specific modules with medical training. Intensive tutorials, mentorship from leading experts, and streamlined coursework ensure that participants bypass redundant topics while fulfilling all essential requirements.

Data were collected through online questionnaires, direct communication with authors, Freedom of Information requests, and review of both General Medical Council and General Dental Council registers. Analysis of outcomes from 137 enrolled students (132 verified graduates) revealed a 97% completion rate and a gender distribution with a male predominance. The average duration from provisional registration to KCL graduation was 6.3 years, with specialist registration attained after 14.7 years on average, and a slight gender gap observed in training timelines.

70% of alumni continue in dual qualification training or serve as consultants, significantly contributing 29% of the national OMFS higher surgical trainee workforce. Low attrition rates and high engagement in the specialty underscore the programme’s success. The authors advocate expanding the programme across the United Kingdom to support underserved regions and enhance the long-term sustainability of OMFS training.","This study analyzes the outcomes of the three-year undergraduate Dental Programme for Medical Graduates (DPMG) at King's College London (KCL), designed to accelerate dual qualification for doctors pursuing Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) or related specialties. Researchers tracked 132 of 137 students graduating between 2010 and 2023, examining career paths, gender distribution, and training timelines using questionnaires, KCL data, and professional registers.

The findings reveal that 70% of graduates pursued dual qualification specialties, predominantly OMFS (51.6%), with dentistry as the most common alternative career (16.9%). The program has a 97% completion rate, with 29% of OMFS higher surgical trainees being KCL alumni. There's a gender difference in career choices and training timelines. The study concludes that the DPMG is a successful route for medically qualified individuals to enter OMFS, contributing significantly to the OMFS workforce and showcasing lower attrition rates compared to other surgical specialties. The authors suggest course expansion and training streamlining for a more long-term sustainable specialty.","This research paper evaluates the outcomes of the Dental Programme for Medical Graduates (DPMG) at King’s College London (KCL), an accelerated pathway for primary medical graduates to gain dual qualification in dentistry and pursue careers in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS), Oral Medicine, or Oral Pathology. Established in 2007, the DPMG allows medical graduates to complete a Bachelor of Dental Surgery in three years, integrating them into the fourth year of the undergraduate dental program after the first year of intensive tutorials and mentorship. The program aims to address the dual qualification requirement for OMFS, a specialty that demands expertise in both medicine and dentistry.

The study analyzed data from 137 students who enrolled in the DPMG between 2010 and 2023, with 133 (97%) successfully graduating. Of these, 70% (95 students) entered dual qualification specialties, primarily OMFS, with 51.6% (49 students) currently in OMFS training. The program has contributed significantly to the OMFS workforce, with KCL alumni comprising 29% of the 158 OMFS higher surgical trainees in 2023. The attrition rate for OMFS trainees from the DPMG is exceptionally low (1.06%), compared to the national average of 2.48% for surgical specialties.

The study highlights the program's success in retaining trainees, with only 16.9% (23 students) opting for general dentistry instead of OMFS. The average time from provisional medical registration to specialist registration was 14.7 years, with a slight gender disparity (men: 14.3 years, women: 15.4 years). The authors advocate for expanding the DPMG to other regions to address workforce shortages and reduce relocation costs for trainees.

Overall, the DPMG is a vital pathway for producing OMFS consultants, offering accelerated training and strong mentorship, which contributes to high retention rates and career progression. The authors recommend further research to compare the outcomes of medical-first and dental-first OMFS trainees and suggest streamlining training to ensure the specialty's future sustainability.",26,3.2,27.13,,,95,94,10,100,85,88,15,95,92,96,10,100

There has always been overlap of training and care between both specialties. The OMFS curriculum was updated in 2021 and the Oral Surgery Curriculum in 2023. This paper quantitatively compares the two documents. The generic professional elements of both curricula are extensive and similar in content. The specialty specific elements of the OS and OMFS curricula, with focus on knowledge domains and competencies including index procedures and critical conditions, were compared with the level of coincidence colour coded: green (matching), amber (some overlap) and red (not present). OMFS curriculum contains all components of the new UK OS curriculum with the exception of formal documented competence in conscious sedation for dentistry. This overlap between OMFS and OS has been recognised by the General Dental Council who give OMFS specialists direct access to the Oral Surgery specialist list by Route 4. In contrast, the OS overlap with OMFS is limited, particularly in the important critical/emergency conditions where ?competence? has been replaced by ?experience of? in the 2023 OS curriculum in the domains of trauma and acute infections. This change will preclude OS specialists trained on the new curriculum being able to share on-call with OMFS specialists without significant additional training. We hope this comparison will be useful to those commissioning services and also for young dentists/doctors considering their future careers.","Introduction
The General Medical Council undertook a planned review of all medical curricula between 2017 and 2022 including the OMFS curriculum. The core elements for being a specialist doctor were common across all the curricula. The OMFS curriculum was written by the OMFS Specialty Advisory Committee (OMFS SAC), a sub-committee of the intercollegiate Joint Committee for Surgical Training (JCST) and finalised in 2021. 1 The OMFS curriculum, in common with the curricula of all surgical specialties, also requires trainees to have attained competencies in the UK Core Surgical Training Programme 2 before entry to specialty training. The 2021 OMFS curriculum is integrated into the Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme, the online portfolio with which all UK surgical training is managed, The OMFS curriculum also defines the syllabus/blueprint for the FRCS (OMFS) exit exam and was a key element in the development of the OMFS European Training Requirement (OMFS ETR). 3

In 2017 the General Dental Council started a review of all the dental specialty curricula. Their aim was to modify all dental specialty curricula to follow a similar structure with generic elements common across all specialties. The GDC also asked all dental specialties to focus on the core knowledge and skills required for each dental specialty. The OS curriculum was written by the Oral Surgery Specialty Advisory Committee (OS SAC) which is a sub-committee of the inter-collegiate Joint Committee for Higher Training in Dentistry (JCHST). The OS SAC invited comments and contributions from all stakeholders including the UK Committee of Postgraduate Dental Deans and Directors (COPDEND), the British Association of Oral Surgeons, the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, and the OMFS SAC. There were many iterations of the curriculum until the final version was approved by the GDC on 23 January 2023 4 and published on its website shortly thereafter. The 2023 OS Curriculum is self-contained and does not have extra-curricular requirements or include ‘extended competencies’.

In light of the recently updated specialty curricula, 14 and having previously reviewed the curricula for Foundation/Core OMFS and OS, 56 we sought to quantitatively analyse and compare the new OS and OMFS curricula to establish areas of overlap and difference. The aim was to help all those involved with commissioning OS and OMFS care for patients to understand the similarities and differences between the specialties. It might also help those considering their future careers to ponder their options.

Methods
Both the 2021 OMFS and 2023 OS curricula were examined and deconstructed into their respective domains. The Oral Surgery Curriculum was mapped to the OMFS curriculum and the OMFS curriculum, including the UK Core Surgical Training curriculum, was mapped to the OS curriculum. During the analysis a ‘traffic light’ system Red, Amber, Green’, also called a RAG rating, was used to grade the degree of overlap for each procedure/competence/domain. Green indicated that there was substantial coincidence in that domain/competence, Amber indicating some overlap, and Red indicating an area not covered in corresponding curriculum. 7 Where the raters did not agree on the RAG rating, these were discussed to allocate to an appropriate rating. A consensus was achieved for all domains/competencies after discussion and group review.

Oral Surgery curriculum overlap with OMFS curriculum
Analysis of the OS curriculum identified nine domains with a total of 127 competency-based statements. Comparison with OMFS curriculum showed that 118 (93%) of the competencies were green - having complete overlap - with eight (6%) amber and one (1%) red. Four of the OS domains (44%) were completely matched by OMFS, five (56%) were mostly green with some amber areas, with only one domain recording a red score. These results are summarised in Table 1 .

Table 1
Oral Surgery Critical Conditions and curriculum domains: overlap with OMFS competence.

*Managing life-threatening airway compromise does not include competency in front of neck access.
** Spreading infections does not include independent practice of surgery to the neck e.g. management of necrotising fasciitis.
*** Does not include severe/life threatening haemorrhage e,g, control of neck vessels.
**** Refers to patients who have been referred to oral surgery specialist.
The ‘red’ area not covered in OMFS curriculum was from Domain 4 and related to documented competence in the safe and appropriate delivery of inhalational and conscious sedation as an independent practitioner.

Changing the focus to ‘index procedures’ within the OS curriculum where competency at level 4 (independent practice) is required, there is complete overlap with the OMFS index procedures with the exception of competencies in solo sedation. For OS Index Procedures where ‘experience of’ or ‘simulation’ is the level of competence required, the OMFS curriculum requires competency at Level 4 (independent practice) except implant placement where the same level of competency is required i.e. ‘experience of’ Level 1-2. ( Table 2 ).

Looking at the syllabus of knowledge within the OS curriculum, it is also important to note that there are domains without matching index procedures i.e. where competence at the level of independent practice is not required on completion of training. The most important of these where OS specialists have ‘knowledge of’ rather than ‘competency in’ are: managing life-threatening airway compromise, life-threatening spreading infections, acute sight-threatening orbital trauma/complications, life-threatening haemorrhage and management of the critically ill patient.

OMFS curriculum overlap with oral surgery curriculum
The OMFS curriculum (134 pages) is more than 100 pages longer than the OS curriculum (32 pages) and has a different structure. The General Medical Council required all specialty curricula to be based around generic elements common across all medical specialties. These are Capabilities in Practice (CiPs) and a General Professional Capacities (GPCs). 8 The CiPs and GPCs are the constituent parts of the role of a specialist in OMFS. Each part is as important as the next, and doctors are required to be capable in all elements of the role of specialist surgeon in order to be able to practice independently. Whilst the definitions of GPCs do not exactly map to GDC generic domains, there are sufficient similarities in principle and practice between GPC in the OMFS curriculum and the generic elements (Domains 1-4) of the OS curriculum that these were accepted to be the same by all authors.

In the specialty specific elements of the OMFS curriculum there was full overlap with oral surgery in the 56 elements of the Dentoalveolar Module of the OMFS curriculum including the 24 clinical skills in this Section. There was overlap with the ‘dentoalveolar’ component of the OMFS indicative numbers (green) and some overlap (amber) in management of oral dental infections and soft tissue trauma such as closing lacerations. Outside these there is no other overlap in the OMFS indicative numbers with the OS curriculum. ( Table 3 ).

Table 3
OMFS Indicative Numbers/Competencies overlap with Oral Surgery – Level 4 independent practice except where indicated in blue.

For CiPs there is some overlap in outpatient working but the referrals accepted by oral surgeons will not match those of OMFS because referring dental and medical practitioners may refer differently based on the perceived differences between the specialties. Similarly, the CiP for multi-disciplinary working will have some overlap but there will be differences in the skills and knowledge brought by each specialist. These were marked as Amber because, for the numerical bulk of referrals, there would be expected to be overlap OMFS CiPS and OMFS Critical Conditions are summarised in Table 4 . There is no overlap of OMFS Critical Conditions with the Oral Surgery curriculum.

Discussion
By analysing the competencies and domains required for GDC registration as a specialist in OS alongside those for specialists in OMFS, we have created a broad framework for comparison of the specialties with both qualitative and quantitative assessment. Some of the text associated with OS competency statements were considerably longer than others, with many containing subsections. RAG rating and the presentation of these data graphically gives a three-tiered assessment tool rather than a binary yes/no assessment to take into consideration the complexity of qualitative comparison. ‘Traffic lighting’ guided discussion between the assessors, particularly in those areas of ambiguity, allowing for a consensus grading to be achieved in all cases.

Surgeon led sedation
Our analysis found that the Oral Surgery Curriculum sits within the OMFS Training curriculum except for competencies in ‘surgeon led sedation’ ( Fig. 1 ).

The Intercollegiate Advisory Committee for Sedation in Dentistry (IACSD) developed standards for the safe delivery of sedation by dental teams in the UK; these were updated in 2020. 7 It details the training required by members of the dental team to provide sedation, including mentored cases.

The Association of Medical Royal Colleges (AMRoC) 9 highlights the requirement of all professionals involved in the provision of conscious sedation to have relevant airway management and life support skills (both of which are covered by the OMFS curriculum). The demonstration of continued professional development required by AMRoC would be demonstrated for OMFS trainees at their Annual Record of Competency Progression (ARCP). It would be expected that OMFS trainees could, if they wished, be able to demonstrate the relevant competencies defined by the AMRoC, if they did not already have IACSD documentation.

Emergencies and on-call
The complete lack of concordance of the OS curriculum with OMFS CIP 2 ‘management of an unselected emergency take’ and the OMFS Critical Procedures is one of the most important differences between the OMFS and OS curricula. This represents a significant change between the 2023 OS curriculum and the previous iteration with the new document requiring ‘experience of’ rather than ‘competence in’ these areas. This change may not yet be noted by hospitals, commissioning bodies or trainees. Competence at Level 4 for independent practice in these areas would be essential for participation in an ‘on-call’ rota with consultants in OMFS.

Route 4 for OMFS specialists to join the OS Specialist List
Comparison of both curricula would support the General Dental Council maintaining this simple route for OMFS specialists who wish to join the OS specialist list voiding unnecessary bureaucracy.

Conclusion
Oral Surgery and OMFS in the UK share a common ancestry. For a spell in the 1980s and 1990s there were programmes for those who held solely a dental qualification to complete an academic training pathway 10 and become a Consultant Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon with competencies and skills across the whole OMFS curriculum. This route stopped with the creation of specialists lists in Oral Surgery (dental) and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (medical and dental) in 1996.

Much has happened since the 2008 Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board (PMETB) Report on OMFS Training 11 and the consequent Medical Education England (MEE) review of Oral Surgery Training in 2010. 12 The facts on the ground have changed. Only a very few current oral surgery consultants have a clinical practice which includes the ‘extended competencies’ of the 2013 Oral Surgery curriculum, competencies which have been replaced by ‘experience of’ in the 2023 curriculum. This change was anticipated at the time of the MEE review. 13 The surgical experience of OS specialists in 2010 was nearer to the 2023 than the 2013 curriculum. 14 In the UK and across the world there remains some confusion between the scope of the two specialties. 15

Within many secondary care services, multi-disciplinary teams provide Oral Surgery and Oral and Maxillofacial Services with specialists, doctors and dentists working with integration, cohesion and cooperation. This collaborative working, combined with the problems of coding procedures within secondary care, 16171819 has led to confusion amongst service providers and other stakeholders.

The competencies in the Oral Surgery curriculum overlap with OMFS in the areas of dentoalveolar surgery, oral medicine and oral diagnosis. In the knowledge domains there is considerably more overlap.

Oral Surgery specialists trained to the standards required by the 2023 OS curriculum are appropriately focussed on dentoalveolar surgery with ‘experience of’ but not ‘competency in’ the management of serious cervicofacial infections, serious haemorrhage, facial fractures, sight-threatening emergencies and management of the critically ill patient. If OS specialists participate in on-call rotas, without significant additional training they would need the support of an OMFS specialist who has the competencies to manage an unselected emergency take and unwell inpatients. This may be the decisive factor when a Trust is considering appointing and OS or and OMFS consultant.

This narrowing of the OS curriculum may generate a potential problem for the very experienced solely dentally qualified non-consultant staff whose practice within OMFS departments sits outside the 2023 Oral Surgery curriculum and for current Oral Surgery specialists. In 2024 the General Dental Council stated that temporary dental registrants cannot work in the medical specialty of OMFS 2021 and must restrict themselves to the specialty of Oral Surgery. It is not clear if the GDC considers that a similar approach is required for fully registered dentists nor whether, when it refers to ‘Oral Surgery’, it is referring to the practice defined by the 2023 Oral Surgery curriculum. If the GDC restricts future practice of Oral Surgery specialists and OMFS SAS grades to the Oral Surgery Curriculum it could impact on patient care.

We hope this illustrated comparison will aid those planning and delivering services. It may also give food for through to those considering future careers in either specialty.

The OMFS curriculum, developed by the OMFS Specialty Advisory Committee under the Joint Committee for Surgical Training, integrates core surgical training competencies, is embedded in a broader intercollegiate framework, and defines the syllabus for the FRCS (OMFS) exit exam. In contrast, the OS curriculum, created by the Oral Surgery Specialty Advisory Committee with input from multiple dental and surgical stakeholders, focuses on the core knowledge and skills specific to oral surgery without including extended competencies.

To compare the two, the researchers deconstructed each curriculum into defined domains and mapped competencies using a ‘traffic light’ (Red, Amber, Green) system. Analysis of 127 competency-based statements in the OS curriculum revealed that 93% were fully aligned (green) with OMFS competencies, 6% showed partial overlap (amber), and 1% (related to the independent delivery of inhalational and conscious sedation) had no corresponding element in the OMFS curriculum. Additionally, while index procedures required for independent practice were largely consistent between the curricula, notable differences emerged in areas such as emergency management and on-call competencies.

The study underscores that although OS and OMFS share a common historical foundation, the OS curriculum is now more narrowly focused on dentoalveolar surgery. These distinctions have significant implications for clinical service planning, on-call responsibilities, and future career pathways for specialists in these fields.","This study compares the 2021 Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) and the 2023 Oral Surgery (OS) curricula in the UK, following updates by the General Medical Council and General Dental Council, respectively. Using a ""traffic light"" (RAG) system (Red, Amber, Green) to assess overlap, the analysis maps OS competencies to the OMFS curriculum, and vice versa. Results show significant overlap between the OS and OMFS curricula, particularly in dentoalveolar surgery, oral medicine, and oral diagnosis.

The OS curriculum largely sits within the OMFS framework, with the exception of independent surgeon-led sedation. A key difference lies in emergency management, with the OS curriculum requiring only ""experience of"" managing serious emergencies, while OMFS requires ""competency in"" managing a broad emergency caseload. This distinction has implications for on-call responsibilities and hospital staffing considerations. The authors suggest the GDC maintain the simplified route for OMFS specialists to join the OS specialist list and express concerns about potential restrictions imposed by the GDC on practice of Oral Surgery specialists and OMFS SAS grades to the Oral Surgery Curriculum.","This research paper compares the updated 2021 Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) curriculum with the 2023 Oral Surgery (OS) curriculum in the UK, aiming to clarify the similarities and differences between the two specialties. The OMFS curriculum, developed by the OMFS Specialty Advisory Committee, integrates surgical training and requires dual qualification in medicine and dentistry, while the OS curriculum, overseen by the Oral Surgery Specialty Advisory Committee, focuses on dental qualifications and core oral surgery skills. The study uses a ""traffic light"" system (Red, Amber, Green) to assess the overlap between the two curricula, with Green indicating substantial overlap, Amber indicating partial overlap, and Red indicating no overlap.

The analysis reveals that 93% of OS competencies overlap with OMFS, particularly in dentoalveolar surgery, oral medicine, and oral diagnosis. However, key differences exist, such as the OS curriculum's requirement for independent competency in surgeon-led sedation, which is not covered in OMFS. Additionally, OMFS includes competencies in managing life-threatening emergencies, such as airway compromise, severe infections, and facial trauma, which are only ""experienced"" but not independently practiced in OS. This distinction is critical for on-call responsibilities, as OMFS specialists are trained to handle unselected emergency cases, whereas OS specialists are not.

The study highlights the implications of these differences for service planning and career choices. While OS specialists are well-suited for dentoalveolar surgery, OMFS specialists are equipped to manage broader, more complex surgical and emergency cases. The authors suggest that the narrowing of the OS curriculum may impact non-consultant dental staff working in OMFS departments, as their practices may fall outside the 2023 OS curriculum.

The surgery first approach can be effective at correcting both Class II and Class III malocclusion types with reduced treatment times.","Introduction
In the surgery-first approach (SFA) to orthognathic treatment, the surgery is performed without the need for presurgical orthodontic treatment. Dental decompensation has traditionally been considered an essential component of orthognathic surgery, and a move towards carrying out the necessary tooth movements entirely postoperatively represents a paradigm shift in the treatment pathway.
The objectives of pre-surgical orthodontics in the conventional orthodontics-first approach (OFA) are to align, level, and co-ordinate the dental arches to achieve maximum interdigitation of the planned postoperative occlusion.1-3 An accurately fitting occlusion helps to locate the jaws into the planned post-surgical relationship and the degree of incisor decompensation dictates the magnitude of the anteroposterior jaw movement, as well as potentially aiding postoperative stability. However, this approach has the undesirable effect of accentuating the patient’s malocclusion and facial dysmorphology, which has been found to reduce quality of life measures in the preoperative period.4,5
In addition, OFA tends to involve extended treatment times, with orthodontic appliances in place for 18–28 months pre-surgically and 12–24 months post-surgically.2,3,6 This has been found to result in patient dissatisfaction7 and increases the risk of iatrogenic tooth damage.8,9 By contrast, SFA has been shown to greatly reduce the overall length of treatment.10,11
For SFA to be acceptable, it is important that the quality of occlusions achieved are comparable with those reported for conventional OFA. Several studies have assessed the occlusal outcomes for OFA patients using the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR),12-15 but there is a lack of studies assessing occlusal outcomes for SFA patients, with only Liao et al (2010)16 using PAR (with North American Weighting) on Taiwanese subjects and finding mean reductions of 88% and 92% for SFA and OFA groups, respectively. Our own previous study, comparing PAR scores for Class III SFA and OFA patients, found median percentage PAR reductions of 90% and 88%, respectively.11 However, the sample was restricted to patients having Le Fort I maxillary advancement only and did not represent the full range of malocclusions and surgical procedures being treated through our clinic.
Aim of the study
This study was aimed at assessing the treatment durations and occlusal outcomes for a consecutive cohort of patients, with a range of dentofacial deformities, who have completed orthognathic treatment in our unit, using SFA.
Material and methods
Approval for this retrospective service evaluation study was granted by the local Clinical Governance Committee. The subjects were consecutive orthognathic patients who were managed by a single multidisciplinary team in one teaching hospital between 2014 and 2021. Patients with craniofacial syndromes, and/or cleft deformities, were excluded, as well as patients who had had previous surgery to the jaws or comprehensive orthodontic treatment. For all patients, the surgical movements were planned using 3D soft tissue prediction software (KLS Martin), and 3D printed occlusal wafers were used as surgical guides. The prediction planning of the postoperative occlusion was determined digitally in conjunction with the dental casts.
The duration of treatment was measured from the day of placement to the day of removal of the orthodontic appliances. In all cases, the upper and lower fixed orthodontic appliances were placed within a few days prior to surgery.
The overall change in occlusion, and the quality of the final occlusion, were evaluated using the patients’ orthodontically trimmed pre- and post-treatment study casts. A single, independent, calibrated operator carried out the PAR scores, using UK weighting, and scoring was repeated on 30 sets of models a minimum of one week later, to test intraoperator reliability.
Results
A total of 51 patients completed surgery-first treatment during the study period. The mean (range) age at surgery was 23.3 (15–47) years, with 38 females and 13 males. The pre-treatment malocclusion was Class III in 39 cases (Figs. 1–3), and Class II in 12 cases (Figs. 4–6). Surgery involved Le Fort 1 osteotomy only in 27 cases, bilateral sagittal split osteotomy only in 12 cases, bi-maxillary surgery in 11 cases, and segmental maxillary osteotomy in one case only. Three of the patients had significant facial asymmetries. Orthodontic treatment was carried out on a non-extraction basis in 43 cases and with extractions in eight.

The mean (SD) overall treatment duration was 11.7 (5.7) months, with a range of 4.5–32 months. The mean (SD) number of outpatient orthodontic appointments was 15 (4), with a range of 8–26.
The number of cases for which both pre- and post-treatment study models were available to carry out PAR scores was 43. Intraexaminer reliability between first and second scorings was assessed using Bland Altman plots, mean score differences, and 95% limits of agreement, for 24 cases. The mean difference between first and second scorings was 0.39 (SD = 2.37), which was within the acceptable mean difference of <2 points.17
The median preoperative PAR score was 43.5, which ranged from 15 to 57. The median post-treatment score was 5 and ranged from 2 to 15. The median of the absolute reduction was 38, which ranged from 15 to 47. The overall percentage of the improvement of the PAR score was 88%, which ranged from 57 to 96.
The PAR data for the whole sample showed that 39 case were ‘greatly improved’, and four cases were ‘improved’, with no cases being ‘worse/no better’. For the cases that were ‘improved’, one had a post-treatment PAR score of > 10, along with three others in the sample. Three of these cases had an absolute PAR reduction of > 22 points and therefore were still in the ‘greatly improved’ category.
Discussion
The findings of this study support the evidence in the literature for the shorter treatment duration of SFA cases in comparison with OFA. Possible reasons for this are the single phase of postoperative orthodontic treatment, and the reduced resistance to tooth movement from the orofacial tissues following correction of the skeletal jaw relationship.18 Other contributing factors may be the reduced masticatory muscle activity and bite force, along with fewer occlusal contacts and interferences in the immediate postoperative period.19 Orthodontic tooth movement during the first few months may also be more rapid due to the so-called regional acceleratory phenomenon, owing to the increased cellular and metabolic activity resulting from surgical trauma.20,21 The mean number of outpatient appointments recorded in our study is broadly in agreement with that found by Uribe et al (2015),22 and in close agreement with that of our previous study.11 This suggests an additional benefit for both patients and clinicians of a reduced number of outpatient appointments, which is potentially accompanied by a cost saving.
Whilst the immediate correction of the jaw discrepancy is a key benefit of SFA, it has the potential disadvantage of producing a post-surgical ‘secondary malocclusion’, which then requires orthodontic correction.21-24 The suitability of patients for the SFA in this study depended, to a large extent, on how easily the orthodontist judged the correction of the secondary malocclusion to be, and careful planning between the surgeon and orthodontist was required to agree the soft tissue, skeletal, and occlusal goals. Where the postoperative arch co-ordination was judged to be inadequate, and the orthodontics too unpredictable, the SFA was rejected in favour of conventional OFA. Accentuated or asymmetrical curves of Spee, particularly on the upper dental arch, transverse discrepancies, excessive occlusal interferences, or the need to separate roots to allow segmental surgical cuts, all tended to contraindicate SFA. The lack of a well-defined post-surgical occlusion, the perceived unpredictability of the post-surgical orthodontic treatment and the possibility that it might lead to an unsatisfactory orthodontic result, may be a deterrent to the wider adoption of the SFA.
Over the last ten years our multidisciplinary team has broadened the scope of the inclusion criteria for the SFA. Our current philosophy is that the SFA should be considered for all patients initially, with the exception of those for which a limited phase of orthodontic treatment may adequately address their concern. We have found this to be case in some Class II, division 2 patients, where proclination and alignment of their upper incisors have eliminated the need for surgery.
The PAR scores for the cohort of SFA patients in this study compare favourably with those of several other studies of conventional OFA patients. Out of 100 consecutive patients, Almutairi et al (2017)12 found 99% to be ‘improved’, and 82% to be ‘greatly improved’, while a mean reduction of 72% has been reported, in a multi-centre prospective study of 71 cases.13 Jeremiah et al (2012)14 found a 90.6% reduction, in a retrospective multicentre study of 108 patients. Similar results were reported from a retrospective study at Kings College, London, involving 73 patients.15 In our study, over 90% of the patients were in the ‘greatly improved’ category, with a median post-treatment PAR score of 5.
In the SFA, the post-surgical occlusion tends to be less well interdigitated, with fewer occlusal contacts, than would be expected in OFA patients. This might be expected to adversely affect surgical stability in the early postoperative healing phase, but this is not generally supported by the findings of previous studies,10,25 as well as a systematic review,26 although it is acknowledged that further high-quality studies are required for more conclusive evidence. A disadvantage of SFA is that the light aligning orthodontic arch wires (that are in place when the patient undergoes surgery) prevent the application of the surgical hooks that are commonly used in OFA cases to facilitate intermaxillary elastics. Intermaxillary traction is often important in counteracting surgical relapse, and bone anchorage was used in most cases in this study as a substitute for surgical hooks. Bone screws, or temporary anchorage devices (TAD), have the advantage that they allow traction to be applied directly to the skeletal bases, rather than the teeth. To monitor surgical and occlusal stability in the early postoperative period, the patients in this study were followed up weekly for the first month or so, adjusting the tension and direction of intermaxillary elastics as required. Orthodontic adjustments were started as soon as comfortable intraoral access was possible. The patients were seen biweekly for a further two months, and then every three to four weeks, until the end of treatment. The TADs were typically removed after around eight weeks once full healing had occurred. Intermaxillary elastic wear was continued between the fixed appliances to assist orthodontic tooth movement, where necessary, once rectangular arch wires were in place.
To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the largest assessment of patients treated with the surgery-first approach, using the PAR index, with UK weighting, and including all malocclusion groups. The retrospective nature of the study was a limitation, in that some patients’ study casts were missing and so could not be scored. Also, the suitability of the patients for SFA was judged subjectively, based on the clinical experience of the orthodontist, and no matched group of OFA patients was available for comparison.
Whilst the orthodontics-first approach to orthognathic treatment is widely practised, SFA increasingly shows the potential to benefit suitable patients. The sharing of experiences between clinical teams with an interest in the approach would help to refine the technique and could lead to larger multicentre studies. The establishment of national guidelines would be beneficial to more clearly define the suitability criteria, and limitations, of the approach. It is debatable if a prospective randomised study should be considered to compare SFA with the more conventional OFA for patients who are suitable for both approaches, since it could be considered unethical to offer OFA in cases that would clearly benefit from the shortened treatment duration and reduced anxiety that SFA offers.
Conclusions
The duration of treatment found for this cohort of surgery-first orthognathic patients was considerably shorter in comparison to those published for conventional orthodontics-first patients. The standard of occlusal outcomes was satisfactory and compared favourably with those of previous studies. The SFA was found to be effective in the correction of both Class II and Class III malocclusions in suitable patients.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission
Local approval for this study was obtained. Patient permission was also obtained.","This study investigates the surgery-first approach (SFA) in orthognathic treatment, a method that reverses the traditional sequence by performing surgery before any presurgical orthodontics. Traditionally, the orthodontics-first approach (OFA) requires extensive presurgical treatment to align and decompensate the dental arches, which often exacerbates malocclusion and facial dysmorphology, negatively impacting patient quality of life and extending overall treatment duration to as long as 30–50 months. In contrast, SFA aims to immediately correct skeletal discrepancies, followed by a single phase of postoperative orthodontic adjustments that may benefit from accelerated tooth movement due to regional metabolic changes after surgery.

The retrospective study evaluated 51 consecutive patients treated between 2014 and 2021 at a teaching hospital. Excluding cases with craniofacial syndromes, cleft deformities, or prior jaw surgeries, the research used 3D soft tissue prediction software for surgical planning and 3D-printed occlusal wafers as guides. Treatment duration, measured from the placement to removal of orthodontic appliances, averaged 11.7 months, and the quality of occlusion was assessed using the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) index. The results demonstrated a median PAR score reduction of 88%, with most cases classified as ‘greatly improved.’

The findings suggest that SFA can achieve comparable occlusal outcomes to OFA while significantly reducing treatment time and the number of orthodontic appointments. However, its success depends on careful patient selection and meticulous coordination between the surgical and orthodontic teams. The study advocates for further multicentre research and the development of national guidelines to refine patient selection criteria and optimize SFA protocols.","This study investigates the surgery-first approach (SFA) in orthognathic treatment, where surgery precedes orthodontics, aiming to assess treatment duration and occlusal outcomes. The conventional orthodontics-first approach (OFA) involves lengthy pre-surgical orthodontics, which can exacerbate malocclusion and extend treatment time, increasing patient dissatisfaction. SFA aims to address these issues by reducing treatment duration.

The study retrospectively analyzed 51 SFA patients with varying dentofacial deformities treated at a single center. Treatment duration and occlusal outcomes, measured by the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) index, were assessed. Results showed a mean treatment duration of 11.7 months, considerably shorter than OFA. PAR scores demonstrated a median reduction of 38 points, with an 88% overall improvement, comparable to OFA studies. The authors conclude that SFA offers shorter treatment times and satisfactory occlusal outcomes for suitable patients with Class II and Class III malocclusions, highlighting the importance of careful case selection and interdisciplinary collaboration.","This research paper evaluates the outcomes of the surgery-first approach (SFA) in orthognathic treatment, where surgery is performed without presurgical orthodontics, contrasting it with the conventional orthodontics-first approach (OFA). The study, conducted at a teaching hospital between 2014 and 2021, involved 51 patients with Class II and Class III malocclusions, treated using SFA. The mean treatment duration was 11.7 months, significantly shorter than OFA, which typically takes 18–28 months presurgically and 12–24 months postsurgically. The study assessed occlusal outcomes using the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) index, finding a median PAR score reduction of 88%, with 90% of cases classified as ""greatly improved.""

Key benefits of SFA include immediate correction of jaw discrepancies, reduced treatment time, and fewer outpatient appointments (mean of 15 visits). The approach also avoids the preoperative worsening of malocclusion and facial appearance seen in OFA, which can negatively impact patients' quality of life. However, SFA requires careful planning to manage the postoperative ""secondary malocclusion"" and relies on postoperative orthodontics to achieve final occlusal goals. Bone anchorage devices (TADs) were used in most cases to facilitate intermaxillary traction, compensating for the lack of surgical hooks.

The study highlights the effectiveness of SFA in treating both Class II and Class III malocclusions, with occlusal outcomes comparable to OFA. Limitations include the retrospective design and subjective patient selection criteria. The authors advocate for further research, including prospective randomized studies, to refine SFA guidelines and establish its suitability for a broader patient population. Overall, SFA offers a viable alternative to OFA, particularly for patients seeking shorter treatment times and immediate aesthetic improvements.",12,2.8,17.3,,,90,95,10,100,80,85,10,95,88,90,15,100

The overall survival rate for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNC) has remained largely unchanged over the last 50 years despite advances in locoregional control. 1 Mortality is most commonly attributed to locoregional failure or the development of distant metastases.

Lungs are the most common site for distant metastasis 23 and synchronous or metachronous malignancy, 4 given the shared risk factors. These findings at initial presentation can significantly change the treatment regimen and survival prognosis.

Assessment of the thorax was historically conducted by plain radiographs, as recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. 5 However, chest radiographs have low sensitivity for identifying early pulmonary malignancies, as nodules smaller than 1 cm are not visible. 67

Computed tomography (CT) of the chest has become increasingly recognised as the standard of care 89 in the workup for head and neck cancer. Whilst some centres selectively screen patients with only T4 or N2/N3 disease, or tumour in the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or supraglottis, 10 most perform screening routinely for all newly diagnosed head and neck malignancies. CT of the chest offers superior spatial and contrast resolution in the detection of sub-centimetre nodules. The clinical significance of these incidentally encountered pulmonary nodules is, however, still unclear.

The Fleischner Society (FS) and British Thoracic Society (BTS) have each developed guidelines for the management of pulmonary nodules. Whilst the FS guidelines are not intended for patients with known malignancies, 6 the BTS guidelines are based only on data from eight studies with a total of 182 HNC patients. 11 Common to both are high-risk radiological features suggestive of malignancy: multiple nodules of subsolid type and those of larger size.

There is no management algorithm at present specific to HNC, and the investigation of pulmonary nodules often relies on local institutional policies. Clinical and radiological surveillance intervals to confirm or exclude pulmonary metastasis vary across different multidisciplinary committees. The threshold for repeat interval scanning and early biopsy of suspicious nodules should be tailored based on the biological behaviour of HNC. Early detection of a pulmonary metastasis may significantly alter the proposed treatment for the patient so it is invaluable to be able to determine which nodules are more likely to be metastases on initial screening.

This study aimed to retrospectively review the outcomes of incidental pulmonary nodules detected on initial staging CT of the chest in HNC patients treated with curative intent from a high-volume cancer centre, and to determine the features that increase the probability of pulmonary nodules being distant metastases.

Methods
This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single institution that included newly diagnosed oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients with pulmonary nodules on initial staging CT during the period 2010 to 2015. Cutaneous SCC was excluded from the study.

Patient demographics such as age, gender, smoking status, alcohol use, and HNC characteristics were gathered from clinical notes. Pulmonary nodules described in radiological reports were extracted for type, size, number, and location.

Nodules were considered benign or malignant based on histological or radiological findings after multidisciplinary discussion, or lung biopsy. Nodules that were recommended for ongoing surveillance and interval scanning were deemed ‘indeterminant’. All patients had a minimum of five years of follow up.

Patients were then stratified into benign, malignant, or indeterminant groups depending on the outcome of the nodules. Only those who developed metastasis within the malignant group were included in the comparison with the benign group in terms of T classification, N classification, overall HNC staging, disease site, type, size, number, and location of pulmonary nodules. Fisher’s exact test was used to identify any statistical difference at a 95% confidence interval (p = 0.05).

Results
Of 579 patients, 154 (26.6%) had pulmonary nodules detected on staging chest CT. The outcomes of these pulmonary nodules are summarised in Table 1 .

Over 20% of these were found to be malignant during the study period. At the time of HNC diagnosis, two patients had a synchronous lung cancer and six had lung metastasis. Four patients later developed lung cancer during surveillance. A further 26 patients were found to have metastases to the lungs within the follow-up period, equivalent to an incidence of 13%. The median (range) time for malignant transformation of pulmonary nodules was 11 (1–91) months. Twenty-three of 26 patients were diagnosed with lung metastases less than two years into the follow-up period.

The majority (66.9%) of pulmonary nodules were related to benign processes such as inflammation, granuloma, and sarcoidosis. Eight patients still had indeterminant nodules at the time of data collection (four died prior to repeat imaging, one relocated to another health service, one was lost to follow up, and two were awaiting further investigations).

When comparing benign nodules and pulmonary metastases, both study groups were similar in the baseline characteristics such as age, gender, and smoking and alcohol status ( Table 2 ). The sites of disease were in the oral cavity and oropharynx with equal proportions in both groups. The mean follow-up period for patients in the benign group was 51 months whilst in the metastasis group it was 23 months, predominantly due to the death of patients.

Only nodal status (based on the eighth edition TNM classification system for HNC) was significantly different between the benign and metastasis groups (p = 0.02). Tumour size (p = 1) and overall staging of disease (stage I: p = 0.17; stage II: p = 0.77; stage III: p = 0.69; stage IVa: p = 0.12; stage IVb: p = 1) were not significant predictive factors for lung nodules to be metastases.

Using the criteria set out in the FS and BTS guidelines, the size and number of pulmonary nodules (p = 0.64) was not found to be a factor in predicting malignant transformation. Bilaterally present pulmonary nodules did not appear to be significant in predicting metastasis (p = 0.16). Isolated right pulmonary nodules were more likely to be benign (p = 0.01). Subsolid-type nodules were significantly more likely to indicate lung metastasis (p = 0.03).

Discussion
Pulmonary nodules are defined as “focal rounded opacity ≤ 3cm diameter, mostly surrounded by aerated lung, including contact with pleura but without potentially related abnormalities in the thorax”. 11

In this single institution retrospective cohort study, our results indicate that some disease characteristics and nodular features are statistically significant in predicting the presence of lung metastasis. As far as can be ascertained, there is no study to date with a minimum follow-up duration of five years. An extended follow-up period allowed us to capture the malignant transformation of indeterminant pulmonary nodules over time. Our incidence of lung metastasis was 13%, which is on the lower end of the documented rates, which range from 9% 12 to 66%. 13 The malignancy rate of pulmonary nodules in HNC patients is not well defined in current literature as most studies fail to differentiate between lung metastasis and lung primary in their reporting. Interestingly, the rate of synchronous or metachronous malignancies in our study cohort was less than 1% despite available literature reporting figures up to 20%. 471014 This discrepancy is predominantly attributed to the differences in the inclusion criteria and sample size. The available literature included HNC arising from the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, supraglottis, and glottis sites whilst our study only included patients with oral and oropharyngeal SCC. Loh et al found in their prospective cohort study that primary disease in the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and supraglottis was five times more likely to demonstrate abnormalities in a chest CT compared with primary disease in the oral cavity and glottis. 10 Compared with our study, the smaller sample size in the available literature may also overestimate the rate of synchronous or metachronous malignancy. Smoking status and alcohol consumption at the time of diagnosis did not seem to relate to the incidence of lung metastases.

Disease
The data from this study add to the growing body of HNC literature that aims to address the gap regarding pulmonary nodules and in turn to inform the development of HNC-specific guidelines. It is not unreasonable to postulate that more advanced disease increases the risk of pulmonary metastasis. Whilst tumour size was not statistically significant, patients with nodal involvement exceeding 3 cm in the greatest dimension or multiple involved nodes (N2/N3) were found to be three times more likely to have metastatic pulmonary nodules. Two of 11 patients had lung metastases at the time of diagnosis, while seven of 11 patients were found to have metastases in the first year of surveillance. Our findings are consistent with the systematic review by McLeod et al in which patients with N0/N1 disease were significantly less likely than those with N2/N3 disease to have a positive chest CT. 15 In their retrospective analysis of 192 HNC SCC patients, Hsu et al also found that N2/N3 disease, stage IV disease, recurrent disease, and distant metastasis were predictors for concurrent pulmonary neoplasms. 13 The overall staging of oral and oropharyngeal SCC was not a significant predictive factor for lung nodules to be metastases.

Nodules
Our study describes pertinent features of pulmonary nodules (size, number, morphology, and location) which may be predictive factors for metastasis. No association was demonstrated between nodule number or size and risk of metastasis irrespective of the classification used. Green et al drew similar conclusions in their retrospective cohort study of 400 consecutive patients, thereby encouraging serial imaging to be performed for all sizes of nodule. 16 Nodule multiplicity was shown to increase the risk of primary cancer in the NELSON trial, 17 but this was not found to apply to lung metastasis in our study. Nodules in the right lung were three times more likely to be benign. This may be related to the fact that patients with oral and oropharyngeal cancer may develop progressive dysphagia resulting in silent aspiration, and this may manifest as inflammatory nodules in the lung.

Subsolid-type pulmonary nodules are 13 times more likely to be lung metastases when compared with solid types. Subsolid morphology refers to pure ground-glass or part-solid lesions that remain partially invisible on CT when viewed on a mediastinal (soft-tissue) window setting. 6 Subsolid nodules are known to have a higher propensity to be malignant as evidenced by closer follow-up intervals and longer follow-up duration. 611 In their systematic review, Young et al suggested that pulmonary metastasectomy may offer survival benefits for HNC patients with pulmonary metastases. 18 Early diagnosis of metastasis with pulmonary nodule biopsy is therefore essential. Despite this, however, one third of positive transthoracic needle aspiration biopsies of pulmonary nodules in HNC have been found to be indeterminant malignancies (accuracy 81%, sensitivity 94%, negative predictive value 60%). 19 How this extrapolates specifically to oral and oropharyngeal cancer remains unknown, but there seems to be an argument for high-risk patients with equivocal nodules to be offered early biopsy as part of routine investigation. The biopsy result may affect whether patients are treated with a curative or palliative treatment plan.

Summary of recommendations
Based on supporting data from this study, it is our recommendation that all oral and oropharyngeal cancer patients with incidental pulmonary nodules on staging CT of the chest be monitored with serial CT every six months, regardless of nodule size, for a minimum duration of two years. If the nodules remain unchanged in size or characteristics, then no further interval scanning is required. Patients with N2/N3 disease are considered high risk and should be reviewed every three months with repeat CT in the first year. The presence of subsolid nodules appears to be the most important feature of a nodule to suggest metastasis. We therefore recommend biopsy of these nodules if possible prior to deciding on curative or palliative treatment for patients with oral or oropharyngeal SCC.

Limitations
There are some limitations to our retrospective study. The variable quality of the CT reports meant that broader categories had to be used in the subgroup analysis of number, size, and location of pulmonary nodules. The exact number (if more than one) of pulmonary nodules was not always stated so patients were only stratified as ‘single’ or ‘multiple’. The location of the nodules was in the right, left, or both lungs, as analysis based on anatomical lobes was not possible. It was not always clearly reported from which plane the diameter measurements were taken even though the maximum dimension of the largest nodule should be used by convention. When descriptors such as ‘small’ and ‘tiny’ were used instead of measurements, for the purpose of data analysis it was assumed the pulmonary nodules were of the smallest size in the FS and BTS guidelines. The interpretation of imaging is subjective in nature and often dependent on the experience of the radiologist. 12 Interobserver and intraobserver agreement of patient risk stratification can be highly unreliable, 6 resulting in inconsistencies in the intervals for repeat imaging.

Most of the results in this study failed to achieve statistical significance, which is likely to be due to the small sample size. Given that the incidence of HNC is 12400 per year in the United Kingdom, 20 the sample size required to achieve significance at a 95% confidence interval was 375 patients. We are embarking on a larger ambispective study to evaluate the long-term significance of indeterminant lung nodules in all head and neck SCC patients, rather than focusing on oral and oropharyngeal SCCs only. To resolve some of the limitations of this study, information about every patient screened, rather than just those with evidence of a lung nodule, will be recorded to ensure accurate comparison between subgroups.

There has been growing interest in the development of validated clinical tools to predict the biological behaviour of HNC. The Brandwein-Gensler histological score 21 and circulating tumour cells 22 are some examples that correlate tumour-host interaction and disease recurrence. These surrogate biomarkers and risk models may eventually help to identify high-risk patients, guide adjuvant treatment, and dictate follow-up intervals for HNC patients in the future.

Conclusion
Incidental lung nodules are commonly identified on staging CT of the chest in oral and oropharyngeal cancer patients. In this study 26.6% of patients had an incidental nodule with one fifth of these being malignant over a five-year follow-up period. Patients with N2/N3 disease increase the probability of incidental pulmonary nodules being metastases, warranting closer review intervals in the first year. Meanwhile indeterminant nodules only in the right lung in patients with no neck disease (N0) are less likely to be metastases. Subsolid pulmonary nodules carry a high risk of being metastases, which is congruent with existing evidence in similar studies. It is therefore our recommendation to biopsy subsolid nodules prior to deciding on the definitive treatment for HNC. Pulmonary nodule management based on current guidelines (FS and BTS) does not appear to be adequate for patients with oral and oropharyngeal SCC. The development of a HNC-specific protocol for incidental pulmonary nodules would provide further clarity as to the interval and duration of clinical and radiological surveillance required.

","This retrospective study investigated incidental pulmonary nodules found on staging chest CT in patients with newly diagnosed oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to determine which features predict metastatic potential. Given that overall survival for head and neck cancer (HNC) has not improved despite advances in locoregional control, early detection of lung metastasis is critical for optimal treatment planning.

The study reviewed 579 patients treated with curative intent from 2010 to 2015, of whom 154 (26.6%) had pulmonary nodules on initial CT. These nodules were classified as benign, indeterminate, or malignant, with 13% of patients ultimately developing lung metastases. While patient demographics (age, gender, smoking, and alcohol use) and primary tumor site did not significantly differ between benign and metastatic groups, nodal status (N classification) emerged as a significant predictor; patients with N2/N3 disease were three times more likely to have metastatic nodules. Additionally, subsolid-type nodules were strongly associated with malignancy, whereas isolated nodules in the right lung tended to be benign.

Based on these findings, the authors recommend serial CT surveillance for all patients with incidental nodules over a minimum of two years. High-risk patients (those with N2/N3 disease) should undergo more frequent imaging (every three months in the first year), and subsolid nodules should be biopsied to guide treatment decisions. The study also highlights the inadequacy of current guidelines (Fleischner Society and British Thoracic Society) for HNC patients and suggests that developing HNC-specific protocols could improve management and outcomes. Limitations include its retrospective design and variable CT report quality, prompting plans for a larger ambispective study.","This retrospective study examined incidental pulmonary nodules found during initial staging CT scans in patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HNC). It aimed to identify features predictive of metastasis. Of 579 patients, 26.6% had pulmonary nodules, with over 20% being malignant during the study. 13% developed lung metastasis within the follow-up period.

Nodal involvement (N2/N3) significantly increased the likelihood of nodules being metastatic. Subsolid nodules were also strongly associated with metastasis. Nodule size, number, and location, apart from right sided nodules, were not predictive. Existing pulmonary nodule guidelines (Fleischner Society and British Thoracic Society) may be inadequate for HNC patients.

The authors recommend close monitoring with serial CT scans every six months for two years for all oral and oropharyngeal cancer patients with incidental pulmonary nodules, regardless of size, with more frequent review (every three months) for N2/N3 patients. Biopsy of subsolid nodules is recommended before definitive treatment decisions. Further research is needed to develop HNC-specific pulmonary nodule management protocols.","This research paper investigates the significance of incidental pulmonary nodules detected on initial staging CT scans in patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The study, conducted at a high-volume cancer center, retrospectively analyzed 579 patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2015, with 154 (26.6%) having pulmonary nodules. Over a minimum five-year follow-up, 20% of these nodules were malignant, with 13% representing lung metastases. The study aimed to identify features predictive of malignancy, such as nodule size, type, location, and patient disease characteristics.

Key findings revealed that subsolid nodules were 13 times more likely to be metastases compared to solid nodules. Patients with advanced nodal disease (N2/N3) were three times more likely to have metastatic nodules, while nodules in the right lung were more likely benign. Tumor size and overall cancer stage were not significant predictors. The study recommends closer surveillance for high-risk patients (N2/N3 disease) and early biopsy of subsolid nodules to guide treatment decisions.

Limitations include the retrospective design, small sample size, and variability in CT reporting. The authors advocate for a head and neck cancer-specific protocol for managing pulmonary nodules, emphasizing the need for larger, prospective studies to refine surveillance intervals and improve early detection of metastases. This research highlights the importance of tailored follow-up strategies for incidental lung nodules in oral and oropharyngeal SCC patients.",15,3.2,16.21,,,90,95,10,100,82,88,10,95,85,90,10,95

The PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched from inception to 23 November 2022. Two reviewers screened for articles that reported occlusion/malocclusion class type as I, II, or III, and reported preoperative and postoperative AHI, LSAT, ODI, ESS, and/or BMI. Two reviewers independently screened title/abstracts and subsequently, full-text articles that met eligibility criteria. Preoperative ESS and ODI were significantly higher in Class II (13.77, 95% CI, 11.38% to 16.17% and 47.49, 95% CI, 33.04% to 61.95%) than in Class III (12.47, 95% CI, 9.95% to 14.99% and 32.47, 95% CI, -10.37% to 75.30%) (p¬†<¬†0.0001).

Additionally, amongst all malocclusion classes and operative status, meta-regression showed positive correlations between ESS and AHI (r¬†=¬†0.94, p¬†<¬†0.001) and ESS and ODI (r¬†=¬†0.90, p¬†<¬†0.001). Class I subjects with no dentofacial discrepancy had the greatest improvement in AHI compared with Class II and III. Class II subjects may express more severe ODI and ESS preoperatively compared with Class III subjects. Additionally, subjective outcomes (ESS) may be a predictor for objective outcomes (AHI and ODI) for patients undergoing MMA.","Introduction
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep-related breathing disorder characterised by  ≥
  five episodes of airflow interruptions or decrements per hour due to upper airway collapsibility and intermittent episodic hypoxaemia. 1 Well-established risk factors for OSA include male sex, obesity, and older age. 2 Untreated OSA can have deleterious health consequences, including increased cardiovascular disease, stroke, and traffic accidents, 3 with reported increased healthcare utilisation, 4 and is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality. 5 To improve polysomnography (PSG) outcomes and Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), treatment options include non-surgical options like lifestyle changes, positive airway pressure, or mandibular advancement devices. Surgical options like soft-tissue surgery, hypoglossal nerve stimulators, and skeletal surgery can be effective treatments after first-line therapy failure or as an alternative for non-adherent patients.

Maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) is a skeletal surgical option for patients suffering from OSA with a surgical success rate varying from 57% to 86% in well-selected patients. 678910 This procedure expands the skeletal framework, increasing the anterior-posterior and transverse airway dimensions. 11 Indications include anatomically predisposed OSA patients with dentofacial deformities, those with complete concentric collapse of the velum associated with lateral pharyngeal wall collapse, and severe OSA with or without obesity. 1213 Previous studies of MMA in patients with dentofacial deformities were shown to have improved PSG outcomes; 714151617 however, studies that compare surgical outcomes using PSG within dentofacial deformities subgroups are less well elucidated. These subgroups include Class I, II, and III occlusion types. Malocclusions are defined classically by the misalignment between the upper and lower molars, that could result from a dental or a skeletal aetiology. 18 In these patients, MMA surgery aids in reducing obstructive episodes and improving desaturations during sleep while optimising occlusion and facial harmony.

We performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of studies that reported preoperative and postoperative MMA surgery outcomes in patients diagnosed with OSA with Classes I, II, and III malocclusions. The purpose of our meta-analysis was to compare the PSG and subjective metrics between malocclusion classes and determine if the malocclusion class plays a role in baseline and postoperative outcomes.

Methods
Search criteria
This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 19 A comprehensive literature search of PubMed (U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health), Scopus (Elsevier), and CINAHL (EBSCO) was performed from inception until 23 November 2022. The PubMed search strategy included a combination of subject headings (such as MeSH in PubMed) and keywords for obstructive sleep apnoea, maxillomandibular advancement, and malocclusion. All references were uploaded to the review management software Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation Ltd) and screened for relevance. When a full-text article was not available or malocclusion data was not clear, we contacted the corresponding authors to retrieve relevant data. ( [CR] ).

Selection criteria
Studies that described cases of both maxillary and mandibular advancement surgery with facial skeletal Classes I, II, and/or III malocclusions were included. Malocclusion facial skeletal class was determined if studies classified patients as Class I, II, or III or if individual cephalometric data on SNA (sella, nasion, point A) angle and SNB (sella, nasion, point B) angle were included. Using SNA and SNB at the patient-level, the ANB (A point, nasion, B point) can be calculated (SNA – SNB = ANB), thus allowing us to determine the malocclusion class based on the ANB. 20 An ANB angle of 1°-4°, greater than 4, and less than or equal to 0 was categorised as Class I, II, and, III, respectively. Globally, Class II patients are subjects with mandibular retrognathia while Class III are subjects with mandibular prognathia. Class I patients have neither. Studies were only included if preoperative and postoperative outcome data of MMA surgery were described. Outcomes included Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI), Lowest O 2 Saturation (LSAT), Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI), Epworth Sleep Scale (ESS), and Body Mass Index (BMI). Studies were excluded if preoperative and postoperative data were not stratified by facial skeletal type or absent skeletal analysis at the patient-level. Studies were also excluded if AHI or LSAT data were not reported. We also excluded studies involving patients with cleft lip/palate, case reports and reviews, reviews not presenting original data, and non-English studies. Two reviewers (S.K. and S.R.S) first independently reviewed titles and abstracts to identify articles that met the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by way of discussion with the senior author. Both reviewers subsequently reviewed full texts independently to identify articles that met the inclusion criteria with disagreements after discussing with the senior author.

Critical appraisal and quality assessment
Each study was evaluated for level of evidence using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based

Medicine (OCEBM) criteria using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 21 ( Table 1 ). 813222324252627282930313233 Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies – of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool was used to assess the risk of bias as this study evaluated non-randomised studies ( [CR] , online only). 34 Risk of bias items included: bias due to confounding data, bias in the selection of participants into the study, bias in the classification of interventions, bias due to deviations from intended interventions, bias due to missing data, bias in the measurement of outcomes, and bias in the selection of the reported results. The risk of bias was graded as either ‘low’, ‘unclear’, or ‘high’. All disagreements in assessing the level of evidence and risk of bias were resolved by two reviewers by way of discussion.

Data extraction
Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and compared for accuracy. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. The author, year, country of study, and demographics (age and gender) were extracted for each included study. Additionally, the preoperative and postoperative AHI, LSAT, ESS, ODI, and BMI were extracted by malocclusion class if given.

Statistical analysis
Meta-analysis of continuous measures (age, reduction of AHI, ODI, and BMI) was performed by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 4 (Biostat Inc). Meta-analysis of mean difference (preoperative versus postoperative values for AHI, ESS, ODI, LSAT and BMI) was performed with Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.4 (The Cochrane Collaboration 2020). Meta-regression was performed using MedCalc 20.305 (MedCalc Software Ltd; https://www.medcalc.org; 2020). Each measure (mean±SD), mean difference (Δ), and regression (r and R 2 ) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were weighted according to the number of patients affected. In addition, a comparison of weighted means was done to compare malocclusion classes for AHI, ESS, ODI, BMI, and LSAT. Both fixed-effects and random-effects models were used. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using χ2 and I 2 statistics with fixed effects (I 2 < 50%) and random effects (I 2 > 50%). 35 Finally, potential publication bias was evaluated by visual inspection of the funnel plot and Egger’s regression test, which statistically examines the asymmetry of the funnel plot ( [CR] , online only). A p value of <0.05 was considered to indicate a significant difference for all statistical tests.

Results
Search results and study characteristics
The initial literature search from databases yielded 2,432 articles. Title and abstract screening excluded 2,233 articles and the subsequent full-text review excluded 186 articles, leaving 13 remaining studies for data extraction and analysis. An additional article that met inclusion criteria was also identified at our institution which was accepted but not published at the time of literature search. 8 A PRISMA flowchart outlines the entire search process, as shown in Fig. 1 . A critical appraisal of the studies indicated an acceptably low risk of bias for most studies except for bias due to confounding and bias due to missing data that were included as outlined in [CR] (online only). Articles selected for inclusion were level 4 studies based on the Oxford Level of Evidence and were published between 2010 and 2022 ( Table 1 ). A funnel plot with Egger’s test (-4.8, 95% CI = −11.6 to 2.0, p = 0.1442) demonstrated that most studies were within the funnel, suggesting little publication bias ( [CR] , online only).

Patient characteristics and amount of advancement in each class
In the quantitative analysis, 261 patients were included, comprising occlusion class I (48), class II (187), and class III (26) ( Table 1 ). Meta-analysis of single means (SD) for maxillary advancements (mm) in class I and II are 10.38 (0.83) and 7.07 (1.20), respectively. The mean (SD) for class III was 11.67 (1.20). Meta-analysis of single means (SD) for mandibular advancements (mm) in class I and II are 8.96 (0.56) and 11.01 (0.59), respectively. Meta-analysis of single means (SD) for age amongst Class I, II, and III patients was 45.04 (1.07), 42.89 (1.37), and 44.36 (8.06), respectively. All patients included in the analysis had an age range of 21-63, and 85% of the 261 patients were males.

Dentofacial skeletal class outcomes
Single means and standard deviation (SD) for age, percent reductions (%), preoperative and postoperative values for AHI, LSAT, ESS, BMI, and ODI for each skeletal malocclusion class are reported in Table 2 . A comparison of single means (Δ) and 95% CI was also performed for preoperative and postoperative values for LSAT, ESS, BMI, and ODI ( Table 2 ). Additionally, a comparison of single means (Δ) and 95% CI for each metric was performed to determine the magnitude of difference and significance between different classes in Table 3 .

Forest plots displaying the mean difference and confidence intervals for AHI, ESS, ODI, and LSAT ( [CR] , online only) after MMA surgery were calculated for each skeletal class, if available. Mean absolute differences and SD were calculated and reported in Table 4 showing a reduction in AHI and ESS in all classes (p < 0.00001), while the LSAT was significantly lower in Classes I and II versus III. ODI reduction was significant in Class II (39.44 [4.15]) versus Class III (25.2 [4.5]). Comparing mean differences (SD) for each metric after MMA between different classes is shown in Table 4 , where the change in AHI, LSAT, and ESS among Class I and II were not significant. However, the change in AHI and LSAT was higher in Class III when compared with I and II.

We found that Class I had more AHI% reduction when compared with Class II and III (89.61 versus 81.18 and 80.24, respectively, p < 0.0001) ( Table 2 ). Similarly, postoperative AHI values in Class I were lower compared with II and III (4.57 [1.46]) versus (9.06 [1.13]) and (10.88 [1.85]), respectively, p < 0.0001 ( Table 2 ). Preoperative ESS and oxygen levels were significantly worse (higher) in Class II than in Class III (13.77 [1.22]) and (47.49 [7.38]) versus (12.47 [1.28]) and (32.47 [21.85]), respectively, p < 0.0001 ( Table 2 ). Class II had a greater overall change in ODI compared with Class III (p < 0.0001) ( Table 2 ). Postoperative ESS was significant and slightly higher among Class II compared with Class III (p = 0.0012) ( Table 3 ). Amongst all malocclusion classes and operative status, meta-regression between AHI and ESS (r = 0.94, p < 0.001) was significant and slightly stronger than ODI and ESS (r = 0.90, p < 0.001) ( [CR] , online only).

Discussion
Double jaw or MMA surgery improves PSG outcomes for patients with all dentofacial deformities, 714151617 however, the outcomes of each occlusion subgroup and the relative difference in outcomes amongst various subgroups have not been highlighted. A closer look was taken for different occlusion classes using skeletal landmarks to determine their association with preoperative and postoperative outcomes, and overall change in metrics.

Our study shows that after MMA, all classes showed a significant reduction in their PSG outcomes with AHI% reduction ranging from 80%-90% out of 219 subjects. On a deeper level, AHI reduction was significantly higher amongst class I versus II and III (p < 0.0001), highlighting the role of MMA in class I subjects with no dentofacial (skeletal) discrepancy. Additionally, class II versus class III malocclusion patients had worse baseline subjective and oxygen metrics, respectively, p < 0.0001 ( Table 2 ). This finding may be due to the retrognathic nature of Class II malocclusion causing a narrow retroglossal airway space, inducing a higher severity of OSA. In comparison with Class III subjects, their relative prognathic mandibles may allow for a larger lower pharyngeal (retroglossal) airway space and may limit the degree of mandibular advancement and postoperative PSG improvement. These results may also provide a plausible conclusion as to why Class II patients exhibited a more pronounced overall change in the ODI compared with Class III (p < 0.05). While Class I showed more AHI reduction when compared with the other malocclusion classes, it was not possible to draw the same conclusion for ODI due to lack of data, knowing that ODI is a more reliable predictor of OSA and its clinically relevant outcomes. 36 The included studies used in the meta-analysis did not report enough data on ODI in Class I subjects, therefore a meta-analysis was not performed. Class II subjects also experienced a significantly greater improvement in ODI than Class III subjects. This validates the impact of MMA on different dentofacial deformities and suggests that clinicians can expect roughly similar outcomes in subjects regardless of occlusion class.

Meta-regression showed significant correlations between ESS with ODI and AHI ( [CR] ). These findings support the theory that subjective outcomes in OSA patients with dentofacial deformities, as measured by ESS, can strongly predict OSA objective outcomes. Therefore, high ESS scores in a clinical setting should warrant further evaluation of OSA amongst different dentofacial deformities.

On the other hand, class I subjects showed the highest surgical success rates based on the percentage reduction in AHI (89.61%). 163738 This can be attributed to the fact that this population receives benefits from expanding both the retrolingual and retropalatal regions relatively equally and therefore can perceive a relatively higher improvement in their baseline objective measures. This is supported by the amount of advancment formerly reported in each class. Mandibular advancement surgery alone showed high success and cure rates, 39 yet maxillary advancement was shown to contribute more to AHI reduction; 6 given the impact on the lateral pharyngeal wall and retropalatal space. 11 Thus, including both movements (comparable number of millimetres in class I) supports the fact that class I patients may have more AHI% reduction. In either class II or III, the expansion in one of the two regions is not as much as the other, since either the maxilla or the mandible may be in a more adequate position than the other limiting its advancement.

Identifying risk factors influencing disease severity in OSA is important in early detection and treatment in the disease course. Additionally, identifying postoperative outcomes is important in aligning expectations for clinicians and patients. By comparing the change in disease metrics for malocclusion Class II and III before and after MMA surgery, we were able to determine if either malocclusion type affects postoperative success. Based on our findings, it is reasonable to expect surgical success in all malocclusion classes. Additionally, we can expect Class II subjects to experience a greater amount of improvement in OSA compared with Class III subjects with similar postoperative outcomes in ODI and ESS.

There is a paucity in the literature regarding MMA outcomes in class III malocclusion patients. A potential explanation is that MMA surgery could be challenging in this subset due to the potential worsening of the lower facial profile. 40 Furthermore, studies have shown that class II malocclusion is more prevalent than class III, 4142 further challenging the ability to compare surgical outcomes. We were only able to collect data on maxillary and mandibular advancements (mm) from three Class III patients as reported by Li et al. 22 However, the mean advancement was not differentiated between the maxilla and mandible. We hypothesise that the reported mean most likely refers to the maxillary advancement.

This study has notable limitations. The dentofacial classification is complex and has many variables and possibilities, however, we used a well-cited metric to simplify the analysis. 20 Another potentially confounding variable is the inability to match subjects by age, race, BMI, and gender. Regarding PSGs, there is a variation in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria used in each study for hypopnoea. Each institute can have its own modifications that may affect MMA outcomes. 79 Regarding surgical success, the percentage reduction was calculated using the mean preoperative and postoperative metrics. For this reason, surgical success was determined by the collective mean rather than individual patient data, given the difficulty of obtaining individual data from some of the articles included, while attempting to contact corresponding authors. It is worth noting that Class I subjects may have had orthodontic correction, yet we used the skeletal classification to account for their occlusion status as best as we could. Lastly, it is worth noting that most Class III subjects were derived from a previous study of ours. 8

Conclusions
Maxillomandibular advancement reduced the AHI, ODI, and ESS and improved LSAT in all skeletal/dentofacial subgroups. Class II subjects had significantly worse OSA severity based on ODI and ESS preoperatively compared with Class III subjects (p < 0.0001). Class II subjects showed a greater improvement in ODI compared with Class III (p < 0.0001), however postoperative ODI and ESS were comparable between both subgroups. Class I with no skeletal discrepancy had the highest reduction in AHI (p < 0.05).Thus, when consdiering MMA candidacy, factors like OSA severity, hypoxemic burden and drug-induced sedation endoscopy findings should be evaluated, and not only the dentofacial deformity. While variable, subjective metrics (ESS) can be a predictor for objective metrics (AHI and ODI) amongst OSA patients undergoing MMA.

OSA is characterized by recurrent breathing interruptions and hypoxaemia, leading to significant health risks. MMA, a surgical option that enlarges the airway by advancing the maxilla and mandible, was analyzed in patients with skeletal Classes I, II, and III malocclusions.

A comprehensive literature search up to November 2022 identified 14 studies comprising 261 patients (48 Class I, 187 Class II, and 26 Class III) reporting preoperative and postoperative outcomes. Key metrics included the Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI), lowest oxygen saturation (LSAT), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and the Epworth Sleep Scale (ESS). MMA produced significant improvements in all objective and subjective measures. Class I patients achieved the highest AHI reduction (approximately 90%), while Class II patients, who presented with worse baseline severity, showed greater ODI improvement compared with Class III. Meta-regression revealed strong correlations between ESS and both AHI and ODI, underscoring the value of subjective sleepiness scores as predictors of objective sleep outcomes.

However, differences in study design and patient characteristics warrant cautious interpretation. Future research should address these limitations to further validate MMA outcomes in diverse malocclusion groups comprehensively.","This meta-analysis investigates the impact of maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) surgery on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) outcomes in patients with different skeletal malocclusion classes (I, II, and III). The study analyzed data from 14 studies, encompassing 261 patients, to compare pre- and post-operative polysomnography (PSG) and subjective metrics (AHI, LSAT, ESS, BMI, and ODI) across these malocclusion groups.

The results indicated that MMA surgery significantly improved OSA outcomes in all malocclusion classes. Notably, Class I patients exhibited the highest reduction in AHI after MMA. Class II patients showed worse pre-operative subjective and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) metrics than Class III, potentially due to a narrower airway space. However, Class II patients experienced a greater improvement in ODI post-surgery. There was a significant correlation between subjective (ESS) and objective (AHI, ODI) measures.

The study concludes that MMA is an effective treatment for OSA across different malocclusion classes. While outcomes vary somewhat between groups, the researchers recommend considering other factors besides dentofacial deformity when assessing MMA candidacy.","This research paper investigates the effectiveness of Maxillomandibular Advancement (MMA) surgery in treating Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) across different dentofacial malocclusion classes (Class I, II, and III). OSA, a prevalent sleep disorder, is characterized by repeated episodes of airflow interruption during sleep, leading to significant health risks such as cardiovascular disease and increased mortality. MMA surgery, which expands the skeletal framework to increase airway dimensions, is a surgical option for OSA patients, particularly those who fail first-line therapies like continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

The study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 studies involving 261 patients with OSA and dentofacial deformities. The primary outcomes measured were changes in the Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI), Lowest Oxygen Saturation (LSAT), Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI), Epworth Sleep Scale (ESS), and Body Mass Index (BMI) before and after MMA surgery. The results showed significant improvements in all malocclusion classes, with Class I patients (no skeletal discrepancy) experiencing the highest reduction in AHI (89.61%). Class II patients, characterized by mandibular retrognathia, had worse baseline OSA severity but showed greater improvement in ODI compared to Class III patients (mandibular prognathia). Postoperative outcomes for ODI and ESS were comparable between Class II and III patients.

The study concludes that MMA surgery is effective across all malocclusion classes, with Class I patients benefiting the most in terms of AHI reduction. Subjective metrics like ESS were found to strongly predict objective OSA outcomes, suggesting their utility in clinical evaluations. The findings highlight the importance of considering OSA severity and hypoxemic burden, rather than just dentofacial deformity, when determining MMA candidacy. Limitations include variability in PSG criteria and the inability to match subjects by age, race, BMI, and gender. The study calls for further research, particularly on Class III malocclusion patients, to better understand surgical outcomes in this subgroup.

Overall, the research underscores the efficacy of MMA in improving OSA outcomes across different dentofacial deformities, providing valuable insights for clinicians in managing OSA patients.",18,3.4,18.01,,"You are sending messages too frequently, please wait deepseek ",93,95,10,100,85,88,15,95,88,90,12,100

The study comprised eight multiple-choice questions developed by five palliative care consultants via the Delphi method and distributed over three months. Alongside knowledge, perceived confidence, and exposure and training, shortfalls in palliative care management were assessed. A total of 50 eligible responses were collated from middle grade (n¬†=¬†34, 68%) and consultant (n¬†=¬†16, 32%) OMFS surgeons in the UK.

Only 10% had had palliative care rotations during their postgraduate training and the majority (86%) felt that further palliative care training should be incorporated into the OMFS curriculum. Our findings suggest a need for focused palliative care training and education amongst UK-based OMFS surgeons. A greater understanding through curriculum integration and a collaborative multidisciplinary approach will ultimately enhance the quality of care delivered to these patients.","Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with rising incidence and mortality. 1 In the UK alone, there are approximately 12,400 newly diagnosed head and neck cancer cases per year, accounting for 3% of all new cancer diagnoses. 2 With approximately 4100 deaths per year in the UK, this figure is expected to increase by a further 12% by the year 2040. 2

Patients may present with extensive morbidity that impacts basic human functions such as breathing, speech, and swallowing. 3 Since the vast majority of patients present with advanced disease (stages III and IV), palliative management becomes an integral consideration both in the short and long term. The core principle of palliative care involves minimising suffering, whether it is physical, psychological, spiritual, or social. It involves holistic care that aims to maintain comfort and dignity whilst enhancing quality of life.

Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach. Symptoms requiring specialist palliative care input may include pain, anxiety, bleeding, dysphagia, agitation, and dyspnoea, with simultaneous management of complex nutritional deficits. Identifying when a patient is suitable for palliation, knowledge of appropriate anticipatory medications, and being able to discuss and implement ‘do not attempt pulmonary resuscitation’ (DNACPR) decisions, are all vital. 3 Maintaining dignity whilst avoiding distressing and potentially inappropriate clinical interventions is paramount.

Head and neck oncology contributes substantially to the daily workload within oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS). Recognition and management of the dying patient is a crucial component of the Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme (ISCP) for OMFS. There is clear reference to the “assessment and control of distress in the dying patient in collaboration with a palliative care team” and the need for palliative intervention as key learning objectives. 4 Whilst curriculum objectives are important, however, most tangible understanding of palliative management arises from direct exposure, experience, training opportunities, and self-directed learning.

Daily review of head and neck cancer patients will invariably be the responsibility of the primary surgical team. Thus, even where specialist palliative care input is readily available, a working knowledge and appreciation of end-of-life care (EOLC) pathways is imperative. Moreover, due to the unprecedented disruption to oncological services in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, delayed cancer detection, and increased strain on palliative services, such confidence and knowledge is ever more essential.

Similar to the novel survey distributed amongst UK-based otolaryngologists, 5 this study aims to assess knowledge, decision-making, and perceived confidence in palliative care management amongst UK-based OMFS surgeons.

Material and methods
An anonymised 14-point online survey was distributed nationally amongst middle grade (ST3+ and SAS) and consultant OMFS surgeons over a three-month capture period, using email and social media platforms.

The surveys included eight scenario-based questions assessing knowledge, with a maximum score of 10. They were developed by a group of ENT surgeons and five palliative medicine consultants, focusing on a range of palliative care-based encounters involving head and neck cancer patients ( Table 1 ). Answers were confirmed through global consensus using a modified Delphi method.

The survey also collated data on the surgeon’s grade, deanery, and postgraduate palliative care training. Five-point Likert scales (1: strongly agree – 5: strongly disagree) were used to assess perceived confidence in the palliative care management of patients with head and neck cancers and whether participants felt further training in palliative care should be incorporated into the OMFS curriculum. Finally, participants were asked what modality of education delivery would be most useful.

Mean score of knowledge-based questions
The overall knowledge score on average was 3.2/10 (median (range) 3 (0–8) out of 10). The average score was 2.6/10 for consultants and 3.5/10 for middle grades.

Breakdown of knowledge-based questions
The results from our knowledge-based questions from Table 1 are illustrated in Figure 3 . The first question regarding end-of-life anticipatory medication prescribed in a HIV-positive patient with metastatic SCC of the oropharynx was correctly answered by 24 respondents (48%), who selected subcutaneous boluses of morphine, midazolam, cyclizine, and hyoscine.

Graphical presentation in numbers and percentages of the 50 responses received for the eight knowledge-based questions. Correct answers highlighted in green.
In the instance of first-line treatment for neuropathic pain in a patient with a metastatic adenoid cystic tumour, the largest proportion of respondents answered incorrectly with pregabalin (n = 22, 44%). On the question relating to DNACPR decision making, only 14 respondents (28%) selected both correct options of offering a second professional opinion and patient discussion. Regarding management of a catastrophic haemorrhage in a palliative head and neck cancer patient, 38% (n = 19) of those surveyed correctly identified intramuscular (IM) administration of midazolam as an immediate management strategy.

In the case of metastatic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, with rapid progression and tracheal involvement, a large cohort of respondents (n = 34, 68%) selected home discharge with palliative care support. A small cohort (n = 15, 30%) opted for tracheal stenting for symptomatic relief in conjunction with home discharge. A considerably lower number (n = 3, 6%) correctly identified both options.

In the instance of a significant bleed secondary to a patient with a recurrence of T4bN3M0 oropharyngeal malignancy, only 12 respondents (24%) correctly identified DNACPR, blood transfusion, and ward-based care with anticipatory medications.

In relation to lasting power of attorney (LPA), 20 respondents (40%) correctly identified the need for admission to the ward with best supportive care as per the daughter’s wishes (who retained a LPA). The majority (n = 25, 50%) selected admission with nebulised adrenaline, intravenous dexamethasone, and computed tomography (CT), which clearly constitutes invasive intervention, against the LPA’s wishes.

In the final scenario, the question describes a patient who developed multiple complications post tracheostomy for an advanced tongue-based SCC, including cerebral infarct, bleeding tumour, and chest sepsis ( Table 1 ). A total of 35 respondents (70%) correctly identified the need for a ceiling of care and shared decision-making with the patient.

Further training
The large majority of respondents (n = 42, 86%) validated the need for the formal integration of palliative care into the OMFS curriculum, with 4 (8%) disagreeing with such a notion, and 3 (6%) remaining neutral. When considering future educational modalities for the delivery of such content, 30 (60%) selected group sessions, 23 (46%) opted for simulation, 16 (32%) selected online modules, and 19 (38%) chose lecture-based teaching. Only 2% opted for direct experience through a placement within a palliative care setting.

Discussion
Palliative care management may be complex, but it is often an essential element of head and neck cancer management, involving a multidisciplinary approach to provide holistic supportive care. Head and neck cancer patients may be subject to significant morbidity, including malnutrition, dehydration, pain, adverse psychological impact, and catastrophic bleeding. Both outpatient and inpatient specialist input from the palliative care team ought to be sought promptly to optimise the management of complex needs. Pressures faced by the NHS in a post-COVID era has led to delayed diagnosis and treatment and, 67 whilst the full impact of this is yet to be appreciated in the short term, the clinical burden will invariably lead to further strain on already stretched specialist palliative care services. 8 The OMFS ISCP curriculum states that an understanding and knowledge of the medical and surgical management of palliative head and neck cancer patients and their complications are core competencies. 4 However, the coverage of palliative care management during specialty training is often sporadic and inconsistent, with clinicians relying mainly on principles and knowledge accrued during undergraduate training.

Our survey has demonstrated a lack of palliative care experience with only five respondents (10%) having undertaken a palliative care rotation during postgraduate training. There was a distinct lack of perceived confidence shown by the fact that only 14 respondents (28%) agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “I am confident in the palliative management of head and neck cancer”.

Proportionally, the perceived confidence findings are similar to those of ENT surgeons previously surveyed. However, in previous work, a smaller proportion of ENT surgeons had undertaken a postgraduate palliative care rotation (2.1%). 5

The survey adopted eight multiple-choice questions based on realistic and previously encountered patient scenarios. Thus, a working knowledge of fundamental palliative care management principles, as per the ISCP curriculum, was essential.

Anticipatory medications provide prompt and effective symptom control to reduce pain, agitation, breathlessness, nausea, vomiting, and respiratory secretions. In the UK, hospital guidelines suggest that these medications are given subcutaneously rather than intravenously (IV) or orally, as these can become both challenging and distressing for patients, particularly those with late-stage head and neck cancer. 9 Our first question showed that the majority of respondents correctly identified the subcutaneous route as the initial regime (n = 24, 48%). The second most popular answer (n = 19, 38%) indicated that a syringe driver would be beneficial. However, this would be the second option for continuous symptom control if the “as required” anticipatory medications were insufficient to meet the patient’s needs. 10 Typically, most patients have these initiated by junior team members or the palliative care team, so it is understandable that they might not recognise which subcutaneous form of analgesia delivery would be appropriate.

Two questions based around severe neuropathic pain and carotid haemorrhage aimed to assess knowledge of medication and dosage ( Table 1 questions 2 and 4). Question two responses indicated that the majority incorrectly answered pregabalin (n = 22, 44%) ( Fig. 3 ). Whilst both types of alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands, gabapentin and pregabalin, work effectively in managing neuropathic cancer pain and can be used interchangeably, the correct dosage option in the given scenario was gabapentin 300 mg once daily. 1112 Invasive head and neck malignancy can result in a catastrophic carotid haemorrhage, which may occur spontaneously with limited time to implement comfort-focused interventions. Intramuscular midazolam 10 mg, which was answered correctly by most, is recommended as the first-line intervention due to its rapid onset of action to alleviate anxiety. 13 Admittedly, this occurs rarely, but familiarity with the medication, route, and dose is crucial.

In relation to DNACPR, the legal framework and General Medical Council (GMC) guidelines are clear that the overall responsibility in DNACPR decision making ultimately belong to the clinician whilst taking into account the patient’s wishes and best interests. 14 A study by Perkins et al demonstrated wide variability in end-of-life care and expectations amongst different healthcare settings and patients. 15 The study suggested that lack of training, limited guidance from trust policies, and discomfort with having difficult discussions with patients, have led to negative impacts on patients’ quality of life and ineffective decisions about DNACPR. This strengthens the argument that a clear understanding of palliative care management amongst head and neck surgeons is imperative, given the need for decision making regarding resuscitation in a patient population that will inevitably have poor prognosis following cardiorespiratory arrest.

DNACPR decisions focus solely on cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of a cardiac or respiratory arrest, and are distinct from a ceiling of care or active treatment. The introduction of the ReSPECT (recommended summary plan for emergency care and treatment) form has integrated DNACPR decision making, appropriate interventions, and ceiling of care decisions in the context of the patient’s individual wishes and co-morbid status. 16 This upgrade in practice may be reflected in the responses we received. Forty respondents (80%) correctly acknowledged the need for decisions to be discussed with patients unless there was a clear risk of causing psychological harm (question 3 relating to DNACPR decision making). However, our sixth question involving a bleeding patient with HNSCC recurrence and low Hb ( Table 1 ) aimed to ascertain whether responses would take into account blood transfusion (ward-based intervention), which is a reasonable option alongside DNACPR, but was contrary to what the majority had answered (n = 26, 50%) ( Fig. 3 ). Not all hospitals have the ReSPECT form established in their trust, which may have affected the answers.

Interestingly, in relation to ceiling of care, our last question described a patient with advanced tongue cancer who suffered a stroke, had an infection, and was intermittently bleeding in the ITU following a tracheostomy. This question was answered most consistently with the majority of participants (70%) correctly selected a ceiling of care discussion and discontinuation of blood transfusions based on shared decision-making with the patient. Perhaps due to how often this scenario presents to surgeons following significant cancer progression and treatment, it is the most sensible and realistic answer.

Question five’s scenario explored end-of-life-care (EOLC) management in a young patient with rapidly progressive anaplastic thyroid cancer with tracheal involvement who later developed stridor ( Table 1 ). Whilst the majority of respondents (n = 34, 68%) recognised EOLC support at the patient’s home, only a small number (n = 15, 30%) correctly identified tracheal stenting despite an impending airway, with similar numbers incorrectly opting for tracheostomy (n = 13, 26%). The ENT cohort for this question showed 79.3% respondents discharging the patient home with palliative care support as per the patient’s wishes, 29.7% opting for tracheal stenting, and fewer choosing surgical tracheostomy (8.3%). 5 Tracheostomy has no place for this patient with advanced end-stage anaplastic thyroid cancer with significant airway involvement, but tracheal stenting can aid in the form of palliation. 17 In comparison with ENT surgeons, OMFS surgeons have traditionally had limited exposure to thyroid carcinoma pathology and surgery, so these numbers can be expected. 18

LPA is a legal framework that permits a patient-selected attorney to make best-interest decisions about their health, welfare, and finances when they lack the capacity to do so, and is underpinned by the Mental Health Act 2005. 19 This can be over-ridden if there is a concern about harm or not acting in the best interests of the patient. Question seven describes a patient with dementia whose daughter has a LPA for health and has declined invasive intervention for her father. Forty per cent opted for the most appropriate care, which included ward admission for best supportive care, accounting for the patient’s severe comorbidities. The majority (n = 25, 50%) surprisingly chose admission, intravenous fluids and cross-sectional imaging, despite the wishes of the daughter and an unlikely alteration in the clinical course.

Limitations
The survey was aimed at UK-based OMFS surgeons from ST3 through to consultant level, resulting in variable levels of experience and seniority amongst respondents. Self-reported surveys are at risk of selection bias and this may have affected our results when discussing previous palliative care training. A capture rate of 50/383 eligible responses based on NHS data remains a significant limitation, though this figure is higher than that reported in a previous otolaryngology survey. 20

Future work
Palliative care is complex and unique to each individual patient, however, our survey has identified significant deficits in the knowledge of OMFS participants. Studies have shown that palliative care workshops incorporating both education and simulation considerably improve learner attitudes and knowledge. 2122 Integrating palliative care training sessions in collaboration with palliative care colleagues would help to fulfil OMFS ISCP curriculum competencies, increase knowledge and confidence, and invariably improve the experience of patients during their end-of-life period.

Conclusion
Palliative care management is a challenging but vital component of advanced head and neck cancer management. Austerity within the healthcare system, combined with patient demographics has driven the need for clinicians to broaden their clinical exposure, a notion further consolidated following the COVID-19 pandemic, with increased stress on specialised services. Discrepancies in knowledge identified by our survey are likely not only to affect the perceived confidence of clinicians to manage such patients, but more importantly, a patient’s journey as they approach end-of-life care. The incorporation of immersive resources and collaborative educational modalities within the postgraduate curriculum of OMFS will, no doubt, serve to address such deficiencies and improve the overall experience of patients.

The study highlights that most patients present with advanced stages, making palliative interventions integral to preserving dignity and quality of life.

An anonymised 14-point online survey, distributed over three months via email and social media, targeted middle grade (ST3+ and SAS) and consultant OMFS surgeons. It comprised eight scenario-based multiple-choice questions designed by ENT surgeons and palliative care consultants, alongside demographic questions and self-assessment of palliative care confidence using a five-point Likert scale.

Fifty responses were analyzed. Notably, only 10% of participants had undertaken a postgraduate palliative care rotation, and just 28% felt confident in managing palliative care for head and neck cancer patients. The overall average knowledge score was 3.2 out of 10, with consultants scoring lower than middle-grade surgeons.

Patient reported outcome measures
In recent years there has been a trend in many areas of clinical study towards reporting Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs), using Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). 1 This has been driven by the need for a more holistic and rounded approach to the patient’s experience of health conditions. While there is a certain attraction to externally measurable parameters in science, these can be susceptible to observer bias, 2 and ultimately the most important outcomes in almost any area of healthcare provision are patient’s quality of life, which can be measured using PROMs. Another advantage of using PROMs in clinical study is that it keeps research and healthcare accountable to the public.

PROMs may be gathered using a range of standardised questionnaires, adapted to the area of study. One standardised questionnaire used in OMFS is the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QoL), which has been developed for use in measuring patient outcomes after treatment of head and neck cancer. 3 Other validated disease-specific questionnaires commonly used in OMFS include the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI), 4 and the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE). 5 Generic quality of life questionnaires used across a wide range of specialties include the EQ-5D, 6 the World Health Organisation Quality of Life (WHOQoL), and the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), 7 among many others.

In surgery, PROMs have already been used to evaluate interventions in areas as diverse as vascular surgery, 8 colorectal surgery, 9 gynaecology, 10 and gender reassignment. 11 According to a recent systematic review by Ologunde et al, most studies on trauma in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) do not use PROMs. 12 This systematic review found 416 English language papers involving PROMs in OMFS trauma, of which 21 met inclusion criteria (five randomised controlled trials and 16 cohort studies). The majority of these related to mandibular trauma, with few focusing on fractures of the facial bones. 12 One study by Conforte et al in 2016 compared Quality of Life measurements (using Oral Health Impact Questionnaire (OHIP-14) at three pre-determined time points) in 66 patients with facial fractures (including nasal, zygomatic, mandibular, Le Fort); 33 of these patients received some form of surgical intervention and 33 were treated conservatively. This study found positive outcomes following surgical intervention in comparison with conservative treatment, however it did not make comparisons between different surgical interventions. 13 In fact, to date there have been no dedicated studies to our knowledge that have compared quality of life measures after different surgical interventions for ZMC fractures. Our summary PROM results by domain of the UWQoL v4 are shown in Fig 1 and Fig 2 .

Management of zygomatic fractures
Zygomatomaxillary complex fracture is one of the most commonly treated facial fractures.

The indications for operative intervention in ZMC fractures are both functional and aesthetic. 14 The effects of displacement of segments of the ZMC include ocular and masticatory functions.

In terms of ocular sequelae, entrapment or retrobulbar haematoma constitute surgical emergencies that require urgent intervention. In most other cases, treatment can be delayed for one to two weeks while associated oedema resolves.

In this review we will compare two management options for zygoma fracture: ZMC open reduction-internal fixation (ORIF) and the Gillies lift.

ZMC ORIF involves an open surgical approach, allowing reduction of the comminuted segment of the ZMC and fixation using one or more plates, depending on the nature of the fracture. It is typical to use as few points of fixation as is necessary to achieve bony union. 14

The Gillies (temporal) approach, or Gillies lift, is an approach to surgical management of ZMC fractures which involves dissection inferiorly in a plane deep to the temporalis fascia, inserting an elevator deep to the depressed fragments of ZMC, and lifting and manipulating them until they are no longer displaced relative to the surrounding facial bones. 1516 Thus, the Gillies lift is a technique that involves reduction of a displaced fracture without fixation, while the ZMC ORIF is a procedure which involves both reduction and fixation.

The theoretical advantage of a Gillies lift over a ZMC ORIF is that it is a relatively simple and potentially less invasive procedure; minimal surgical access is needed, using a small temporal incision to gain access to the appropriate plane. ZMC ORIF may be required where there is fracture instability of a comminuted fracture.

Material and methods
PROMs were gathered systematically through the standardised domains included in The University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QoL v4), 17 which was adapted by the authors for appropriateness in facial injury by removal of the ‘Shoulder’ domain and substitution of the word ‘Cancer’ for the word ‘Trauma’. The UW-QoL was first introduced in 1993 by Hassan and Weymuller. 18 Version 4 was created in 2002 when Rogers et al included mood and anxiety ratings to the scale. 19 Guidance on scoring using the scale was published by Lowe and Rogers. 17

All questionnaire answers were collected in October 2021, with the time interval between operation date and the date of PROMs collection ranging from 6-41 months.

The inclusion criteria were defined as all patients who received treatment for zygomatic fractures in the OMFS department at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow from June 2018 to August 2021.

Using the inclusion criteria, PROMs were measured using the UW-QoL v4 which was adapted for use in facial injuries. Outcomes were measured in 11 domains: appearance, pain, saliva, swallowing, taste, chewing, anxiety, mood, recreation, activity, and speech.

The patients from both treatment groups were also invited to identify up to three domains from the UW-QoL v4 which they regarded to be the most subjectively important. Patients who received both surgical interventions were also asked to reflect on their decision to opt for surgery rather than a conservative approach.

Results
A total of 72 patients was identified as eligible. Thirty-eight did not respond and three were deceased by the time of data collection, leaving 31 patients whose data were analysed, all of whom were subject to surgical intervention (19 ORIF, 12 Gillies). Demographic data for the patients were as follows: 90% were male, with 10% female; 58% had a right-sided injury, while 42% were injured on the left; ages ranged from 24 to 69 with a mean age of 41.

PROMs data demonstrate that overall patient satisfaction across all domains is high (average 86.11), although average patient satisfaction is greater following ZMC ORIF (88.47) compared with Gillies lift only (83.75), where a score of 100 is maximum. However, average PROMs in both cohorts are notably poorer for domains of mood (70.07) and anxiety (60), when compared with average mood and anxiety scores in multiple validations of the UW-QOL in multiple disparate populations of head and neck cancer patients. 2021222324 In future studies, however, it would be beneficial to collect data for controls in the same population (i.e. healthy individuals residing in the West of Scotland) to enable more reliable interpretation of the implications of these mood and anxiety domain results. Ultimately, 96.77% of patients were satisfied with their decision to pursue surgical management versus conservative approach.

Discussion
Trends for interventional treatment in maxillofacial surgery have fluctuated over recent decades in the face of emerging evidence about rates of perioperative complications, radiological and examination findings, and recurrence of functional issues. 25 This study has underpinned the continued use of surgical intervention in zygomatic fractures, with favourable results for both ORIF and Gillies approaches.

The study’s limitations include a modest sample size, a restricted population and assessment of a limited number of interventions. The field would benefit from further large multi-centre studies involving the full range of potential management options for ZMC fractures. Additionally, the study is limited by the restraints of using clinical interactions to survey and follow up patients, making it difficult to clearly assess patients’ responses at pre-defined time points after surgery (such as six weeks, 12 weeks etc.). If several different time points were used and adhered to in the study it would provide more informative data, particularly regarding the mood and anxiety domains of the UW-QoL.

Another important limitation of the study is that the two approaches evaluated, Gillies lift and ORIF, have differences in their indications and application. In future, it would be useful to compare two different approaches to an open reduction, rather than an open reduction method with a closed reduction. However, in this population and this time period, there were not enough data to compare two different open approaches to ZMC surgery.

Prior studies in OMFS have used PROMs to show positive outcomes of surgery, compared with conservative approaches. 13 To our knowledge, this is the first study of PROMs to evaluate two different surgical interventions to treat ZMC fractures. We found positive outcomes of ORIF in comparison with Gillies lift in some domains (Pain, Activity, Recreation, Mood, and Anxiety) and positive outcomes of Gillies lift in others (Swallowing, Taste, and Saliva). Other domains were not substantially different between the two interventions. This study reinforces the benefits of surgical intervention for patients with ZMC fractures where patients are suitable for surgery, and the variance in results based on the domain of the UW-QoL also reinforces the role of patient choice and informed decision-making in OMFS, based on individual preferences. This supports a shift in culture of health services towards empowering patients rather than the traditional paternalistic model of clinicians making decisions on their behalf.

While there is a wealth of evidence that PROMs should constitute an important part of evidence-based medicine, it is worth noting a few potential challenges and limitations of their use.

One of the challenges of using PROMS in scientific study is that completion rates are highly dependent on the population studied. Age, functional status, cultural background, and literacy rates are likely to impact response rates which may limit the external validity of the study. Thus it is important to maximise all participants’ ability to respond adequately wherever possible, for example using pictorial aids in questionnaires and convenient ways for participants to submit responses. 1

Additionally, PROMs questionnaires may assess multiple overlapping constructs which can make it difficult to parse the results of the questionnaires. Furthermore, it is possible to have contradicting results of different PROMs questionnaires, for example when a generic PROM suggests increased quality of life but a disease-specific PROM suggests decreased quality of life. 1

This study highlights the frequently overlooked psychological impact of maxillofacial trauma since despite high levels of satisfaction with treatment and surgical outcomes, PROMs specific to mood and anxiety were notably poorer compared with the other domains assessed. Post-traumatic stress and anxiety is well recognised in major trauma patients and patients who have required admission to hospital, especially intensive care environments. 21 The inconsistency between psychological outcomes compared with surgical outcomes is not wholly surprising given that this cohort of OMFS patients will often have experienced assault or significant accidental injury which generates complex holistic care requirements. The results of this study prompt further investigation into whether outcomes in the OMFS community may be improved by psychological support provisions to optimise routine best practice and further the success of surgical management in attainment of maximal quality of life in this demographic.

The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital treats patients from across the West of Scotland, many from some of the most deprived areas according to the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2020, which measures local areas across seven domains: Income, Employment, Health, Education/Skills, Housing, Geographic Access, and Crime. In the SIMD 2020, the four most deprived postcode areas in Scotland were in the West of Scotland region, and three of those four were within the Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Health Board. 26 As patient reported outcomes are particularly susceptible to socioeconomic background of the participants, it would be advantageous to compare the results of future studies across different populations.

Conclusion
High patient satisfaction and quality of life measures after surgical intervention for zygoma and ZMC fractures provide evidence to support the continued implementation of surgical intervention in oral and maxillofacial trauma patients. However, further research is necessary to identify the reasons why the domains of mood and anxiety have much poorer PROMs than the other domains assessed in the UW-QoL. This differential outcome between domains of patient experience, and the particular role of anxiety and low mood, supports the provision of a clinical psychology service to improve holistic outcomes in this cohort of trauma patients. The increasing use of PROMs in evaluating various healthcare interventions may signify a break from paternalistic traditions in surgery and in the wider healthcare setting towards a more fulfilling patient-centric approach, improving both the patients’ experience and the OMFS trauma service as a whole.

PROMs, gathered via standardized questionnaires such as the modified University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire version 4 (UW-QoL v4), assess multiple domains including appearance, pain, chewing, mood, anxiety, and overall quality of life. The study compares two surgical management strategies for ZMC fractures: open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and the Gillies lift technique. ORIF involves an open surgical approach with plate fixation to stabilize displaced bone segments, while the Gillies lift employs a less invasive, closed reduction method without fixation.

Patients treated for ZMC fractures at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow between June 2018 and August 2021 were invited to participate. Data were collected from 31 respondents (19 ORIF; 12 Gillies) at intervals ranging from 6 to 41 months post-operation. Overall, patients reported high satisfaction with an average score of 86.11 out of 100, with slightly superior outcomes observed in the ORIF group. Notably, the domains of mood and anxiety scored lower compared to others, suggesting lingering psychological impacts despite successful surgical outcomes. Nearly all participants preferred surgical intervention over conservative management. The findings support the continued use of surgical techniques in managing ZMC fractures and emphasize the importance of integrating psychological support into trauma care to enhance holistic recovery and patient quality of life.

Sialoceles or salivary cysts are common complications following parotid tumour surgery. 1 A complication rate of approximately 3% to 7% has been reported in the retromandibular anterior transparotid (RAT/Innsbruck) approach for condylar fractures. 23 Aspiration and pressure dressing are the most common conservative treatments for sialocele. 4 However, it sometimes exhibits a refractory nature and induces sustained facial swelling.

Case report
A 69-year-old female was referred to our clinic because of an accidental fall. The patient showed malocclusion and trismus. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a right condylar base fracture with lateral displacement and dislocation ( Fig. 1 ). Internal fixation using the RAT/Innsbruck approach 2, 3 was performed. Osteosynthesis was performed on the condyle using two mini-plates on the ideal lines of osteosynthesis. After surgery, there was greater diffuse swelling in the right side of the face than the degree of expected general postoperative swelling. No facial palsy was observed. The swelling gradually became rounded, and a sialocele was suspected. Postoperative CT indicated good reduction and fixation and right diffuse facial swelling with obvious fluid storage ( Fig. 2 ). Laboratory tests revealed a high amylase level (643 U/L; normal range, 40–125 U/L). Aspiration of the buccal swelling was performed nine days after the surgery. A total of 9.5 ml yellowish serous fluid was obtained, and pressure dressings were applied. However, the rounded swelling recurred, and aspiration was performed six times over 19 days. The amount of aspirated fluid decreased to 3 ml at four weeks after surgery. Minocycline was administered after obtaining informed consent, including the off-label use of minocycline. Minocycline (100 mg/1V) was dissolved in 20 mL saline for injection. Aspiration of the buccal swelling was performed, and the same amount of minocycline as the amount of aspiration was immediately injected using a three-way stopcock ( Fig. 3 ). A three-way stopcock is a valve-like device consisting of a rotating handle and three ports. The two fluid flows could be easily changed by turning the handle. The patient experienced local pain at the injection site for approximately 10 minutes after the injection. The buccal swelling disappeared at five days’ follow up after the injection without complications, including facial palsy. No recurrence of buccal swelling was observed at ten months’ follow up.

Discussion
A sialocele is a well-known complication of parotidectomy. Britt et al have reported that 9.1% cases develop a salivary fistula/sialocele after parotidectomy, 96% of fistulas develop within one month, and all resolve within six months. 1 A previous study of ours showed that a salivary fistula was found in only one condyle (2.6%) after internal fixation using RAT/Innsbruck approach in 39 condylar fractures. 3

Although minocycline is a tetracycline class of antibiotics, various off-label uses have been reported in rheumatic and dermatological disorders. 5 Moreover, it is known to have high acidity and cytotoxicity, and promotes tissue adhesion. Therefore, minocycline has been used as sclerotherapy for simple renal cysts, 6 lymphocysts after pelvic lymphadenectomy, 7 thyroid cysts, 8 and hepatic cysts. 9 Transient local pain, 67 slight fever, 68 general malaise, 8 skin pigmentation, and drug-induced interstitial pneumonia 10 have been reported as complications. Iwai et al reported percutaneous injection with minocycline in four cases of salivary fistulas/sialoceles following parotidectomy. All cases were cured at around 12 days after injection, and the average dose of minocycline solution was 2.5 mL. Although one case showed temporary local pain, no major complication was observed, including facial palsy. 10

This case report has potential limitations. The sialocele had already reduced in size after six aspirations so it is possible that it was going to resolve anyway. Recurrent and late complications should be assessed by long-term follow up.

In conclusion, percutaneous injection with minocycline might be the first choice for postoperative refractory sialocele following condylar fracture when it has not been improved by aspiration and pressure dressing for more than two weeks. 4 However, further research recommendations could include more cases and injection of minocycline into larger sialoceles.

Conflict of interest
We have no conflicts of interest.","This research project presents a case report detailing the management of a refractory sialocele following condylar fracture surgery. Sialocele, a salivary cyst frequently encountered after parotid procedures, can occur in 3–7% of cases when using the retromandibular anterior transparotid (RAT/Innsbruck) approach. In this report, a 69-year-old female suffered a right condylar base fracture with lateral displacement after an accidental fall and underwent internal fixation using two mini-plates via the RAT/Innsbruck technique. Postoperatively, the patient developed an unexpected, diffuse facial swelling on the right side. Computed tomography confirmed fluid collection, and laboratory tests revealed an elevated amylase level, supporting the diagnosis of sialocele.

Conventional treatment with repeated aspiration and pressure dressings was attempted over 19 days but resulted in only a temporary reduction in swelling, with recurrent fluid accumulation noted despite a gradual decrease in the volume of aspirated fluid. Given the refractory nature of the sialocele, the treatment team opted for an off-label percutaneous injection of minocycline—a tetracycline antibiotic known for its high acidity and cytotoxicity, which promotes tissue adhesion and has been used in sclerotherapy for various cystic conditions. After obtaining informed consent, minocycline dissolved in saline was injected in an amount equal to the aspirated fluid volume using a three-way stopcock. The patient experienced brief local pain, and within five days the swelling resolved, with no recurrence observed at a ten-month follow-up.

The study concludes that minocycline injection may serve as a promising first-choice treatment for postoperative refractory sialocele when conservative measures have failed, while recommending further research with additional cases to validate these findings.","This case report explores a novel treatment for refractory sialoceles, a complication arising after parotid tumor surgery and, less commonly, following condylar fracture repair via the retromandibular anterior transparotid (RAT/Innsbruck) approach. The standard treatments, aspiration and pressure dressing, sometimes fail, leaving persistent swelling. This report details the case of a 69-year-old woman who developed a sialocele after condylar fracture fixation. Despite six aspirations, the sialocele recurred.

As a last resort, a minocycline injection directly into the sialocele was administered. This was based on prior findings of its effectiveness as a scelrosing agent in other cystic lesions. Following the injection, the sialocele resolved within five days, with no recurrence observed during a ten-month follow-up. The authors acknowledge a limitation: the sialocele might have resolved spontaneously due to prior aspirations. Despite this limitation, they suggest minocycline injection as a potential first-line treatment for refractory postoperative sialoceles after condylar fracture repair if aspiration fails for over two weeks. Larger studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of this approach.","This case report describes the successful management of a refractory sialocele (salivary cyst) following surgical treatment of a mandibular condylar fracture using the retromandibular anterior transparotid (RAT/Innsbruck) approach in a 69-year-old female. Sialoceles, a known complication of parotid surgery, typically present as facial swelling due to fluid accumulation and are often managed conservatively with aspiration and pressure dressings. However, in this case, the sialocele persisted despite six aspirations over 19 days, prompting the use of minocycline injection as an off-label treatment.

Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, was chosen for its sclerosing properties, which promote tissue adhesion and have been used in treating cysts and fistulas in other medical contexts. After obtaining informed consent, 100 mg of minocycline dissolved in saline was injected into the sialocele using a three-way stopcock following aspiration. The patient experienced transient local pain but showed complete resolution of the swelling within five days, with no recurrence at ten months post-treatment.

The report highlights minocycline injection as a potential first-line treatment for refractory sialoceles that do not respond to conventional methods. While the sialocele in this case was already reducing in size, the rapid resolution following minocycline injection suggests its efficacy. However, the authors acknowledge the need for further research, including larger case studies and long-term follow-up, to validate this approach and assess its applicability to larger sialoceles. This case underscores the importance of exploring alternative treatments for persistent postoperative complications in maxillofacial surgery.",6,3.3,14.5,,,92,94,10,100,83,86,20,100,88,90,10,100

We used computer-guided proportional condylectomy, which was conducted both through preauricular and intraoral approaches, then analysed the advantages and disadvantages of the two techniques. A computer-guided treatment algorithm is also presented. We enrolled 42 patients diagnosed with clinical asymmetry, with or without associated dentofacial deformities, which had been confirmed by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to be UCH. These patients underwent proportional condylectomy: 26 of them had isolated proportional condylectomy, while 16 had proportional condylectomy with concomitant orthognathic surgery. The intraoral approach demonstrated a capacity and precision that was nearly equivalent to the extraoral approach. This mitigates the significant surgical risks associated with the extraoral approach, but it is important to acknowledge the learning curve associated with the intraoral approach. Utilising virtual surgical planning (VSP) and custom cutting guides is essential.","Introduction
Unilateral condylar hyperactivity (UCH) is a pathological condition that results from an active overgrowth in one of the mandibular condyles. 1 It is also often incorrectly referred to as condylar hyperplasia (CH), which simply represents an enlargement of the condyle and refers only to its morphology, therefore, with no information about the metabolism of bone. This difference is not only a semantic difference, but an important practical one, as treatment of the condition is driven by the presence of condylar activity. 2 This is why the term UCH is used in this article instead of condylar hyperplasia. Obwegeser and Makek categorised UCH into three types: hemimandibular elongation (HE), hemimandibular hyperplasia (HH), and a hybrid form. 3 Wolford et al introduced a classification system for UCH that encompasses all conditions that result in excessive growth and enlargement of the mandibular condyle. 4 This classification subdivides UCH into four types: CH type 1 denotes accelerated and prolonged ‘normal’ growth; CH type 2 corresponds to osteochondroma; CH type 3 includes other types of benign condylar tumours; and CH type 4 includes malignant condylar tumours.

This abnormal non-neoplastic growth pattern causes one condyle to grow at a faster rate than the other, leading to facial asymmetry, jaw deviation, alterations in occlusion, and occasionally, pain and dysfunction. In the case of predominantly vertical defects, the patient will clinically present with: a rotated facial appearance; unilateral downward projection of the ascending ramus and angle; a tilted occlusal plane; open bite on the affected side; sharp kink of the mandible at the symphysis; tilting of the anterior teeth to the affected side; and lingual tilting of the lower dental arch on the contralateral side. In the case of horizontal deformities, the patient presents with a horizontal displacement of the mandible and chin to the unaffected side and contralateral displacement of the midline of the inferior interincisal line (which leads to crossbite on this side and no tilting of the occlusal plane). Hybrid forms often present with mixed symptoms of the vertical and horizontal forms. 3 Although the principles of vertical and horizontal growth are still valid, recent literature goes beyond this concept, with most cases growing diagonally. 5

Computed tomography (CT) is essential to gain a thorough understanding of the problem and to prepare a virtual surgical plan (VSP). Unfortunately, the CT scan does not provide information about the metabolic activity of the condyle. A significant role in the diagnosis of active disease is therefore played by nuclear medicine radiographic examination. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has emerged as one of the potential modalities for evaluating the presence of UCH, because it is a reliable indicator of bone activity levels. A discernible difference in scan uptake exceeding 10% between the left and right condylar regions in SPECT indicates an active phase of UCH, which suggests the need for surgical intervention. 2 Newer horizons in the literature tend to be more conservative by defining the threshold for condylectomy through serial SPECT scans, aiming to restrict indications to operate rather than using a single value of uptake difference as the only criterion. 6 The primary objective of treatment is to achieve facial symmetry, arrest growth, and preserve normal function.

Active disease requires condylar reduction, which is performed as either high condylectomy or proportional condylectomy. High condylectomy involves the removal of the upper 5 mm of the mandibular condyle, and it aims to eliminate the most active part of the condylar head, which drives the overgrowing process. Proportional condylectomy is a low condylectomy that resects the growth centre and decreases the posterior vertical excess, thus allowing the simultaneous correction of mandibular asymmetry. In our experience proportional condylectomy represents the best choice, especially if performed following a fully digital workflow as previously we have previously described. 7 Histopathological analysis of the affected condyle does not confirm or exclude UCH because, currently, there is no consensus in the literature concerning its histopathology. 18

After proportional condylectomy, a neocondyle forms within 12 months. Currently, computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology play a vital role in facilitating the planning of such surgeries. Additionally, to reduce operator-dependent errors and improve precision in translating VSP into the operating room, a three-dimensionally printed cutting guide can be manufactured to aid the surgical procedure. 9 Extraoral approaches, mainly preauricular, are commonly used by clinicians. The intraoral approach was first reported by Sear in 1972, but it was never widely adopted, because the preauricular approach was preferred by most surgeons. 10 Recently, however, the intraoral approach has been taken up by several clinicians, who have pointed out its advantages over the extraoral approach and thus contributed to its widespread use. 11 The aim of this paper is to present our clinic’s experience in treating UCH by proportional condylectomy conducted through preauricular and intraoral approaches, and conducting a comparative analysis of their respective advantages and disadvantages. An additional objective is to present a fully digital workflow, in which the VSP is fundamental.

Materials and methods
Patient population/study design
This is a retrospective, single institution, observational study conducted in the Department of maxillofacial surgery, Academic Hospital of Udine. Forty-two patients with clinical asymmetry (with or without associated dentofacial deformities) and imaging diagnosis (SPECT +) of UCH undergoing proportional condylectomy via preauricular or intraoral approach from January 2018 to January 2023 were enrolled. Twenty-six of them underwent isolated proportional condylectomy ( Table 1 ), while 16 underwent proportional condylectomy with concomitant orthognathic surgery because they presented with an associated dentofacial deformity ( Table 2 ). Patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics, type of associated dentofacial deformities, surgical approach, and sequence of the surgical procedures were registered and reported. All procedures were performed or supervised by two surgeons (SS and MR). Patients included in this study had completed a follow-up period of at least eighteen months, otherwise they were excluded from the study alongside patients with incongruous or missing clinical documentation. No other inclusion/exclusion criteria were established. This study complies with ethical guidelines reported in the Declaration of Helsinki and was granted the approval number IRB_45_2020 by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Udine.

Treatment algorithm
The protocol is summarised in Fig. 1 . It is crucial, preliminarily, to differentiate active and inactive disease to assign patients to either a preauricular or an intraoral approach to proportional condylectomy. The surgical approach was decided on the basis of the patient's clinical, intraoperative condylar subluxation/luxation capacity, the surgeon’s progressive familiarity with the intraoral technique, and other factors. Condylectomy can be performed as a single procedure in patients with no other associated dentofacial deformity. Patients with concomitant vertical or sagittal problems undergo computer guided proportional condylectomy and simultaneous orthognathic surgery in one stage. Orthognathic surgery is considered as the first procedure in cases of inactive disease (SPECT) or as a secondary procedure if patients are unsatisfied with the restoration of symmetry at one-year follow up after proportional condylectomy.

Imaging
Each of the patients included in the study underwent SPECT. In the report of each examination, the percentage of radiopharmaceutical uptake of each condyle was reported. In the presence of a difference in radiopharmaceutical uptake of 10% or more between the two condyles, a diagnosis of UCH was made. Furthermore, high-resolution CT was performed for all patients with the same protocol to allow VSP (T0): spatial matrix 512 × 512 px, slice thickness 0.625 mm, acquisition field from the vertex capitis to the lowest point of chin, posteriorly including both temporomandibular joints (TMJ), up to the mastoid tip.

Virtual surgical planning (VSP) and cutting guides design and manufacturing
DICOM data from the CT scan are imported in Mimics version 25 (Materialise) and processed to achieve a segmentation mask of reliable bony anatomy. The segmentation mask is yielded using a thresholding method for bone, in Hounsfield units, to conservatively include even tiny bony structures, including the whole surface of the condyle cortical layer. Two new masks are obtained from the segmentation mask, one for the skull and one for the mandible. Then the skull is aligned to the supraorbital, Frankfurt, and midcoronal planes to be oriented according to the natural head position. Maxillary and mandibular casts are imported and two composite models are created. A morphological analysis is performed to inspect the mandible, then the midsagittal plane is defined to mirror the healthy hemimandible. The mirrored mandible is aligned on the pathological mandible across the posterior vertical height and the osteotomy plane is defined to perform virtual condylectomy. The next step is the realignment of the mandible with rotation (fulcrum in the healthy TMJ) until the condylectomy side reaches the top of the hyperplastic condyle (to maintain the same interarticular relationship). Possible reshaping of the height of the plane of condylectomy is possible to achieve angular symmetry through a new condylectomy. To maintain the original articular space, the cortical profile of the hyperplastic condyle must coincide with that after condylectomy.

If simultaneous orthognathic surgery is to be performed, the VSP must include some additional steps:

1. Mandibular and maxillary osteotomies;
2. Plan the condylectomy;
3. Reposition the mandibular ramus after condylectomy in the correct interarticular relationship independently of orthognathic surgical planning. When repositioning the new condyle, the principle is the same: to maintain the correct joint space. In third classes without a planned mandibular advancement, a unilateral sagittal split osteotomy (SSO) can be planned because repositioning of the affected side ramus is possible without osteotomy. The extent of rotational compensation also plays a role in determining the need for a BSSO;
4. Occlusion registration: The occlusion is then recorded and aligned to the superior dental arch and then the mandible is repositioned into the desired surgical occlusion;
5. Reposition the skeletal base: The maxillomandibular complex is moved according to the desired orthognathic plan, correcting canting, yaw and pitch, and modifying sagittal and vertical dimensions;
6. Ancillary procedures for symmetry restoration: Residual asymmetry is corrected through ancillary procedures such as border recontouring and genioplasty;
7. Surgical guide modelling and 3D printing of surgical guides and plates: we then proceed to the surgical guides design for condylectomy and the plan is then shared with the manufacturer for the fabrication of custom implants and cutting guides.
The protocol of creation was similar for both the extraoral (condylar cap) and the intraoral surgical guide. First, the fitting surface of the guide is defined using brushing techniques: for the extraoral guide ( Fig. 2 ), the lateral condylar pole is highlighted, whereas for the intraoral guide, the condylar neck and part of the sigmoid notch continuing with the external oblique line. The marked surface is used as source to generate the main body of the guide in 3-matic software (Materialise). To the extraoral guide, a flange is added (that looks like a cap on the lateral condylar pole) and drives the curvilinear osteotomy just at the level defined by the VSP for proportional condylectomy. Subsequently, a guiding cylinder is positioned to enable the insertion of a screw to stabilise the guide at its recipient site. Concerning the intraoral guide ( Fig. 3 ), owing to the narrow space necessitated by this kind of access, it is generally not possible to stabilise this guide using a screw. To achieve stability, a meticulous definition of the undercut surfaces is performed to create a closely engaging guide, that can be positioned unambiguously and retain its position once in situ. The guide is then exported as STL file and 3D printed in resin or titanium.

Surgical technique
All procedures were conducted by the same surgical team under general anaesthesia and nasotracheal intubation. All patients were placed in supine position with a pillow under their shoulder. A prophylactic dose of antibiotics was administered. Patients underwent treatment involving either a preauricular or intraoral proportional condylectomy alone or combined with Le Fort I osteotomy and bilateral/unilateral sagittal split osteotomy of the ramus. If necessary, genioplasty and contour trimming were performed to enhance facial symmetry and achieve improved aesthetic outcomes.

Intraoral condylectomy ( Figs. 4, 5 )
To facilitate condylar translation, maximal mouth opening was induced, and a mouth gag was placed contralaterally to maintain the maximum mouth opening. The entire procedure was performed with endoscopic assistance (Karl Storz), which improved illumination and visualisation of the surgical field. Following the technique described by Hernandez-Alfaro et al, 11 a 2 cm vertical incision was made in the buccal mucosa along the anterior border of the mandibular ramus, extending approximately from the level of the mandibular second molar to the level of the maxillary teeth. Subperiosteal dissection was carried out cranially, elevating the buccal and lingual muco-periosteal flaps to expose the coronoid process and the sigmoid notch. The temporalis tendon was dissected from the anterior, lateral, and medial borders of the ramus up to its superior attachment on the coronoid process. Coronoidectomy was performed using a piezoelectric tool (Piezosurgery®, Mectron) to facilitate access to the condyle. Subperiosteal dissection along the condylar neck and head continued up to the inferior joint space, ensuring preservation of the disc. A screw was then placed at the level of the condylar head segment to be excised, to which a steel wire loop was attached as described by Li et al, 12 facilitating and securing the condylectomy. Subsequently, the customised cutting guide was positioned to ensure the correct level of the planned condylectomy. This is a critical moment because of its size and the need to ensure that it fits perfectly on the bone. The condylectomy was performed using the same piezoelectric handpiece, and the excised condylar fragment was safely removed by pulling the wire loop, carefully detaching it from temporomandibular ligaments and external pterygoid muscle insertions. Exploring the entire lower joint space from below allows for visualisation of the disk with its lower surface. Finally, the buccal mucosa was sutured with resorbable 3-0 polyglactin 910 (Vicryl Rapide, Ethicon).

Preauricular condylectomy
To reach the TMJ area, our clinic developed and still performs a modification of the preauricular subfascial approach 13 proposed by Al-Kayat and Bramley in 1979. 14 This surgical procedure provides an additional protective layer for the facial nerve (the deep layer of the deep temporal fascia and temporal fat pad) and has been called the deep subfascial approach.

A preauricular skin incision was created, extending into the temporal region, curving posteriorly and upwards beyond the primary branches of the temporal vessels. The temporal aspect of the incision followed a 45° angle to the zygomatic arch from the superior auriculocutaneous junction. The incision traversed through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial temporal fascia, and areolar fat tissue. Blunt dissection was carried out downwards until reaching a point 2 cm above the zygomatic arch, where the deep temporal fascia split into two layers containing adipose tissue. The surgical modification involved incising both the upper and lower layers of the deep temporal fascia, fully traversing the adipose tissue to expose the temporalis muscle fibres and establish a new subfascial layer below the deep temporal fascia. With access to this pocket, the periosteum of the zygomatic arch could be safely incised and rotated forward, facilitating a secure and comfortable approach to the joint capsule. Following incision of the capsule, the condylar head was exposed. A custom-made surgical cutting guide was positioned and secured with a screw. The condylar osteotomy was performed using a piezoelectric handpiece (Piezosurgery®, Mectron) equipped with a standard tip (MT1-10). Subsequently, the excised condylar fragment was removed, and the new condyle was superficially reshaped. Finally, the fascial layer was repositioned and sutured to cover the temporalis muscle, and the surgical access was closed with sutures.

Follow up and outcome evaluation
After the surgery, the patient was monitored in a recovery area until awake and stable. Pain medications, anti-inflammatory drugs, and antibiotics were administered to manage postoperative pain and prevent infections. To accelerate functional recovery and minimise the risk of joint ankylosis, active physiotherapy was initiated 3-4 days post-surgery. Postoperative treatment with elastic tractions and corrective orthodontics on brackets was deemed necessary for a time that varied from case to case. The patients were discharged after the surgery and follow-up clinical evaluation were scheduled 10 days, one month, and 12 months after surgery. Clinical signs were assessed and recorded. TMJ function was mainly assessed by measuring the maximum incisal opening (MIO), defined as the distance between the central incisors when the mouth is fully open, in addition to the assessment of lateral and protrusive movements. Each patient underwent a CT with the same parameters as the preoperative CT, in the immediate postoperative period, i.e. within 10 days after surgery (T1), and at one year after the procedure (T2). As stated earlier, postoperative CT scans were used to evaluate the formation and the adaptation of the neocondyle. If no problems were detected, the patients were then scheduled for an annual follow-up visit.

Results
Between January 2018 and January 2023, 42 patients with a clinical asymmetry (with or without associated dentofacial deformities) and imaging diagnosis (SPECT +) of UCH underwent proportional condylectomy, alone or in conjunction with orthognathic surgery, at our clinic. Table 3 (proportional condylectomy alone group) and Table 4 (proportional condylectomy and simultaneous orthognathic surgery group) shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, as well as the operative time, hospitalisation data, perioperative and postoperative complications, clinical results, and the accuracy of the remodelling of the neocondyle.

Proportional condylectomy group
The patients’ ages ranged from 12 to 48 years, with a median age of 22.7 years. A slight predominance of females was observed, with 14 female patients (53.8 %) and 12 male patients (46.2 %). All reported cases were classified as unilateral condylar hyperactivity (UCH), with equal involvement of both sides. Preauricular condylectomy was performed in 20 patients (76.9 %), while the intraoral approach was utilised in six (23.1 %). The mean operative time was 66.7 minutes, but these times were slightly shorter for cases treated via the intraoral approach when compared with the preauricular approach (55.8 versus 70 minutes). Duration of hospital stay ranged from one to four days, with a mean of 2.4 days overall (2.6 days for the preauricular group and 1.7 days for the intraoral group). Satisfactory clinical outcomes were reported in 22 cases, while four cases required subsequent delayed orthognathic surgery. One patient reported decreased maximum mouth opening and difficulty regaining proper function. Three postoperative complications were observed, two in the preauricular proportional condylectomy group (transient facial nerve palsy) and one in the intraoral proportional condylectomy group (intraoral access infection), all of which resolved without sequelae. Ultimately, no highly significant differences were identified between the two groups. Condylar remodelling was deemed radiologically satisfactory (overgrowth, abnormal/uncontrolled growth or bony remodelling) in 22 of the 26 cases (84.6 %). Further treatment, mostly elastic therapy and orthodontics was required for 23 patients (73 %), while three patients required no additional treatment .

Proportional condylectomy and simultaneous orthognathic surgery group
Patients’ ages ranged from 19 to 32 years, with a median of 25.2. A slight sex predominance was observed, with 10 female (62.5 %) and 6 male patients (37.5 %). All case reported were classified as UCH, with a small prevalence of the left side as the affected joint (62.5%) compared with the right side (37.5%). Proportional condylectomy was performed through a preauricular approach 10 times (62.5 %), while the intraoral procedure was performed in six patients (37.5 %). The average total operating time of the procedure was 194.7 minutes, a slightly shorter total time was notable in cases treated by the intraoral approach compared with the preauricular approach (183.3 versus 201.5 minutes). The mean condylectomy time in the preauricular group was 64.5 minutes, while in the intraoral group it was 55.8 minutes. Hospitalisation data range from three to five days showing a mean total hospital stay of 4.2 days (preauricular group 4.1 days; intraoral group 4.3 days). The clinical results were satisfactory in all 16 cases, as well as the restoration of function. Only two complications (infection of the mandibular approach) were observed in 16 patients, one in the preauricular and one in the intraoral approach groups. Condylar remodelling was defined as radiologically fine in 13 of the 16 cases (81.2 %), of which two cases belonged to the intraoral group and one to the preauricular group. All specimens underwent histopathological analysis, revealing a non-specific bony condition consistent with the clinical diagnosis of UCH. No other benign or malignant diseases were identified.

Comparison between intraoral and preauricular approaches
A further statistical analysis was performed regardless of whether orthognathic surgery was concomitant or not. The analysis of the time variable according to the Shapiro-Wilk test showed a normal distribution (p = 0.8766). A statistically significant difference in time was found using the two-sided Mann-Whitney U test CI 95% p = 0.0003. Concerning the variable number of days spent in hospital, using the Shapiro-Wilk test, the intraoral group had a normal distribution with p = 0.8789, but the Mann-Whitney test showed no statistically significant difference. Regarding the variable complications, Fisher's exact test showed no statistical significance for the incidence of complications between the two groups (p = 0.6134).

Discussion
As the literature reports, the treatment of UCH involves the use of extraoral and intraoral approaches, but there is a prevalence and preference for the extraoral approach. Of the extraoral approaches, the most commonly used is the pre-auricular approach. Sear reported the first example of intraoral condylectomy, but this has not been widely adopted until recently when it has been revived. 1011 In 1977 Eller et al also used this access for TMJ condylar osteochondroma resection. 15 Deng et al reported a modified transoral technique to access the mandibular condyle. 16 Endoscope-assisted conservative condylectomy in the treatment of condylar osteochondroma through an intraoral approach was described by Yu et al. 17 Hernandez-Alfaro et al reported their preliminary experience developing minimally invasive intraoral condylectomy. 11 Haas Junior et al evaluated the use of VSP and 3D-printed custom cutting guides combined with a minimally invasive transoral approach. 9 Karssemakers et al recently reported their experience of the treatment of 100 patients focusing on the surgical learning curve. 18 However, to our knowledge, no one has yet analysed and compared the intraoral with the preauricular approach. In our department, the treatment of facial asymmetries caused by UCH follows a very specific protocol (Material and Methods).

The preauricular approach, traditionally the most familiar to surgeons, provides extensive exposure of both the hard and soft tissue components of the TMJ, with the option of further extension to access adjacent anatomical structures. The conventional approach via the preauricular incision carries several potential complications, although the surgeon’s experience and the use of the deep subfascial approach minimise risks. Nonetheless, notable potential complications include visible facial scars, paresis of the temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve, and the development of salivary fistulae. 1920 Al-Moriassi et al reported in a systematic review that the risk of transient facial nerve injury varied from 0 to 26,1% and the incidence of permanent facial nerve injury was 1.4%-2.2%. 21 In this study we have not experienced permanent issues, reporting just two minor complications of transient facial nerve palsy amongst all the patients.

The alternative approach involves accessing the mandibular condyle intraorally. This method reduces the likelihood of neurovascular and salivary complications, eliminates the formation of facial scars, and maintains the integrity of the articular capsule, thereby lowering the risk of capsule scarring. 11 Some authors have reported that the intraoral approach provides an escalating risk of intraoperative injury to vital anatomical structures, including the internal carotid artery, the maxillary artery, the pterygoid plexus, and the skull base. 91722 None was reported in our series of patients. The primary complications are more likely to involve neuropathies of the trigeminal nerve, particularly affecting the inferior alveolar and buccal branches. These complications are typically transient and likely to have resulted from the dissection and manipulation of tissues containing the nerve bundles in the medial part of the joint. 18 In our opinion, another potential risk is infection of the surgical site because it creates a communication between the oral environment and the inferior joint space, and this occurred in one of the patients in our study ( Table 3 ). This is in contrast to Haas Junior et al, 9 who stated that the risk of infection may be reduced when the intraoral approach is combined with orthognathic surgery. A procedural challenge persisted due to inadequate intraoral visualisation of the condyle. Hence, endoscopic assistance and coronoidectomy were employed in all cases. Coronoidectomy facilitates full mouth opening and condylar translation by overcoming this anatomical obstacle. Some authors have reported that a coronoidectomy is not necessary to perform a proportional condylectomy, linking this to the surgeon’s experience with the procedure. 11 This could result in a further reduction in operating time. We note that coronoidectomy is mandatory to better visualise the surgical field in a proper manner, to allow the positioning of the cutting guide and to perform a safe condylectomy, especially in the medial part, which is the most difficult to reach and control. While spatial orientation and depth perception can be a challenge for less experienced surgeons, the use of an endoscope acts as an additional light source, improving illumination of the surgical field, providing magnified visualisation of the TMJ for the entire surgical team, and serving as a valuable adjunct. 17 This approach can be compared to an ‘arthroscopy of the lower joint space’. Haemorrhage within the surgical field was minimised through subperiosteal dissection and the use of electric coagulation, allowing for clear visualisation with the endoscope. Nonetheless, some reports suggest that direct visualisation from the surgeon’s intraoral perspective is adequate for the safe and accurate execution of the procedure. 11 Consequently, intraoral condylectomy requires meticulous precision and substantial surgical expertise, leading to heightened technical challenges and restriction of its widespread adoption. A learning curve is necessary to perform an intraoral condylectomy and reduce operative times. 18 In our opinion, intraoral condylectomy can be planned and performed, but there are requirements for the procedure to be performed safely. Firstly, the level of the condylectomy should not be very high. In these cases, the cutting guide should be placed inferiorly to perform the osteotomy superiorly. The second condition is that patients should have very good condylar motility, as the procedure is performed with the mouth open. The crucial point to make a patient a good candidate for an intraoral procedure is the clinical assessment of maximum mouth opening capacity because the anterior condyle translation facilitates the condylectomy. 11

Our study does not prove the superiority of one surgical technique over the other, so we cannot give clear guidance on which approach to use. What we can suggest is that a surgeon should be proficient in both techniques, and that the intraoral approach should be used whenever possible, as it is considered less invasive.

VSP has a very important role in our protocol together with manufacture of the cutting guide and customisation of the implants. 9 In fact, VSP and patient-specific cutting guides were developed to better transfer the VSP into the operating theatre, simplify the bone resection procedure, decrease possible errors, and reduce operating time. Moreover, cutting guides enhance the minimally invasive approach and enable more precise proportional condylectomy. Generally, virtual simulation of the ostectomy level and orientation, taking into account the underlying diagnosis and adjacent anatomical structures, assists the surgeon in individually and accurately anticipating each scenario. However, inaccuracies in the positioning of 3D-printed cutting guides may occur due to residual soft tissue between the mandible and the guide, as well as the shape of the patient-specific guide not being accurate enough. Additionally, discrepancies between the actual contour of the bone and the virtual model may arise if the CT threshold value chosen for mandibular reconstruction is too high or too low. This can lead to an imperfect fit of the cutting guide during surgery and reflect in the surgical outcome.

Conclusions
We believe that the intraoral approach has a capacity and precision that is almost comparable to the extraoral approach when performing a proportional condylectomy. It limits the major surgical risks associated with the extraoral approach and potentially offers less morbidity and shorter operative times and duration of hospital stay. However, there is a learning curve that needs to be taken into account. VSP and custom cutting guides are indispensable tools that greatly facilitate either intraoral or preauricular condylectomy. We need more studies to evaluate the use of the intraoral approach for condylectomies to assess its true benefits.

Granted the approval number IRB_45_2020 by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Udine. A written informed statement consent to report and publish their cases were obtained from the patients by the authors. All personal data have been obfuscated, and no specific reference can be traced back to identify the patients.","This study investigates the treatment of unilateral condylar hyperactivity (UCH), a condition characterized by pathological, asymmetrical overgrowth of one mandibular condyle leading to facial asymmetry, jaw deviation, and occlusal alterations. Distinguishing UCH from condylar hyperplasia, which merely reflects an increase in size without indicating active bone metabolism, the research focuses on the active disease that necessitates surgical intervention. Diagnosis is based on a combination of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) for anatomical assessment and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for evaluating condylar activity, with a radiopharmaceutical uptake difference of over 10% serving as the threshold for active disease.

The retrospective study, conducted at the Academic Hospital of Udine from January 2018 to January 2023, involved 42 patients. Twenty-six patients underwent isolated proportional condylectomy, while 16 received concomitant orthognathic surgery to address associated dentofacial deformities. Two surgical approaches were compared: the conventional extraoral preauricular approach and the emerging intraoral approach. Both techniques employ a fully digital workflow incorporating virtual surgical planning (VSP) and the use of patient-specific 3D-printed cutting guides, enhancing surgical precision and reducing operative time and error.

The intraoral method, assisted by endoscopy and routine coronoidectomy for improved access, offers the advantages of being less invasive and avoiding external scarring, though it requires a steeper learning curve and adequate mouth opening. Overall, both approaches yielded satisfactory functional and aesthetic outcomes with minimal complications. The study concludes that while neither technique is definitively superior, proficiency in both is recommended, and further research is needed to fully assess the intraoral approach’s benefits.","This retrospective study examines the treatment of unilateral condylar hyperactivity (UCH) through proportional condylectomy via preauricular or intraoral approaches. 42 patients with UCH underwent proportional condylectomy, alone or with orthognathic surgery, between 2018 and 2023. The study compares these two surgical approaches, evaluating operative time, hospital stay, clinical outcomes, complications, and condylar remodeling. Virtual surgical planning (VSP) was a key component of the procedure, utilizing 3D-printed cutting guides.

The results showed a significant time reduction with the intraoral approach. In contrast, the preauricular approach offers greater precision. No significant differences were noted in the number of days spent in hospital, the incidence of complications, and condylar remodeling between the two approaches. The authors conclude that the intraoral approach is comparable to the preauricular approach, potentially offering less morbidity and shorter operative times, but requires a learning curve. They advocate for surgeons to be proficient in both techniques and to utilize VSP.","This research paper evaluates the treatment of Unilateral Condylar Hyperactivity (UCH), a condition causing abnormal growth of one mandibular condyle, leading to facial asymmetry and functional issues. The study compares two surgical approaches for proportional condylectomy—preauricular (extraoral) and intraoral—in 42 patients treated at the Academic Hospital of Udine between 2018 and 2023. UCH was diagnosed using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and treated with either isolated condylectomy or combined orthognathic surgery, depending on the presence of associated dentofacial deformities. Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP) and 3D-printed cutting guides were used to enhance precision.

Results showed that both approaches achieved satisfactory outcomes, with the intraoral approach offering shorter operative times (55.8 vs. 70 minutes) and reduced hospital stays (1.7 vs. 2.6 days) compared to the preauricular approach. Complications were minimal, with transient facial nerve palsy in two preauricular cases and one intraoral infection. Condylar remodeling was successful in 84.6% of isolated condylectomy cases and 81.2% of combined orthognathic cases. The intraoral approach, though technically challenging, reduced risks of facial scarring and neurovascular complications but required endoscopic assistance and coronoidectomy for optimal visualization.

The study concludes that the intraoral approach is a viable, less invasive alternative to the preauricular approach, particularly for patients with good condylar mobility. However, proficiency in both techniques is recommended, and further research is needed to validate the intraoral approach's benefits.

In this study, we aimed to understand the impact of delayed versus immediate dental implant placement. A cross-sectional and prospective study was conducted including patients who underwent reconstruction of the mandible via osseous vascularised bone flaps and dental implants. The FACE-Q Head and Neck Cancer module and the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory and Speech Handicap Index were used to evaluate HRQOL. A total of 187 implants were placed in 52 patients, of which 44 patients (85%) completed questionnaires.

Dentoalveolar rehabilitation through the placement of immediate dental implants at the time of surgery was found to be associated with higher HRQOL scores related to appearance, eating and drinking, oral competence, and smile.","Introduction
Segmental resection of the mandible is frequently required for the treatment of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) along with other locally invasive tumours and osteoradionecrosis (ORN).1 Contemporary reconstruction of the defect typically involves an osseous free flap. These reconstructions are complex due to the unique shape and movement of the mandible as well as the load bearing forces applied during mastication. Osseointegrated implants can be placed into bone flaps to support a dental prosthesis that assists mastication, speech, and aesthetics.2
Previous work has established that patients undergoing mandibulectomy experience worse speech,3 decreased biting force, the need for texture modification, poor oromotor function,4 and unfavourable changes to the contour of the face.5 These functional and aesthetic problems can impair communication and swallowing, leading to malnutrition6 and social isolation.7 Petrovic et al concluded that dental rehabilitation is key to restoring health related quality of life (HRQOL) following the ablative procedure.8 This is supported by a virtual surgical planning prior study at our institution, which found that dental rehabilitation and virtual surgical planning (VSP) positively correlate with higher HRQOL domains related to eating and drinking, smiling, and speaking in maxillectomy patients.9
The aim of this study was to help understand the impact of immediate versus delayed dental implantation in mandibular reconstruction on HRQOL specifically in relation to speech and swallowing. The study hypothesis was that delaying the placement of osseointegrated dental implants is associated with inferior functional and HRQOL outcomes. The results of this study will assist clinicians in better providing informed consent, especially to patients who are uncertain about the benefits of incorporating dental implants into their primary reconstruction. There is remarkably little published evidence on this topic because only a minority of patients undergoing mandibular reconstruction received dental implantation and very few units maintain prospective HRQOL data.
Methods
The study was granted ethical approval from the St Vincent's Health Network; St Vincent's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (Protocol No. 2020/ETH02415). Under the study, the Integrated Prosthetics and Reconstruction (IPR) service at Chris O’Brien Lifehouse (COBLH), Sydney, Australia prospectively maintains a jaw reconstruction database which collects clinical, pathological, HRQOL and functional outcomes on all patients who have undergone mandibulectomy or maxillectomy. The database was constructed in 2020 and contains retrospective data on 267 patients treated at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital or COBLH from 13/02/2011 to 06/12/2020 and prospective data on 85 patients from 16/12/2020 to 19/01/2022. The principal difference between cohorts was the presence of baseline data for the prospective cohort. The inclusion criteria for this study were all patients who underwent mandibular resection from 2011-2021 and had vascularised free bone flaps using occlusal-based VSP and dental implant placement. Patients were excluded where HRQOL data could not be obtained. Patients were categorised into immediate dental implant placement (at the time of osseous reconstruction) or delayed implant placement groups. In the prospective cohort, all participants were considered for immediate dental implants. Patients are always advised of the associated costs and requirements for maintenance of implant hygiene, potential complications, and additional procedures required. After informed consent, all patients are given the option to proceed with immediate implant placement if there is sufficient time to allow for planning.
The selection criteria for implant placement and dental restoration were the same for the delayed and immediate implant groups. Exclusion criteria for immediate dental implants were cognitive impairment or reconstructions where it is unlikely that dental implants would be utilised, such as severe trismus, microstomia, or lack of vestibule. Most patients received implant-supported fixed dental prosthesis restoring back to the first molar. However, in patients where baseline oral hygiene was inadequate or where cancer surveillance would be impaired by a fixed prosthesis, an implant supported removable prosthesis was used. Study covariates including gender, age, radiation (yes/no), cancer (yes/no), and time post-surgery were extracted for covariate analysis. Occlusal based virtual surgical planning was performed according to a published protocol.10
Outcome measures
Participants were asked to complete three patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) validated for patients who have been diagnosed with head and neck neoplasia. They were invited to participate either online or by hard copy posted questionnaires. The FACE Q Head and Neck Cancer Module (FACE Q)11 consists of 14 sub-scales which total 102 questions exploring the patient’s experience of swallowing, speech, salivation, eating and drinking, appearance, cancer worry, and satisfaction with information. Each question offers between three and five responses to select from, where a lower score denotes poorer function, except for cancer worry, and a lower score denotes a better outcome. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability for the FACE Q is strong, with the Cronbach’s alpha (α) > 0.9 for 11 of the 14 scales and interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) ranging from 0.86 to 0.98. The MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI)12 is a dysphagia-specific PROM used to measure functional, emotional and physical aspects of swallowing function consisting of 20 items scored on a scale of 1 to 5. Like FACE Q, a higher score denotes better function with high internal consistency and (α = 0.85 - 0.93), and test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.69 - 0.88). The Speech Handicap Index (SHI)13 is a 30-item PROM which examines functional and psychosocial speech ability. Each score is rated from 1 to 5, and a total score calculated with a higher score indicating worse function/outcome. Total SHI has high internal consistency (α = 0.98) and test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.89).
Statistical analysis
Patient demographics, presenting pathologies and surgical outcomes were exported from a secure Sydney Local Health District REDCap database for analysis in the system software R i386 3.2.2 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographics and clinical details of the participants. Differences in FACE Q, MDADI, and SHI outcomes from the combined retrospective and prospective cohort were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) linear regression with 95% confidence intervals. A multivariate Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE) was then applied to the prospective group to allow for correlated longitudinal data adjusting for age, a diagnosis of cancer, baseline effect, and implant timing (immediate versus delayed). There were three participants in the prospective cohort with missing baseline data who were excluded for this analysis.
Results
Clinicopathological characteristics
In total, 52 patients who underwent ablation and reconstruction of the mandible with osseous free flaps with either immediate or delayed dental implants had HRQOL questionnaires sent to them, of which eight patients declined to participate (response rate of 85%). The clinicopathological characteristics of patients included within the study are presented in Table 1. Of the 44 participants, 23 completed the surveys prospectively at baseline, three-months, six-months, and 12-months following surgery and 21 completed the cross-sectional survey. There were 20 males and 24 females with a mean age at the time of operation of 55 years. Common pathologies treated were OSCC (n = 13), ameloblastoma (n = 10), ORN (n = 8), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (n = 3).

Surgical reconstruction and dentoalveolar rehabilitation
The most common free flap donor site was the fibula (n = 38, 86%), followed by the iliac crest (n = 5, 11%) and the scapula (n = 1, 2%). Postoperative (adjuvant) radiotherapy was required in 13 patients (30%) and 10 patients (23%) had radiotherapy prior to their reconstruction. A conventional or implant-supported prosthesis was fitted for all patients (n = 44, 100%) during the study period. The majority (n = 36, 82%) had implants placed immediately, with the remaining (n = 8, 18%) having delayed implants placed at a median time of 546 days postoperatively. A summary of patient demographics can be found in Table 1.

GEE was looking at immediate versus delayed implants. For each module of the FACEQ, the coefficient is the estimate of the anticipated difference between immediate implant would score compared to those with delayed implants. IE. the difference in appearance on the face q is anticipated to be 21.8 (+/= CI). We used GEEs to manage the missing data as well as account for baseline and longitudinal follow up.

Prospective cohort
GEE analysis identified several statistically significant relationships between selected variables and HRQOL measures. Immediate placement of dental implants was associated with superior FACE-Q appearance (p < 0.001, b = +41.3), satisfaction with information (p < 0.001, b = +27.2), and swallow (p = 0.05, b = +31.6) scores. These differences approached significance for oral competence (p = 0.06, b = +34.5) and speech (p = 0.06, b = +30.9). Other significant covariates included a cancer diagnosis, which was associated with significantly poorer FACE-Q saliva (p = 0.004, b = -16.7), drooling distress (p = 0.03, b = -13.4), smile (p = 0.02, b = -18.6), smile distress (p < 0.001, b = -24.5), speech (p = 0.03, b = -21.5), and cancer worry (p = 0.001, b = -19.4), and MDADI Global score (p = 0.04, b = -12.7). Increased age predicted worse satisfaction with information (p = 0.01, b = -0.51 per year).
Discussion
This is the first study to assess the effect of dental implantation timing on HRQOL and function in patients undergoing mandibular reconstruction using the FACE-Q scale. We have shown that immediate dental implant placement is associated with higher HRQOL in the domains of appearance, eating and drinking, oral competence, smile, appearance distress, drooling distress, eating distress, smile distress, cancer worry, and satisfaction with information.
HRQOL is one of many competing priorities in mandibular reconstruction.14 Surgeons performing immediate implant placement should be aware of the potential negative associations as well, including increased operative time and complications.15 Implant placement often requires periosteal stripping and additional manipulation of the bone flap, which may lead to partial flap necrosis. Irawati et al found an 11% increase in postoperative complications per hour of additional operative time beyond nine hours in patients undergoing microvascular free flap surgery for reconstruction of head and neck defects.16 Furthermore, the placement of dental implants primarily requires the use of virtual surgical planning, which has significant cost implications for units performing high volumes of mandibular reconstruction.17
Several authors have highlighted the improved HRQOL reported by patients following immediate implantation in the native mandible.18, 19, 20 The use of immediate dental implants accelerates time to dental rehabilitation and increases implant survival rates, which is especially important in the oncological patient requiring postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy.21, 22 Patients who had immediate implants reported higher scores in multiple FACE-Q domains including appearance (+21.8, p = 0.02), smile (+21.9, p = 0.03), oral competence (+24.6, p = 0.004), and satisfaction with information (+24.6, p = 0.004). We suspect that the HRQOL difference reflects irreversible soft tissue contracture leading to loss of vestibular sulcus and lack of lip support. Delays in functional rehabilitation are important not only for the 66% of patients treated for oral cancer who survive past the five-year mark, but also to those who succumb to their disease beforehand.23
There are several potential confounders in this study including diagnosis, age, and radiotherapy. In oncological diseases where life expectancy is low and treatment seldom offers complete recovery, HRQOL has become an important outcome measure.24, 25 In this series of mandible reconstructions, a head and neck cancer diagnosis was associated with lower FACE-Q saliva (-16.67, p = 0.004), smile (-18.58, p = 0.02), speech (-21.54, p = 0.03), smile distress (-24.45, p < 0.001), and MDADI Global scores (-12.68, p = 0.04). Our results report worse scores on satisfaction with information (-0.51, p = 0.01) with increasing age, concurrent with quality and quantity of bone determining implant success.26 Whilst this may be less relevant in reconstructed mandibles, the adjacent mandibular and opposing maxillary bone may limit the range of prosthodontic options available to comprehensively rehabilitate the oral cavity.27 The use of adjuvant radiotherapy following ablation and reconstruction of the mandible is common and was employed in 53% of our patients. As several patients also had preoperative radiotherapy, heterogeneity may have rendered the effect of radiotherapy statistically insignificant. However, a recent study on patients who undergoing jaw reconstruction highlights the major impact that radiotherapy has on HRQOL and speech and swallowing function.28
Limitations
The retrospective and cross-sectional nature of this study makes gathering HRQOL data prior to and following mandible reconstruction and dental rehabilitation challenging. Importantly, the heterogeneity and small sample size of our study limited our ability to make comparisons between groups and draw strong conclusions. Hence, care should be taken when translating the results demonstrated here to other institutions performing lower volumes of complex cancer reconstructions or not routinely utilising VSP as shown in Figure 1. Petrides et al previously found that VSP was associated with significant improvements in salivation, smiling, swallowing, drooling distress, eating distress, smiling distress, speaking distress FACE-Q scores and all MDADI scores.9 Additionally, due to changes in practice, there is a greater number of patients who had immediate compared with delayed implantation. We and other groups have demonstrated that the number of patients who receive dental implants and dental rehabilitation is far smaller when dental implants are placed secondarily.29, 30 Hence, despite no intentional selection bias, disease related biases such as radiotherapy and survival still prevail. Multicentre studies investigating the impacts of dentoalveolar rehabilitation on HRQOL outcomes in a variety of different contexts are required to determine whether out findings are reproducible.

Conclusion
Placement of dental implants into vascularised bone flaps at the time of primary resection and reconstruction is an evolving paradigm and where possible, immediate implantation may give better results than delayed implantation. Dental rehabilitation using immediately placed implants is associated with improved patient reported appearance, oral competence, eating and drinking, smile, smile distress, speaking distress, appearance distress, drooling distress, eating distress, cancer worry, and satisfaction with information function. Education on the rehabilitative options and their impact on mandibular function, time to rehabilitation, financial implications and adjuvant procedures will support patient decision-making.

This research project evaluates the impact of immediate versus delayed placement of osseointegrated dental implants during mandibular reconstruction on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), with a focus on speech and swallowing functions.

Using osseous free flaps and occlusal-based virtual surgical planning, patients undergoing segmental mandibulectomy received either immediate or delayed implant placement. The study hypothesized that postponing implant placement leads to inferior functional and HRQOL outcomes compared to immediate implantation.

Data were collected prospectively and retrospectively from a jaw reconstruction database at Chris O’Brien Lifehouse, Sydney, spanning 2011 to 2022, with 44 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. Patient outcomes were measured using validated patient-reported outcome measures including the FACE-Q Head and Neck Cancer Module, the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory, and the Speech Handicap Index. Statistical analyses using ANCOVA and Generalised Estimating Equations demonstrated that immediate dental implantation was associated with significantly improved HRQOL scores in domains such as appearance, oral competence, eating and drinking, and distress related to appearance, smile, and speech. Conversely, delayed implantation correlated with poorer outcomes in these areas.

The findings support immediate implant placement as a viable strategy to enhance functional rehabilitation and quality of life in mandibular reconstruction. Limitations include sample heterogeneity and retrospective data constraints, suggesting that further multicentre studies are needed to confirm these results and inform clinical decision-making regarding dental rehabilitation strategies. Findings may guide future improvements in patient care.","This study investigates the impact of immediate versus delayed dental implant placement during mandibular reconstruction on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL). The study hypothesizes that delaying implant placement negatively affects functional and HRQOL outcomes. Researchers prospectively and retrospectively analyzed data from patients undergoing mandibulectomy and vascularized free bone flap reconstruction with dental implants, comparing immediate and delayed implant groups.

Using validated questionnaires (FACE-Q, MDADI, SHI), they assessed speech, swallowing, and other HRQOL aspects. Results showed that immediate implant placement was associated with significantly better outcomes in multiple FACE-Q domains, including appearance, eating and drinking, oral competence, and satisfaction with information. While cancer diagnosis negatively impacted several HRQOL measures, immediate implants still demonstrated a positive effect on HRQOL in the prospective cohort. The authors conclude that immediate implant placement improves HRQOL in patients undergoing mandibular reconstruction and that education on the rehabilitative options will support patient decision-making.","This study investigates the impact of immediate versus delayed dental implant placement on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients undergoing mandibular reconstruction with osseous free flaps. Conducted at Chris O’Brien Lifehouse, Sydney, the research involved 44 patients (36 immediate, 8 delayed implants) who completed validated HRQOL questionnaires (FACE-Q, MDADI, SHI). Immediate implant placement was associated with significantly better outcomes in appearance, eating, oral competence, smile, and satisfaction with information (p < 0.05). Patients with immediate implants also reported less distress related to appearance, drooling, and eating, alongside reduced cancer worry. The study highlights the benefits of immediate dental rehabilitation, which may mitigate soft tissue contracture and improve functional and aesthetic outcomes. However, immediate implantation carries risks, including increased operative time and potential complications. The study acknowledges limitations, such as its retrospective design, small sample size, and heterogeneity in patient diagnoses and treatments. Despite these limitations, the findings suggest that immediate dental implants enhance HRQOL, particularly in cancer patients, and support the use of virtual surgical planning (VSP) for optimal outcomes. The study underscores the importance of patient education on rehabilitation options and their implications for function, cost, and recovery time.

Corrective jaw surgery is a well-established treatment in patients with dentofacial anomalies or sleep apnoea. 1 Pseudarthrosis and osseous non-union are potential complications in osseous healing that can compromise the treatment outcome, and their clinical and economic impact is relevant due to the need for revision surgeries. 234 The rate of osseous non-union is relatively high in mandibular reconstruction, around 24%–45% 56 ; in mandibular fracture treatment it is lower, at around 1%–2%. 789 When bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) is part of mandibular displacement in orthognathic surgery, pseudarthrosis is usually rare. In a retrospective study of 5025 cases it was detected in only 0.2% of the patients. 10 A limited number of reports about pseudarthrosis following BSSO can be found in the literature. 1112 Previous studies have reported detecting it clinically when it became symptomatic, so minor extents or clinically uneventful osseous non-union has not been detected, resulting in uncertainty regarding the actual rates of bony healing. A biomechanical stable fusion of the osteotomy site is relevant for the safe removal of plates during the postoperative course, and is performed in about a quarter of patients. 13

The actual reasons for the development of pseudarthrosis of the mandible mostly remain unclear. In mandibular reconstruction, higher rates of non-union have been associated with unfavourable biomechanics and biological factors such as radiotherapy. 5614 In mandibular fractures, male sex, fractures in the tooth-bearing part of the mandible and a history of substance abuse have been associated with impaired bone healing. However, specific risk factors for impaired bone healing following BSSO have not yet been described. 15 Especially in elective orthognathic surgery, including BSSO, complications should be reduced to the absolute minimum to justify the indication for surgery. However, the highly standardised setting of BSSO and the expected high compliance of patients offer a solid basis on which to assess osseous healing at the BSSO site. Analysing osseous non-union in these patients may also support research on risk factors for diminished osseous healing of the mandible and improve the treatment quality of orthognathic surgery in the future.

Based on an objective volumetric assessment methodology to determine the quantity of osseous healing, we aimed to assess osseous healing in patients who underwent BSSO of the mandible, and to identify further risk factors for impaired bony healing. 14

Patients and methods
Ethics
This prospective study was carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from each patient. The institutional review board of Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin granted permission for data collection and publication (EA2/107/20).

Study design
This prospective study analysed bony healing after mandibular displacement in patients treated by orthognathic surgery from September 2020 to December 2022 at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery of Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. All patients over the age of 18 years with a dentofacial anomaly who were capable of giving consent, and who underwent elective surgical jaw displacement in one (mandible) or both jaws (mandible and maxilla), were included. For correction of the mandible, only the BSSO technique based on the approach by Epker was used. 16 Hand-bent titanium miniplates 1 mm thick (Gebrüder Martin GmbH & Co) were used for internal fixation. Pregnant patients were excluded from the study. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was used for preoperative and postoperative imaging. Patients who requested postoperative plate removal during follow up received additional imaging as part of the clinical routine. Only patients who underwent a CBCT immediately after surgery (baseline) and a second CBCT at least six months later (follow up) were included. All CBCT scans were performed with the same device (MedSeries H23, Sophisticated Computertomographic Solutions GmbH) with an isotropic voxel edge length of 0.2–0.4 mm in all directions.

Assessment of gap volume and width after BSSO
The method used in this study to determine the volume and width of the gap has been described previously. 14 In brief, to determine total volume (TV) change, the volume and width of the cortical bone gap were analysed separately for both sides of the mandible, and for the buccal and lingual regions, resulting in four different gap sides per patient ( Fig. 1 ).

Fig. 1
Demonstration of the workflow. Following mandibular displacement surgery, baseline and follow-up cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed for each patient. Bone volume changes over time were analysed for both the lingual and buccal cortical gap of the left and right sides of the mandible in each patient.
The area of cancellous bone in the osteotomy gap was not considered in the analysis. Digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) files of the CBCT scans were imported into ImageJ (ImageJ for Java 8, version 1.53f, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The cortical osteotomy gap was defined manually every three slices using the ‘freehand selection’ tool by an individual observer (author RB). The remaining slices between the manually determined slices were automatically interpolated by the software. In cases of artefacts or a small gap width, the examiner adapted the individual slice. Subsequently the TV in mm 3 was calculated.

Changes in TV between baseline and follow-up CBCT were calculated with regard to volume change. Complete ossification was defined as a TV of 0 mm 3 , hence a 100% volume change and non-union were indicated as a 0% volume change. Partial ossification of the osteotomy gap was defined for values between 0% and 100%. In addition, to identify the mean values of the initial width of the osteotomy gap, the cortical distance was measured at the most cranial, most caudal, and central slices of the buccal and lingual gaps using the software measuring tool.

Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism version 9.2.0 (GraphPad Software) was used for data collection.

All analyses were conducted with R version 4.2.1. 17 First, the initial gap width and volume change were compared descriptively based on the mean and standard deviation (SD). P values were derived from univariate linear mixed models accounting for repeated measurements from the same subject. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relation between the initial gap width and the volume difference (baseline CBCT – follow-up CBCT) as a percentage. Finally, a multiple linear mixed model was established. The outcome parameter was the percentage volume difference with the following covariates: the initial gap width, sex, age, aetiology (dentofacial deformity or obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)), side (left or right), and location (buccal or lingual). Due to the exploratory nature of the study there was no adjustment for multiplicity, so the p values should be interpreted as exploratory (hypothesis-generating).

Results
We screened 52 patients for this study. Of them, 36 (23 men and 13 women) met the inclusion criteria. The main indication for orthognathic surgery was dentofacial deformity (angle classes II and III, n = 27) or OSA (n = 9). Table 1 shows the patients’ characteristics.

No major wound healing disturbances or pseudarthrosis/non-union were noted clinically. On average, for each osteotomy gap, 81 slices for baseline CBCT and 18 slices in the follow-up scans were analysed depending on mandibular height, gap orientation, and bony healing. In total, 144 gap sides were analysed.

On average, the baseline CBCT showed that the width of the initial osteotomy gap on the buccal side was larger (4.80 ±2.62 mm) than the lingual gap (4.29 ±2.45 mm ( p = 0.02). It also showed a trend to be larger on the left side (4.73 ±2.42 mm) of the mandible than the right (4.35 ±2.66 mm) ( p = 0.09).

We analysed the volume change between baseline and follow-up CBCT for each patient to evaluate ossification over time. There was no difference in the average volume change in the left osteotomy gap (83.38% ±15.67%) when compared with the right (86.80% ±16.61%; p = 0.15). The lingual side of the osteotomy gap (90.97% ±11.39%) showed a larger average volume change than the buccal side (79.20% ±18.10%; p < 0.01) ( Fig. 2 ).

Overall, male patients (85.54% ±17.25%) showed a greater mean (SD) volume change than female patients (84.28% ±14.22%; p = 0.74). Increasing age had a negative effect on the mean volume change (correlation coefficient −0.26; 95% CI: −0.41 to −0.10; p < 0.01) ( Fig. 4 ).

The time interval between the baseline and follow-up CBCT differed between patients, with a mean of 200 days. There was no correlation between time interval and mean volume change (correlation coefficient 0.16; 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.32).

The results of multiple linear mixed model analysis indicated that initial width of the gap and biological sex did not have an impact on the volume change between baseline and follow up ( Table 2 ). However, age showed a negative relation to volume change (regression coefficient beta −0.38; 95% CI: −0.076 to 0.00). This suggests that as age increases, the volume change tends to decrease. Furthermore, when considering the side of the mandible, the change in bony volume on the right side tended to be slightly larger than that on the left (beta 3.71; 95% CI: −0.36 to 7.82). When comparing lingual and buccal localisations, the lingual localisation exhibited a greater change in volume than the buccal localisation (beta 12.17; 95% CI: 8.07 to 16.32). This indicates that the location within the mandible influences the extent of volume change.

Discussion
We assessed risk factors for impaired osseous healing in patients who underwent BSSO of the mandible. Most studies analysing complications after orthognathic surgery do not evaluate pseudarthrosis due to its low incidence. 18 If detected, diagnosis is mainly made clinically. 1011 To our knowledge, radiographic determination of osseous healing has rarely been analysed in mandibular orthognathic surgery. Previous analyses were limited due to two-dimensional imaging 20 and lack of focus on risk factors for insufficient osseous healing. 21 Only the case series by Bouchard and Sanscartier 19 has reported possible common characteristics of patients with osseous non-union after BSSO, the authors highlighting the presence of bruxism and smoking as relevant risk factors.

To our knowledge, our study is the first to use a volumetric analysis methodology to evaluate risk factors for diminished osseous healing following BSSO of the mandible. The advantages of this approach are objectivity due to semi-automatic assessment and the possibility to quantitatively detect minor differences in osseous healing. 14

First, the results of the present study demonstrate a relevant impact of age on volume change, indicating better osseous healing following BSSO in younger patients. Experimental studies have shown the influence of age on bony healing. 22 In female Sprague Dawley rats the mechanical properties of the callus of femur fractures are directly influenced by age. 22 In their review, Clark et al 23 found that impaired vascularisation and angiogenesis, combined with senescence of the immune response and increased pro-inflammatory status were linked to poorer bone healing outcomes in the elderly population. In the head and neck area, a recent retrospective cohort study showed a positive correlation between increasing age and adverse outcomes after treatment of mandibular fractures. 24 This finding is consistent with the results of the present study and it corroborates the relevance of age on bony healing after BSSO.

Another important finding of the present study was superior bony healing at the lingual side of the mandible, as indicated by a greater change in volume. In the multivariate analysis we also considered a smaller gap size at the lingual side, but still found that the buccal side was an independent risk factor for limited bony healing compared with the lingual side. The bone healing capacity of the periosteum can be discussed as a possible explanation for this finding. While the periosteum has to be detached at the buccal side for osteosynthesis, on the lingual side only a small preparation is needed. Although muscular tissue may also take over some periosteum functions, 25 the superior relevance of the periosteum for fracture healing is assumed. 2627 On the other hand, differences in biomechanics may also have an impact on the results. According to Claes, 28 non-unions are usually caused by a combination of diminished blood supply and biomechanics. For the present study, we can only speculate about the impact of biomechanics or limited blood supply of the periosteum on osseous healing.

Unlike previous studies that have analysed bony healing, we found that the size of the initial segmental gap did not have a significant impact on healing. We have previously identified a relevant impact of initial gap size in cases of mandibular reconstruction. 14 In addition, gap size has an impact on the healing of long-bone fractures. 29 The insignificant results of the initial gap size on bony healing in this study were presumably a consequence of the methodology of determining the fracture gap in patients who underwent BSSO. Other than in long-bone studies or mandibular reconstructions, the fracture line is not usually straight. Due to the BSSO, there is always spongy bone at one side of the gap whch results in a possible osteogenic surrounding, and this may limit interpretations of the influence of initial gap size in this study. Furthermore, the large fracture gap with large parts of spongy bone may result in clinically unremarkable cases of non-union due to possible variations in bony healing caused by the large gap. However, although patients may present clinically uneventful non-unions, volumetric assessment methodology allows for the detection of weaknesses that may become clinically relevant in other patients.

Future studies should therefore clarify the general impact of age and osteotomy side on the bony healing of mandibular fractures.

Conclusion
Volumetric assessment methodology offers an objective way to assess bony healing after BSSO. Increasing age at surgery and a buccal osteotomy side are independent risk factors for impaired osseous healing following BSSO. Surgeons need to be aware of these risk factors, especially when performing orthognathic surgery in older patients for conditions such as sleep apnoea.

Although complications such as pseudarthrosis and osseous non-union are rare after BSSO, even minor undetected healing deficiencies may compromise long-term outcomes and necessitate revision surgeries. To address this, the study employs an objective, volumetric assessment methodology using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) to quantify healing and identify risk factors for impaired bony fusion.

Conducted prospectively at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery of Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin between September 2020 and December 2022, the study included 36 adult patients undergoing elective mandibular displacement via BSSO. All subjects received a baseline CBCT scan immediately after surgery and a follow-up scan at least six months later. The osteotomy gap was measured on both the buccal and lingual sides using ImageJ software, with complete ossification defined as a 100% volume change and non-union as 0%.

Key findings revealed that the initial gap width was significantly larger on the buccal side compared to the lingual side, yet the lingual aspect demonstrated a substantially greater volume change, indicating superior healing. Additionally, increasing age was negatively correlated with volume change, suggesting that older patients experience reduced osseous healing. In contrast, factors such as gap size and patient sex were not significantly related to healing outcomes. The study concludes that volumetric assessment provides a reliable means to detect subtle differences in osseous healing, thereby supporting improved surgical planning and patient management in orthognathic surgery.","This research paper investigates bone healing following Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy (BSSO) in orthognathic surgery, aiming to identify risk factors for impaired osseous healing.

Between November 2021 and February 2023, 200 adult patients presenting with facial lacerations were randomly allocated to either resorbable or non-resorbable sutures. Outcomes assessed included aesthetic results via the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Hamilton Scar Scale, patient-reported satisfaction using the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ), complication rates, and cost analysis. No significant differences were found in mean VAS scores between the two groups in both modified intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. The majority of patients reported high satisfaction levels. Early complication rates were significantly higher in the non-resorbable group at the one-week follow up, with no long-term differences noted. Preliminary cost analysis indicated a more than five-fold cost saving with resorbable sutures. Resorbable sutures provide a viable and cost-effective alternative to non-resorbable sutures for adult facial lacerations, with comparable aesthetic outcomes and patient satisfaction. Their use could reduce healthcare burdens by eliminating the need for follow-up suture removal, supporting broader adoption in clinical practice.","Introduction
Facial wounds are frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED), accounting for approximately 4–7% of all ED attendances in the UK.1 An epidemiological survey of over five million cases of head and neck trauma confirmed a broad age range of patients presenting with facial lacerations, with falls presenting as the most common mechanism of injury (64%), especially in under-18 and elderly populations. Of the identified injuries, laceration repair was required in 70% of cases.2 One of the primary aims of surgical wound management is optimal aesthetic outcome, irrespective of where the wound is sited. This is more important still in the repair of facial wounds, where the consequence of poor cosmetic outcome may have significant implications on social functioning and mental wellbeing.3, 4 Wound closure techniques vary according to the characteristics of the laceration. Topical skin adhesives and tissue-adhesive tapes effectively manage simple and superficial lacerations.5, 6, 7 However, sutures are required for the effective management of more complex lacerations, such as those that are deeper, gaping, contaminated, or span natural lines of tension.
Currently there is no universal consensus on the most appropriate suture material for facial wound repair.8 Traditionally, non-resorbable suture materials have been preferred on the face for their higher tensile strength and lower inflammatory response, which were thought to yield better outcomes. However, non-resorbable sutures present several disadvantages, notably necessitating a follow up visit for removal, which can disrupt patient flow and add inconvenience. Additionally, this requirement may lead to unnecessary patient-clinician interactions, burdening already pressured healthcare systems.
Several trials suggest that resorbable sutures are at least as effective as non-resorbable sutures in paediatric patients.9, 10 Given the additional considerations for this population, such as difficulty with suture removal and missed school time, resorbable sutures have become the standard for facial lacerations in paediatric care.
There is less clear evidence in adult patient populations supporting the use of resorbable sutures in traumatic facial injuries. Previous work in adult populations have focused on the cosmetic outcomes following operative incisions,11 which is a fundamentally different type of injury to that commonly experienced in the emergency department. The included injuries lack the complexity of lacerating injuries, which may exhibit shelving, tissue loss, tissue maceration, and contamination.12
The aim of the present randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to compare the clinical efficacy of resorbable sutures versus non-resorbable sutures in the management of facial lacerations occurring in the adult population.
Methods
Study population
The trial had national ethics approval and was registered on NIHR Clinical Research Network (CRN) Portfolio (CPMS ID: 48907) and ISCRTN (55795740). The study was caried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This manuscript includes all components of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT).
Between November 2021 and February 2023, patients aged ≥18 years, with facial lacerations presenting to the Emergency Department of Cambridge University Hospitals were evaluated for eligibility. Exclusion criteria included complex lacerations requiring closure under general anaesthetic, significant wound contamination, animal or human bites, and patients with a medical history remarkable for factors that contribute to poor wound healing (appendix). Written informed consent was provided by all enrolled patients.
Primary and secondary outcomes
The primary outcome was aesthetic outcome at six-months’ post closure as assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).13 Secondary outcomes were cosmetic outcome assessed using the Hamilton Scar Scale (as a means of further validating the primary outcome),14 patient-reported outcomes, assessed using the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ) Satisfaction with Appearance subscale,15 complications and cost.
Randomisation, blinding, and recruitment
The study was a single centre, single-blinded randomised controlled trial with two treatment arms. Participants were randomly allocated to resorbable (Vicryl Rapide) or non-resorbable (Ethilon) based on a computer-generated random allocation sequence. Block randomisation was used, with a block size of 4 and allocation ratio 1:1, and subjects were allocated randomly within each block. The allocation sequence was created before study commencement by a member of the trial team not involved in recruitment. Allocation was concealed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. Recruiting clinicians were blinded until after the participant gave their consent for recruitment to the trial. Study personnel involved in outcome assessment were blinded to group allocation until study completion. Assessors were not involved in patient care and did not access the medical records.
A trial database was created within the EPIC Electronic Health Record (Epic Systems Corporation). Eligible patients were contacted by a trained clinician or member of the trial team to introduce the study. Patients interested in trial participation provided written consent in person, prior to the procedure taking place under local anaesthetic.
Operative management
All recruiting clinicians received study instructions and a flowchart describing the study procedures as part of their research training. Standard department procedures were followed for the closure of facial lacerations. Wounds were first inspected for evidence of non-viable tissue and contamination. Contamination was managed as per standard procedure with washout and appropriate debridement of non-viable tissue as required. Washout was performed with normal saline (0.9% saline) only. Lidocaine (2%) with 1:80,000 adrenaline was employed as an anaesthetic in all cases, using blocks where appropriate (so as not to distort tissue architecture) or direct infiltration with caution to volume used. Layered closure using resorbable sutures was performed to minimise tension at the skin. Skin closure was performed using a standard interrupted instrument tie approach. Post procedure, all patients, irrespective of treatment arm received 1% chloramphenicol ointment to apply topically to the wound three times daily for five days. Deep suturing was performed only with Vicryl Rapide 3-0. Skin closure was performed with a suture size of 5-0 only – participants received either Vicryl Rapide or Ethilon as per randomisation.
Postoperative study procedures
Patients were provided with a standardised questionnaire through telephone consultation at one week and three months post injury to enquire on progress and complications (appendix). At six months’ post injury patients were asked to complete the ‘Satisfaction with Appearance’ domain of the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ). This questionnaire comprises 10 items enquiring on patient satisfaction on various aesthetic aspects of the wound in question and was chosen in light of independent validity of individual subscales and reasonable inter-rater reliability.16, 17 Additionally, patients were asked to provide three clinical photographs of the healed wound at the six-month end-point post closure, according to a standardised series of instructions (appendix). These photographs were assessed using both the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and the Hamilton Scar Scale (a scar assessment tool developed for use specifically on clinical photographs).14 Each clinical photograph was assessed for VAS by two independent Consultant assessors who were not involved in patient care and were blinded to treatment allocation.
Statistical analysis
Normality of continuous variables was assessed first visually using density and qq-plots, before quantitative evaluation using Shapiro-Wilk test. Levene’s test was used to assess for homoscedasticity between groups. Given breach of assumptions, Wilcox Rank Sum test was used to compare continuous variables between treatment arms. The chi squared test of independence was used to assess association between categorical variables, with pair-wise post-hoc comparisons using Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, if appropriate.
It has previously been determined that the minimal clinically-important difference in the visual analogue scale is 10–15 mm.13 The standard deviation of the cosmesis scores was estimated at 14mm. To detect a difference in cosmesis of 10mm, with a power of 90% (alpha 0.05), 43 patients are required per group. A recruitment target of 100 participants for each arm was set to accommodate the unpredictable rate of loss to follow-up. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.0.0, and p values <0.05 were accepted as significant.
Results
The 200 patients were recruited over a period between 13 November 2021 and 27 February 2023. The final six-month follow up was completed on 27 August 2023. The trial flow profile is presented in Figure 1. Of the 200 recruited patients, complete photographic data were obtained for 128 patients (63 non-resorbable; 65 resorbable) and 161 patients provided complete PSAQ data at the trial end point (82 non-resorbable; 79 resorbable). A modified intention to treat analysis (mITT) was undertaken including all patients providing complete data at the six-month trial end point. Eleven patients who provided final photographic data deviated from protocol: seven underwent suture removal of resorbable sutures, and four patients were prescribed antibiotics following closure. A per-protocol analysis was thus undertaken on photographic data from 117 patients (58 in the non-resorbable arm; 59 in the resorbable treatment arm.

Visual analogue score
The mean VAS for all patients providing complete data (n = 128; mITT) was 84.05 (SD 8.11). In the resorbable group, the mean (SD) VAS was 85.12 (7.62), compared to 82.94 (8.5) in the non-resorbable group for those providing complete photographic data. For protocol-compliant patients, the resorbable group had a mean (SD) VAS of 85.66 (7.54), while the non-resorbable group scored 83.84 (8.21). No significant differences in mean VAS were observed between the treatment arms in both mITT and per-protocol (PP) analyses (p = 0.213 and p = 0.320, respectively; Fig. 2).

Hamilton scar scale
The Hamilton scar scale, designed specifically to assess scar outcomes from clinical photographs, was also used to evaluate aesthetic results. Among 128 patients with complete photographic data, the median total Hamilton score was 1 [IQR 0-2] in the resorbable group and 1 [IQR 0-3] in the non-resorbable group. No significant differences in scores were found between treatment groups (W = 2306, p = 0.2068; Fig. 3). This was also true in the per-protocol analysis (W = 1922, p = 0.237).

Patient reported outcomes (PROMS)
Patient-reported outcomes were assessed at the trial’s endpoint using the ‘Satisfaction with Appearance’ domain of the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ). At this endpoint, 161 patients provided complete PSAQ data - 79 in the resorbable treatment arm and 82 in the non-resorbable arm. Across both groups, the majority of patients expressed satisfaction, with 64.3% reporting ‘Very Satisfied’ and 30.0% ‘Satisfied’ (Fig. 4). The median total PSAQ score was 11 [IQR 9-15] in both the resorbable and non-resorbable arms, with a slightly higher upper range in the non-resorbable group (IQR 9-15.75) (Fig. 5). There was no significant difference in the total PSAQ scores between the treatment groups (W = 3367, p = 0.66).

Complications
All complications reported by patients and clinicians were documented, irrespective of whether they were expected outcomes of laceration injuries. Throughout the study, 58 complications were noted during follow ups at one week, three months, and six months post injury, affecting 48 patients (24% of participants; Table 2). Swelling was the most common complication, occurring in 12 cases, followed by paraesthesia and infection, each with nine instances. In the resorbable treatment arm, there were seven cases of delayed suture resorption requiring removal.

No statistically significant difference in overall complications was observed between groups (χ2(1) = 0.685, p = 0.408). However, a significant association was found between early complications at the 1-week follow-up and the non-resorbable treatment arm (χ2(1) = 5.50, p = 0.019; Supplementary Table S4; Fig. 5). No significant differences were noted in complication rates at the three- and six-month follow ups between groups (χ2(1) = 0.16, p = 0.688 and χ2(1) = 1.998e-32, p = 1, respectively).
Brief cost evaluation
It is assumed there were no differences in the time required for wound closure between treatment arms, thus excluding the initial encounter cost from this preliminary cost analysis. Therefore, the analysis focuses solely on the cost differences between treatments due to the unit cost of suture materials and any necessary follow ups in the non-resorbable treatment arm. According to the ‘Unit Costs of Health and Social Care Programme’ (2022–2027), the estimated unit cost for a general practitioner is £41 for a 9.22-minute patient consultation, and £52 per hour for a GP practice nurse, which translates to £13 per interaction for the required 15-minute appointment to remove sutures.18 At time of writing, the NHS supply chain cost of a single Ethilon suture was £1.79 compared with £2.77 for a single Vicryl Rapide suture. The estimated cost of material and required follow up across this trial was thus at least £1479 for the non-resorbable group (assuming nurse practitioner suture removal and excluding the additional expense of equipment required for suture removal), compared to £277 to the resorbable group.
Discussion
The TORN Face trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of resorbable (Vicryl Rapide) versus non-resorbable (Ethilon) sutures in managing adult facial lacerations. This study fills a notable gap in the literature, as previously, there was a lack of high-quality evidence comparing these suture materials and their outcomes in this specific population. Traditional guidelines have favoured non-resorbable sutures for skin closure, citing their higher tensile strength and lower inflammatory response. However, these preferences were established prior to the advent of advanced fast-absorbing materials and have not been rigorously tested in clinical trials.
Our findings indicate no significant difference in aesthetic outcomes between Vicryl Rapide and Ethilon sutures when measured by both the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Hamilton Scar Scale. These results are consistent across modified intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, suggesting that with regards to cosmetic outcome, resorbable sutures offer a viable and non-inferior alternative to non-resorbable sutures in adult populations. Moreover, the high patient satisfaction rates reported in both groups further support the clinical acceptability of resorbable sutures. The ‘Satisfaction with Appearance’ domain of the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ) demonstrated that the majority of patients were either ‘Very Satisfied’ or ‘Satisfied’ with their surgical outcomes, which underscores the potential for resorbable sutures to be used more broadly in clinical practice without compromising patient perceptions of cosmetic success.
The complication rates observed in this study further reinforce the safety of using resorbable sutures. Again, there was no significant difference between overall complication rates. However, a detailed analysis revealed a significant association between early complications and non-resorbable sutures at the one-week follow up, though no long-term differences were evident at three and six months. The higher rate of early complications in the non-resorbable group may be attributed to the differing handling properties or the requirement for suture removal, which can itself increase the risk of discomfort and infection. It is important to note that we inclusively recorded all complications reported by patients and clinicians, and thus, caution is advised in interpreting these early complication rates, especially since the non-resorbable group required an additional clinician encounter. Perhaps the more important conclusion, is that the resorbable group did not experience an increase in complication rates, effectively dispelling previous concerns about heightened inflammation and infection.
While a comprehensive and systematic economic evaluation was beyond the scope of this manuscript, we conducted a preliminary cost analysis focused on readily measurable variables, independent of assumptions. This analysis provides compelling economic evidence supporting the use of resorbable sutures, revealing a cost saving of more than five times compared to non-resorbable sutures. It is important to note that our analysis primarily covered direct costs, such as healthcare provider time and materials, and did not account for indirect costs, including patient inconvenience and potential productivity loss. Therefore, we anticipate that a planned more detailed cost analysis will reveal even greater cost savings.
As with any study, consideration must be given to the trial’s limitations. The sample size was sufficient to detect differences in aesthetic outcomes but may not have fully captured less common complications. Additionally, as the study was conducted in a single centre, this may limit the generalisability of the findings. However, the baseline characteristics of our sample were representative of the broader UK population, supporting the relevance of our results across different settings.
In the paediatric population, the benefits of using resorbable sutures are well recognised. Specifically, the challenges associated with suture removal in children shift the focus of clinical decision-making. A greater emphasis is placed on avoiding the additional anxiety and risks of a second procedure, thus the balance shifts towards resorbable sutures, which offer more benefits than risks. While the advantages might not be as immediately apparent, the benefits of resorbable sutures for adults are also present. By necessitating only a single patient encounter, resorbable sutures not only enhance convenience but also reduce healthcare costs. They help streamline patient flow in busy healthcare settings and minimise unnecessary patient-clinician interactions, providing benefits to both the health system and patients. Previous studies, albeit in different populations, have demonstrated the non-inferiority of resorbable sutures.9, 10, 11 The TORN Face trial results demonstrate comparable efficacy, good safety profile, and cost-effectiveness; thus, our findings suggest that resorbable sutures are a good option for the closure of facial lacerations in adults. This could lead to a shift in clinical practice norms and potentially reduce the burden on healthcare resources.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the TORN Face trial supports the use of resorbable sutures for facial lacerations in adults, with no compromise in aesthetic outcomes or patient satisfaction when compared to non-resorbable sutures. The additional benefit of lower costs provides a strong argument for their adoption in routine clinical practice.

No identifying information presented.","The TORN Face trial evaluated whether resorbable sutures (Vicryl Rapide) are non-inferior to non-resorbable sutures (Ethilon) for repairing adult facial lacerations. Facial injuries account for 4–7% of UK emergency department visits, and achieving optimal cosmetic outcomes is essential due to their potential social and psychological impact. Traditional practice has favored non-resorbable sutures for their tensile strength and low inflammatory response; however, these require a follow-up removal visit, increasing patient inconvenience and healthcare burden.

In this single-centre, single-blinded randomized controlled trial conducted at Cambridge University Hospitals (November 2021–February 2023), 200 adult patients with facial lacerations were allocated equally between the two suture types. Standardized operative protocols were followed, with layered closure under local anesthesia and uniform postoperative care. The primary outcome was aesthetic appearance at six months, assessed via the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Hamilton Scar Scale, while secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction (using the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire) and complication rates.

Results indicated no significant differences in aesthetic outcomes between resorbable and non-resorbable sutures, with high satisfaction reported in both groups. Although overall complication rates were comparable, early complications were more common in the non-resorbable group. A preliminary cost analysis revealed that resorbable sutures offered a significant financial advantage by eliminating the need for suture removal visits.

In summary, the trial demonstrates that resorbable sutures provide a safe, cosmetically equivalent, and more cost-effective alternative for adult facial laceration repair, supporting their broader adoption in clinical practice.","This randomized controlled trial, the TORN Face trial, compared resorbable (Vicryl Rapide) and non-resorbable (Ethilon) sutures for adult facial laceration repair in an emergency department setting, addressing a gap in existing research focused on operative incisions rather than traumatic injuries. 200 adult participants with facial lacerations were recruited and randomly assigned to either suture type. Aesthetic outcomes were assessed at six months using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Hamilton Scar Scale, with patient satisfaction measured via the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ).

The study found no significant difference in aesthetic outcomes or patient satisfaction between the two suture types. While early complications were more common in the non-resorbable group, overall complication rates did not differ significantly. A preliminary cost analysis showed resorbable sutures were significantly more cost-effective due to the elimination of suture removal appointments.

The authors conclude that resorbable sutures are a viable, non-inferior, and cost-effective alternative to non-resorbable sutures for adult facial laceration repair, potentially streamlining patient flow and reducing healthcare costs without compromising cosmetic results or patient satisfaction.","The TORN Face trial compared the efficacy of resorbable (Vicryl Rapide) and non-resorbable (Ethilon) sutures for facial laceration repair in adults, addressing a gap in evidence for suture material choice in this population. Conducted at Cambridge University Hospitals, the single-blind randomized controlled trial involved 200 patients, with outcomes assessed at six months using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Hamilton Scar Scale, and Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ). Results showed no significant difference in aesthetic outcomes or patient satisfaction between the two suture types, with both groups reporting high satisfaction rates (64.3% ""Very Satisfied""). Complication rates were similar, though non-resorbable sutures were associated with more early complications, likely due to the need for suture removal. A preliminary cost analysis revealed resorbable sutures to be over five times more cost-effective, primarily due to eliminating the need for follow-up visits. The study concludes that resorbable sutures are a safe, effective, and economical option for facial laceration repair in adults, supporting their broader adoption in clinical practice. Limitations include the single-center design and potential under-detection of rare complications. The findings align with pediatric studies and suggest a shift in practice norms to reduce healthcare burdens and improve patient convenience.",5,3.2,16.6,,,90,95,10,100,85,90,10,100,83,88,10,100

Compartmental ITF clearance was done in 93 patients; the rest had standard surgical clearance. A total of 112 patients had node-positive disease. The median (range) age of the group was 50 (24?84) years. On a median follow up of 54 months (IQR: 1?111 months), 136 (62.4%) were alive and 82 (37.6%) had died. Five-year locoregional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 54%, 52%, and 59%, respectively.

Oral cancer is a common cancer in low and middle income countries. 1 According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) (2020), 3,77,713 new cases of lip and oral cancer, along with 1,77,757 deaths were seen all over the world. 1 It is the most common cancer seen in South Asian males, gingivobuccal cancers being the most prevalent oral cancers in India. 23 The eighth edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system classifies locally advanced disease of the buccal mucosa as T4a (moderately advanced local disease) and T4b (very advanced local disease). 4 This division of T4 lesions dictates their rate of resectability, treatment outcomes, survival rates, and overall prognosis.

There has been a prevailing muddle in the management of T4b lesions, varying from surgeon to surgeon and centre to centre. In some centres T4b is currently considered unresectable and is managed by palliative care or neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical management. Possible reasons for this are the complex multidimensional anatomy and proximity to the skull base, hence the difficulty in attaining sufficient margins during resection ( Fig. 1 ). Also, involvement of masticator space is commonly associated with trismus, which makes assessment even more difficult.

Pathways of disease spread in masticator space.
These challenges amalgamated together have often led to poor prognosis for T4b lesions. However, from time to time this concept has been challenged. The outcomes in T4b buccal mucosa- gingivobuccal complex cancers have been proved to be better with surgical treatments than non-surgical ones, 5 and studies have shown no significant difference in survival rates of surgically managed T4a and selected T4b lesions. 67 Although there has been some headway in the last few years with much data being generated from the Indian subcontinent regarding management protocols for T4b tumours, 891011 due to limited literature, this penumbra still persists.

Material and methods
This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained data of all patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the buccal mucosa involving the masticator space (categorised as cT4b), which were collected over eight years between January 2013 and December 2021. A total of 218 patients were evaluated.

Involvement of any one of the five components of the masticator space (ramus of the mandible, masseter muscle, medial pterygoid muscle, lateral pterygoid muscle, or temporalis muscle) was considered as an inclusion criterion. 6 Patients with encasement of the carotid artery, involvement of the skull base or pterygomaxillary fissure, and distant metastasis, were excluded, as they were deemed to have unresectable/metastatic disease.

All patients underwent composite resection of the buccal mucosa (removal of buccal mucosa along with bone/skin, or also upper alveolus, in which case it is referred to as bite composite resection) comprising wide excision of tumour with a macroscopic margin of 1 cm along with resection of the mandible and/or upper alveolus. In addition, clearance of the infratemporal fossa (ITF) was done in patients with involvement of the masticator space and more than two of the following structures: medial and lateral pterygoid muscles, pterygoid plates, temporalis at the tip of the coronoid, high masseter, retroantral fat pad. The boundaries of clearance were defined medially as Eustachian tube, laterally as capsule of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and superiorly as greater wing of sphenoid bone. All muscles, fibrofatty tissue and neurovascular bundle, retroantral fat, and pterygoid plates in that region were removed to achieve full clearance.

The pre-surgical workup included clinical evaluation, medical history, radiological evaluation (computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or ultrasound of the neck), routine blood investigations, chest radiograph, and electrocardiogram (ECG). All patients were staged as cT4b based on radiological involvement of any of structure of the masticator space. A contrast-enhanced CT thorax/PET CT was done to confirm distant metastasis to the lungs in all cases.

Primary tumours were excised, and modified radical or selective neck dissection was performed in all cases depending on the clinical nodal disease and institution’s protocol. Patients with oedema crossing the zygoma or oedema going to the parotid were managed prior to surgery with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Following National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, postoperative adjuvant therapy was given according to the final histopathology report. The histopathology reports mentioned thickness and depth of invasion apart from other factors as part of standard synaptic reporting. Involvement of the muscles of mastication was not mentioned independently.

Data were collected on baseline characteristics, clinical outcomes, complications, regional and locoregional recurrence, disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS). OS was calculated as the time in months between death due to any cause and date of surgery; disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated as the time between local, regional, or locoreginal recurrence, distant metastasis, or second primary, and date of surgery. Similarly, locoregional control was calculated as the time between local or regional recurrence and date of surgery. Death due to other causes was not counted for DFS, or local or locoregional control. The appearance of skin nodules in the neck was considered to be distant metastasis for the estimation of DFS.

Prognostic variables were analysed using the log rank test for univariate analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model for multivariate analysis. Survival analysis was done using Kaplan Meier survival estimates. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The graphical assessment of data and all calculations were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 25 (IBM Corp).

Results
A total of 596 patients with biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) operated on by a single surgical team were recorded to be in the clinical T4 category. According to the eighth edition AJCC staging system, and based on preoperative clinical evaluation and radiographic investigations, 218 of them had clinical T4b disease involving the buccal mucosa and gingivobuccal complex.

There were 192 (88%) males and 26 (12%) females in the study (median (range) age 50.5 (24-84) years). All patients underwent resection and neck dissection as described above. Twenty-nine (14%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. A total of 144 (66%) underwent reconstruction with a free flap, 74 (34%) with a pedicled flap (PMMC). Of the total free flap reconstructions, free anterolateral thigh flaps were most commonly used ( n = 117, 81%), followed by free osseocutaneous fibular flaps ( n = 21, 15%), and free radial forearm flaps ( n = 6, 4%) ( Table 1 ).

For a subgroup of patients with pT3 disease ( n = 23) compared with pT4 ( n = 178), five-year locoregional control was 54% compared with 51% (p = 0.513), DFS was 54% compared with 50% (p = 0.43), and OS 66% compared with 56%, respectively (p = 0.33).

Discussion
According to the eighth edition AJCC staging, T4b disease is very advanced local disease when it invades the masticator space, pterygoid plates, skull base, and/or encases the internal carotid artery. 4 The masticator space is a pyramidal space with its base towards the skull base and its apex at the lower border of the mandible. 1213 It is a complex 3-dimensional area with important anatomical structures. It was divided by Liao et al into two parts based on the location of the mandibular notch: supra-notch and infra-notch. 6 Infra-notch disease is often considered operable while supra-notch disease is generally considered for downstaging by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical salvage. 1415

The management of T4b buccal mucosa-gingivobuccal complex cancers begins right at the initial clinical examination due to reduced mouth opening. This may be due to masticatory muscle involvement and/or submucous fibrosis, which is very prevalent in south-east Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Trismus causes reduced accessibility and diagnostic difficulty. Radiographic investigations aid in diagnosis, but assessment of the extent and margins requires good quality scans with low slice thickness. Furthermore, surgical management and outcomes are also dependent on the surgical team and their experience. The proximity of T4b buccal mucosal lesions to the skull base is yet another hurdle for surgical excision with adequate margins.

Surgical clearance of T4b buccal mucosa-gingivobuccal complex cancers includes wide excision of the buccal mucosa and masticatory muscles with/without upper alveolectomy. To achieve adequate clearance, we aim for macroscopic margins of 1 cm with complete removal of the masseter, medial and lateral pterygoid muscles, and head of the temporalis muscle, along with retroantral fat. The pterygoid muscles are excised at their attachment at the pterygoid plates (medial and lateral). The bleed due to the pterygoid venous plexus encountered during pterygoid clearance is easily managed using bipolar or ultrasonic shearers. If full ITF clearance is warranted (>2 structures involved in the ITF) it is done as already explained in detail in Material and Methods.

In the sixth edition of the AJCC, oral cavity lesions were classified as T4a (resectable) or T4b (unresectable) ( Fig. 3 ). 1617 This was the accepted line of thought until it was challenged by Liao et al who presented their data on the outcomes of surgically resected T4b lesions, which were comparable to T4a oral cavity cancers. They stated that no statistical difference was observed in five-year local control, neck control, DFS, and OS rates between T4a and infra-notch T4b groups. 67

Obtaining a negative pathological margin in the high ITF region can be a tedious task that may compromise the surgical outcome. Thus, these tumours are not unresectable, as they can be resected, but removing the tumour with adequate safety margins is not always feasible. Trivedi et al suggested en-bloc compartmental clearance of the ITF within the anatomical fascial planes, and proposed that piecemeal excision would result in compromised margins due to inadequate mapping. 8 Authors in previous publications have shown that ITF clearance in advanced ITF disease (involvement of more than 2 clinical structures in the ITF) is feasible and that two-year survival and three-year OS and DFS are similar to those in T4a disease. 10

Liao et al presented data for cT4b disease, with five-year local control, DFS, and OS of 70%, 62% and 47%, respectively, compared with our rates of 54%, 52% and 59%, respectively. The difference might be attributed to the higher number of cT4b patients included in our study (45 vs 218) and also to the fact that 93 of the 218 (43%) had involvement of three or more clinical structures in the ITF, a subgroup with an advanced disease subset. Another difference in our study was that we did not follow the criteria of Liao et al for infra-notch and supra-notch disease, but considered disease based on the structures involved (involvement of the pterygomaxillary fissure being an indication for unresectability).

In a study by Mair et al on cT4b oral cancer squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) with a median follow up of 20 months, it was reported that 50.7% of patients were alive and 38.7% disease-free, which nearly coincides with our results. In our series, we found distant metastasis in 49 (22.5%), compared with 27.1% in Pillai et al and 29.54% in Mair et al. 911

A recent meta-analysis by Rao et al (7 studies and 11,381 patients) compared the surgical outcomes of infra-notch T4b and T4a. For infra-notch T4b patients, five-year OS, DFS, local control, and DSS was 53.2%, 48.4%, 56%, and 68%, respectively, almost similar to our data set (OS 59%, DFS 52%, loco-regional control 54%). 18

Our study was conducted at a single tertiary care centre, so our results may not be applicable to other centres with different demographics and clinical profiles, although the surgical technique is standardised and replicable. Authors believe that the independent reporting of the pterygoid and temporalis muscles should be part of synaptic reporting, which was not the case in this study, being a retrospective database. The tagging of muscles should be considered when submitting the specimen for reporting.

The study, being retrospective in nature, has limitations, for example, functional quality of life was not analysed. At the same time, to our knowledge, this is largest cohort of purely cT4b OCSCC patients reported in the literature, unlike other studies that put cT4a and cT4b groups together, and it therefore provides robust data with strong follow up.

Conclusion
The study concludes that favourable outcomes can be achieved in a certain subset of T4b patients who can be surgically managed, suggesting significant clinical implications. However, we put forth the idea that patients with T4b disease form a large and variable subgroup, all of whom cannot be categorised to have similar presentations, treatment protocols, or outcomes. Further segregation or reclassification of cT4b disease is therefore required in view of the emerging data on T4b oral cavity cancers.

N/A.","This research project evaluates the management and outcomes of advanced T4b oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) of the buccal mucosa and gingivobuccal complex, a major cancer burden in low and middle-income countries, especially South Asia. The study focuses on tumors invading the masticator space—a complex, three-dimensional region involving the ramus of the mandible, masseter, medial and lateral pterygoid, and temporalis muscles—which poses significant challenges for achieving clear surgical margins due to its proximity to the skull base and involvement of critical structures.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on prospectively maintained data from 218 patients treated between January 2013 and December 2021. Patients selected had clinical T4b disease with involvement of at least one component of the masticator space, while those with carotid encasement, skull base involvement, or distant metastasis were excluded. The surgical protocol involved composite resection of the buccal mucosa with at least a 1 cm macroscopic margin, accompanied by neck dissection. In cases with reduced mouth opening due to trismus, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered prior to surgery. Reconstruction was performed using free flaps (predominantly anterolateral thigh flaps) or pedicled flaps.

At a median follow-up of 54 months, the study reported five-year locoregional control of 54%, disease-free survival of 52%, and overall survival of 59%. Multivariate analysis identified nodal involvement, perineural invasion, and bone involvement as significant prognostic factors. The findings suggest that, contrary to previous assumptions of unresectability, a subset of T4b lesions can be managed surgically with favorable outcomes, highlighting the need for further reclassification of this heterogeneous group.","This retrospective study analyzes the outcomes of surgically treated cT4b buccal mucosa cancers involving the masticator space, a complex anatomical area. Examining data from 218 patients treated between 2013 and 2021, the study assesses the feasibility and efficacy of surgical resection, including infratemporal fossa clearance. Patients with carotid artery encasement, skull base involvement, or distant metastasis were excluded.

The research challenges the traditional view of T4b lesions as universally unresectable, noting varying management approaches. The study found five-year locoregional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates of 54%, 52%, and 59%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified nodal disease, perineural invasion, and bone involvement as significant factors affecting overall survival.

While acknowledging limitations such as its single-center, retrospective nature, the study argues that surgical management can lead to favorable outcomes in select T4b cases. It advocates for a re-evaluation and potential reclassification of T4b disease to better tailor treatment strategies and improve prognosis, given the heterogeneity within this classification. The authors suggest independent reporting of pterygoid and temporalis muscles, as well as tagging of muscles, should be part of synaptic reporting.","This study evaluates the surgical management and outcomes of locally advanced (cT4b) buccal mucosa and gingivobuccal complex cancers involving the masticator space, a challenging subset of oral cancers often considered unresectable. Conducted over eight years (2013–2021) at a single tertiary care center, the study included 218 patients with cT4b disease, defined by involvement of the masticator space but excluding skull base or carotid artery involvement. Surgical resection involved composite resection of the buccal mucosa, mandible, and/or upper alveolus, with infratemporal fossa (ITF) clearance in advanced cases. Reconstruction was performed using free or pedicled flaps. 

Results showed a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 59%, disease-free survival (DFS) of 52%, and locoregional control of 54%. Multivariate analysis identified nodal disease, perineural invasion, and bone involvement as significant prognostic factors affecting OS. Complications were minimal, with 69% of patients experiencing no or grade 1 complications. The study highlights that surgical management of selected cT4b cases yields favorable outcomes, comparable to T4a lesions, challenging the traditional view of T4b as unresectable. 

The findings suggest that T4b oral cancers are a heterogeneous group, and further subclassification may be necessary to refine treatment protocols. The study advocates for surgical resection in carefully selected cases, supported by robust data from the largest reported cohort of cT4b oral cancers. Limitations include its retrospective nature and lack of functional quality-of-life assessment.

Sarcopenia is an important component of frailty. This study aimed to establish the relevance of sarcopenia in elderly patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) undergoing surgery. This retrospective, single-centre, cohort study included patients over the age of 75 years who were diagnosed with OSCC between 2007 and 2016. Cross-sectional imaging of the neck was used to predict the Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) using validated equations.

Increasing numbers of older people are undergoing elective and emergency surgery. 1 This coincides with an increased incidence of head and neck cancer (HNC) in the UK, particularly in older age groups. Between 2016 and 2018, 22% of new cases were in people aged 75 and over, and between 2017 and 2019, this demographic accounted for 36% of HNC-related deaths. The steepest age-specific mortality rates are in the 80–84 and 90 plus age groups. 2 These population-based statistics underscore an evolving necessity for clinicians to manage treatment decisions within an older patient cohort. The higher prevalence of frailty syndromes within this group complicates such decisions. Therefore, understanding the nuances of treating older patients with frailty, and understanding why some are more likely to have poorer outcomes, is essential.

Frailty is a clinical syndrome defined as a multidomain decline in physiological reserve and function resulting in increased vulnerability to stressors such as surgery. 3 Sarcopenia, an important component of frailty, is defined as acute or chronic adverse muscle changes occurring across a lifetime and measured by three parameters (muscle strength, muscle quantity/quality, and physical performance) as indicators of severity. 4

Sarcopenia is prevalent in HNC patients (16%–71%), 5 and it is linked to additional treatment burden, including postoperative complications, 6 chemotherapy dose-limiting toxicity, 7 radiation therapy toxicity, 8 and decreased overall survival and disease-free survival. 9 While not every frail patient exhibits sarcopenia, there is considerable overlap. Multiple tools to measure frailty are being integrated into national guidelines. 1011 However, in recent years these measures, which need to be performed prospectively, have not been included in routine HNC care. As a result, we cannot utilise them to demonstrate the impact of frailty on treatment outcomes when scrutinising retrospective cohorts.

All patients undergoing treatment for HNC are subject to cross-sectional imaging before treatment. This imaging may potentially reveal evidence of sarcopenia and, by extension, frailty, at the commencement of treatment. Cross-sectional measurement of the psoas major derived from imaging serves as an effective measure of skeletal mass. 4 In UK HNC practice, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is not typically part of the diagnostic workup. 12 As such, Swartz et al validated the use of CT neck at the level of C3 vertebrae as a valid alternative to abdominal imaging. 13 Moreover, Zwart et al validated the use of staging MRI of the neck at the C3 level as a valid surrogate marker for skeletal muscle mass analysis, a viable option in HNC patients typically undergoing MR imaging of the neck. 14

This study aimed to determine the impact of sarcopenia in elderly patients undergoing surgical treatment for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and the consequent effects on surgical complications and overall survival.

Methods
The patient cohort for this study was derived from a previously published dataset used by Chieng et al . 15 The study population comprised patients aged 75 years and over who were diagnosed with OSCC and treated at Liverpool University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2016. Authorisation for the study was provided through the local clinical audit management system. Data were extracted from electronic case notes, outpatient clinical letters, and multidisciplinary forms. Demographic data included age, sex, smoking and alcohol status, clinical and pathological staging (AJCC 7), treatment intent (curative/palliative), treatment type/extent, and residence at diagnosis. Outcome data collected included length of hospital stay, postoperative complications using the Clavien-Dindo classification and Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI), 30-day mortality, and five-year overall survival.

Patients who did not have accessible CT/MRI neck scans within six months of OSCC diagnosis were excluded. Data on patients’ preoperative height and weight were extracted from case notes. Patients were included in the study only if all these data were available.

The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the paravertebral (PVM) and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles were independently delineated at the level of the C3 vertebra using the ‘freehand measurement’ function in Vue PACS imaging software version 12.2.2 (Carestream). The total skeletal muscle CSA at the level of C3 was determined by the sum of the CSA of the PVM/SCM muscles.

Based on the prediction rule proposed by Swartz et al, 13 the CSA at L3 was approximated using the measured CSA at C3, and the patient’s height, weight, age, and sex. The skeletal muscle index at the L3 vertebra (L3 SMI) level was then calculated. The equations for both calculations are shown in Fig. 1 .

Equations used to calculate the Skeletal Muscle Index from cross-sectional area measurement of muscle at the C3 vertebra level.
The calculated L3 SMI was categorised as either ‘low’ or ‘normal’. A low SMI was defined as an L3 SMI of <42.0 cm 2 /m 2 in males and <31.2 cm 2 /m 2 in females. This is based on the thresholds determined by Karavolia et al. 8 These threshold values were derived from the lowest sex-specific quartiles, and closely mirror those determined by van der Werf et al (<41.6 cm 2 /m 2 in males and <32 cm 2 /m 2 in females). 16 Van der Werf et al utilised a healthy Caucasian population of potential living kidney donors and determined the thresholds from the lowest 5% of the study population. 16 Thus, the threshold values for a low SMI are corroborated by multiple studies using different techniques and patient populations, reinforcing robustness.

Statistical analysis
Comparisons between groups involving categorical data were performed using Fisher’s exact test, while the t test was used for comparisons involving continuous data. Survival estimates of five-year overall survival for all patients ≥75 years and for patients ≥75 years who underwent primary curative surgery were ascertained using Kaplan-Meier curves. The log-rank test was used to compare these survival distributions. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 28.0.1 (IBM Corp), with statistical significance determined at p < 0.05.

Results
Of the 236 patients over 75 who were diagnosed with OSCC within the study period, 69 met the inclusion criteria (41 male, 28 female). Cross-sectional imaging for CSA calculation was available for 87, while height and weight data were missing in 18. Of those included, 42 (60.9%) had a low SMI and 27 (39.1%) a normal SMI. Table 1 outlines the difference in patient demographics between the two groups. Significant differences were identified in mean (SD) age (low SMI 81.6 (4.5) years; normal SMI 78.9 (3.5) years; p = 0.010) as well as a tendency for more patients in the low SMI group to be treated palliatively (low SMI 8/42 (19.0%); normal SMI 1/27 (3.7%); p = 0.079). Other comparisons in baseline demographics yielded differences, albeit not statistically significant ( Table 1 ).

The difference in surgical outcomes between the two groups is demonstrated in Table 2 . Patients with a low SMI had a statistically significant longer length of stay by a mean difference of seven days (mean (SD) 16.9 (13.1) days vs 9.8 (10.1) days, p = 0.030). The proportion of patients with severe complications, defined as Clavien-Dindo grade IIIb or higher, was statistically significantly higher in the low SMI group (17.6% vs 4.0%, p = 0.042). The mean CCI, which accounts for all complications, including less severe complications as well as the additional burden of multiple complications in the same patient, was also significantly higher in the low SMI group (mean (SD) 14.1 (21.2) vs 4.7 (1.5), p = 0.051). Furthermore, 2/34 patients in the low SMI group died within 30 days of surgery compared with none in the normal SMI group (5.9% vs 0%, p = 0.503).

The five-year overall survival rate for all patients, calculated from the date of diagnosis, was 37.7% (SE: 2.8). For those in the low SMI cohort it was 34.2% (SE: 3.6), while in the normal SMI cohort it was 43.2% (SE: 4.2). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve ( Fig. 2 ) clearly delineates the distinct survival outcomes of the two cohorts. The overall survival rate was notably lower in the low SMI group. However, the difference, as assessed by the log-rank test, did not reach the threshold for statistical significance (p = 0.120). This analysis included patients who were treated with palliative intent from the outset.

The five-year overall survival rate for patients treated with primary curative surgery, calculated from the date of surgery, was 41.5% (SE 2.8). For those in the low SMI cohort, the five-year overall survival rate was 39.7% (SE 3.8); in the normal SMI cohort it was 43.9% (SE 4.2). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve ( Fig. 3 ) exhibits a less distinct separation between the two cohorts. This is particularly noticeable in the first postoperative year, where the survival trajectories overlap. The difference, as assessed by the log-rank test, did not reach the threshold for statistical significance (p = 0.384).

Discussion
This study shows that patients with a low SMI who undergo surgery experience an extended hospital stay of one week and have a significantly increased risk of severe complications. Our findings align with previously reported data on length of hospital stay and complications. Specifically, Chieng et al found a median post-surgery stay of eight days, comparable to our normal SMI group's mean of 9.8 days. 15 However, the low SMI group in the current study had a markedly prolonged stay. Chieng et al reported that 10% of patients encountered Clavien-Dindo grade III complications or worse. 15 This study reported a similar overall severe complication rate of 12%, with the low SMI group having an increased rate of 17.6%. This indicates that SMI might be a better indicator of postoperative complications than age alone. Fewer patients in the normal SMI group underwent extensive surgery with free-flap reconstruction (40.0% with a normal SMI vs 52.9% with a low SMI), and both perioperative deaths were in the low SMI group.

The current dataset suggests that patients with a low SMI tend to have poorer survival outcomes. However, this observation is not statistically significant, probably due to the limited sample size. The survival data from Rogers et al 17 and Chieng et al 15 regarding patients treated for OSCC are consistent with this study. For patients aged ≥75 years, Rogers et al 17 reported a five-year survival rate of 37% and Chieng et al 15 reported one of 34%. The current study indicates a slightly higher rate of 39.7%. When comparing the Kaplan-Meier curves in Figs. 2 and 3 , the survival trajectories for patients undergoing curative treatments are more similar. This is likely to reflect patient selection based on various clinical and social considerations.

The threshold for sarcopenia is variable amongst similar published studies. Stone et al reported a five-year survival rate of 36.5% for sarcopenic patients and 60.5% survival for non-sarcopenic patients. 9 It is noteworthy that their cohort primarily comprised patients of below 70 years of age with SMI cut-offs of 52.4 cm 2 /m 2 for men and 38.5 cm 2 /m 2 for women. In contrast, Orzell et al, who studied patients over 50, set a uniform SMI cut-off of 43.2 cm 2 /m 2 , and reported survival rates of 46% for sarcopenic and 70% for non-sarcopenic patients. 18

Limitations
While sarcopenia may predict postoperative complications and length of admission in patients undergoing primary curative surgery, high-quality postoperative care and long-term survivorship can offset the impact of sarcopenia and, by extension, frailty, on overall survival.

Unfortunately, these data do not include the cause of death or provide any metrics related to the quality of life (QoL) of survivors to enable discussion on trade-offs. Elderly patients with sarcopenia are likely to incur higher healthcare costs. The absence of data on QoL precludes a cost-utility analysis, highlighting an avenue for possible future research.

The current data were from a substantially truncated sample due to the necessity of specific records (access to cross-sectional imaging on radiographic viewing software, and height and weight at the time of diagnosis), which were available only for some patients. However, the similarities in survival and surgical complications between this cohort and those reported by Rogers et al 17 and Chieng et al 15 suggest minimal selection bias.

Implications for patient care
Banh Chong et al showed the benefits of a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in improving the three-year survival of frail HNC patients over 70 who were treated by surgery. 19 The CGA can enhance survival by identifying vulnerable patients and tailoring their care. This may involve moderating treatment for some while ensuring that others receive optimal curative treatment. The CGA can also initiate multidisciplinary care and address preoperative risks, minimising polypharmacy, preventing postoperative delirium, starting rehabilitation, and bolstering home support. Outside the setting of HNC, a meta-analysis revealed that for elderly patients admitted to hospital for a broad range of conditions, those who underwent a CGA had better survival rates and a better chance of living at home after discharge. 20 The benefits of a CGA are also reflected in the orthogeriatric literature and include a cost-utility benefit. 2122

Meekerk et al established a correlation between sarcopenia and frailty diagnosed by a CGA. 23 Consequently, a preoperative assessment of SMI based on cross-sectional neck imaging could offer an additional metric to identify patients who would benefit from a CGA. However, before advocating its widespread use, there must be greater standardisation of SMI thresholds based on neck imaging.

Conclusion
This study highlights the value of SMI as a predictor of postoperative complications and prolonged hospital stays. The data support existing findings, and underscore the vulnerability of patients with a low SMI. With the established link between sarcopenia and frailty, integration of a preoperative SMI assessment from neck imaging could help identify patients who would benefit from a CGA. Future studies should explore frail patients' quality of life post HNC surgery to better understand the impact of sarcopenia and frailty on surgical outcomes.

With an increasing incidence of head and neck cancer among older populations in the UK (notably, 22% of new cases and 36% of related deaths occur in patients aged 75 and above), understanding how frailty affects treatment is critical. The study retrospectively analyzed patients aged 75 years and over who were diagnosed with OSCC and treated at Liverpool University Hospital between 2007 and 2016.

Data were collected from clinical records, imaging studies, and multidisciplinary team forms. Cross-sectional imaging of the neck at the C3 vertebra level was used to measure the areas of the paravertebral and sternocleidomastoid muscles. Using established predictive equations, these measurements were converted into a skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the L3 level, categorizing patients as having either a low or normal SMI based on validated thresholds. Out of 69 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 60.9% had a low SMI.

Patients with a low SMI experienced significantly longer hospital stays (mean of 16.9 days versus 9.8 days) and a higher incidence of severe postoperative complications (17.6% vs 4.0%). Although their five-year overall survival was lower (34.2% vs 43.2%), this difference did not reach statistical significance. The study concludes that preoperative SMI assessment via routine neck imaging could serve as an additional marker of frailty, helping to identify patients who may benefit from a comprehensive geriatric assessment to optimize surgical outcomes.","This study investigates the impact of sarcopenia, measured by the skeletal muscle index (SMI) derived from routine neck imaging, on surgical outcomes in elderly (≥75 years) patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Retrospective analysis of 69 patients revealed that those with low SMI experienced significantly longer hospital stays and a higher rate of severe postoperative complications. While overall survival was lower in the low SMI group, this difference was not statistically significant, possibly due to limited sample size. The study suggests that SMI, as an indicator of frailty, is a valuable predictor of surgical outcomes, potentially identifying patients who would benefit from a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). However, standardized SMI thresholds and future research exploring quality of life and cost-utility are needed before widespread integration into routine care. The findings emphasize the vulnerability of elderly patients with sarcopenia undergoing OSCC surgery.","This research paper investigates the impact of sarcopenia, a component of frailty characterized by muscle loss, on surgical outcomes in elderly patients (≥75 years) undergoing treatment for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). With the rising incidence of head and neck cancer (HNC) in older populations, understanding the role of frailty and sarcopenia in treatment outcomes is critical. Sarcopenia, prevalent in 16%–71% of HNC patients, is linked to increased postoperative complications, longer hospital stays, and reduced survival rates. The study utilized cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI) at the C3 vertebra level to measure skeletal muscle mass and calculate the skeletal muscle index (SMI), a proxy for sarcopenia.

The study analyzed 69 patients, categorizing them into low and normal SMI groups. Results showed that patients with low SMI had significantly longer hospital stays (mean difference of 7 days), higher rates of severe complications (17.6% vs. 4.0%), and a higher Comprehensive Complication Index. Although five-year overall survival rates were lower in the low SMI group (34.2% vs. 43.2%), the difference was not statistically significant, likely due to the small sample size. The findings align with previous studies, suggesting that SMI is a better predictor of postoperative complications than age alone.

The study advocates for integrating SMI assessments from neck imaging into preoperative evaluations to identify patients who may benefit from comprehensive geriatric assessments (CGA). CGAs can optimize care by addressing frailty, reducing complications, and improving survival. Limitations include the lack of quality-of-life data and the small sample size. Future research should explore the long-term impact of sarcopenia and frailty on patient outcomes and healthcare costs. The study underscores the importance of tailored care for elderly HNC patients, particularly those with sarcopenia, to improve surgical outcomes and survival.",6,2.8,17.4,,,90,95,10,95,85,90,10,90,80,85,15,90

The percentage of fibrous tissue on the representative sections was evaluated using haematoxylin and eosin- and Masson?s trichrome-stained specimens.

There was a significant association between diagnosis based on 45% fibrous tissue criterion and the final pathological diagnosis. Our study showed a tendency for cortical bone perforation in OM compared to OMF and correlation between ADC and cortical bone perforation. According to the histopathological analyses, the fibrous component of each case was bimodal with 45%, which may be a criterion to distinguish between OM and OMF. Accumulating knowledge, such as significant differences in prognosis, may allow for minimal surgical treatment options based on the diagnosis according to this novel histopathological criterion.","Introduction
Odontogenic myxoma (OM) is a benign tumour that arises in the maxilla and mandible and contains collagen fibres in the myxoid stroma. 12 Odontogenic myxoma accounts for 2%–5% of all odontogenic tumours. 3456 The incidence of OM is estimated to be 0.07 per million people. 7 In contrast, odontogenic myxofibroma (OMF) is a benign tumour containing more fibrous tissue than OM. Odontogenic myxofibroma has been reported to be caused by myxomatous degeneration of odontogenic fibroma, but its aetiology remains unclear. 89

The clinical differences between OM and OMF and the clinical significance of their classification are also unclear. The 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) classification includes OM and OMF in the same category. No histopathological diagnostic indicators, including the ratio of fibrous tissue, are available to differentiate OM and OMF, and their diagnoses depend on individual pathologists.

Recurrence rates of 9.3%–26 % and 4.4%–9.52 % have been reported for OMs 1011121314 and OMFs, 151617 respectively, suggesting that OMs have a higher recurrence rate than OMFs. Recurrence rates vary greatly depending on the surgical procedure, 14 and Takahashi et al have reported that a bone safety zone of 5 mm is acceptable for OM, instead of 1 cm as reported conventionally. 18 The appropriate surgical treatments and surgical margins for OMs and OMFs remain controversial. However, only a few studies have been conducted on OMs and OMFs at a single institution.

Therefore, in this study, a clinical statistical analysis of patients with OM or OMF who were treated at our hospital was conducted. By focusing on the fibrous component of the specimens of each case, the criteria for differentiating OM from OMF were noted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the differences between OM and OMF.

Material and methods
This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our institution and was conducted in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. The requirement for informed consent was waived by the Institutional Review Board of our institution because of the retrospective design of the study.

A total of 21 patients with OMs or OMFs who underwent tumour resection from 2003 to 2022 at our hospital were included in this study. The medical records of patients treated for oral and maxillofacial problems at the hospital, were reviewed. Data were collected regarding patient age, sex, lesion location, duration of illness. Tumour size (longest diameter on computed tomography [CT]), presence of cortical bone perforation, and locularity were evaluated based on CT or panoramic radiography. Twenty cases were assessed using CT, while one case (Case No. 20) was evaluated using panoramic radiography. Surgical procedure, histopathological diagnosis, and the presence or absence of recurrence were also investigated.

To evaluate the cellularity of tumour tissues by a non-invasive method, an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was examined in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) visualised water molecule motion, quantified by the clinically calculated ADC value. DWI involved spin echo-based echoplanar imaging with fat suppression, using ten gradient b-values (0–1000 sec/mm 2 ). The ADC map was derived, and ADC values were measured by drawing the region of interest (ROI) on the map. ROIs were placed in a sectional view of the ADC map with the maximum tumour length. ADC values were measured three times, and averages were calculated for accuracy.

In re-evaluation of the histopathological findings, two oral pathologists were blinded to the final pathological diagnoses in actual clinical practice. We defined ‘representative split planes of the tumour’ as a cross-section made along the longest diameter of the tumour. These representative split planes of the tumour were generated using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue along a single axis. The FFPE was prepared in one to several blocks based on the tumour size. The percentage of fibrous tissue was evaluated in 10% increments under a 4× objective field of view using specimen of all blocks stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE) and a selective representative block stained with Masson’s trichrome (MT). Patients with divergent evaluations between the two oral pathologists were reviewed, and consensus results were obtained.

Statistical analysis
For statistical analysis, two-tailed p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. For quantitative variables, the Mann–Whitney U test was used when the hypothesis of normality was rejected; otherwise, the independent t -test was used. Fisher's exact test was used if the expected frequency of 20% or more of the cells was fewer than five; otherwise, the chi-squared test was used. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to examine the correlation between the percentage of fibrous tissue using HE- and MT-staining methods. JMP 9.0.3 (SAS Institute Inc.) was used for statistical analyses other than Fisher's exact test. Fisher’s exact test was performed using the computer program at https://aoki2.si.gunma-u.ac.jp/ezact/exact.html , based on the method reported by Mehta et al. 19

Results
Odontogenic myxomas or OMFs were examined in 21 patients (11 men, 10 women) with a mean (range) age of 41.3 (16–72) years. The clinical features of these tumours are listed in Table 1 . These conditions occurred primarily in the mandible (maxilla, n = 4; mandible, n = 17), with a median (interquartile range) duration of illness of 16 (1-45) months and a mean (range) tumour size of 45.6 (11–102) mm. Radiological assessment showed cortical bone perforation in 11 and multilocular lesion in 16. Overall, 16 patients underwent MRI, and most lesions appeared muscle-identical in intensity on T1-weighted images and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The ADC value was measured in 11 patients, and the mean ADC value was 1.79 × 10 −3 mm 2 /sec. The surgical procedures were classified into the following six categories: enucleation, 1 (4.8%); enucleation and curettage, 3 (14.3%); enucleation and peripheral osteotomy, 1 (4.8%); marginal resection, 3 (14.3%); and segmental resection, 11 (52.4%). Two patients (9.5%) underwent the dredging method, which comprised an initial deflation (marsupialisation) step, followed by enucleation and subsequent repeated separate dredging procedures. This is indicated for cases in which many small daughter cysts are scattered and difficult to resect in a single session. 20212223 Histopathological diagnoses included OMs in 11 patients and OMFs in 10. The postoperative follow-up period ranged from 6 to 184 months with no tumour recurrence except for two cases in which the dredging method was applied. A comparative analysis was conducted for eight different variables between OM and OMF ( Table 2 ). More cortical bone perforation was observed in OM than in OMF cases, without significant differences. Other significant correlations were found in location-locularity and ADC-cortical bone perforation in all OM and OMF cases ( Table 3 ).

To further investigate the histopathological status of OMs or OMFs, the percentage of fibrous tissue for the representative sections was evaluated in each patient by the same two oral pathologists using HE- and MT-stained specimens ( Fig. 1 ). A significant correlation (r = 0.86, p < 0.0001) was noted between the percentage of fibrous tissue using HE- and MT-staining methods ( Supplementary Figure , online only). OMF exhibited a higher proportion of fibrous tissue components compared with OM with a clear and statistically significant difference (p = 0.006) ( Table 4 ). The distribution of MT-staining percentage in each patient was bimodal with a border of 45% ( Fig. 2 ). Based on these results, the cut-off value for re-diagnosis of OM and OMF was set at 45% of fibrous tissue staining. Although re-diagnoses with a fibrous tissue component differed in five cases from the final pathological diagnoses, a significant association (p = 0.03) was noted between the final pathological diagnoses and re-diagnoses ( Table 4 ).

Discussion
Myxoma, first described in 1863, is a slow-growing tumour composed of a myxoid component. By contrast, myxofibroma was first described by Marcove et al 24 and is defined as a fibroma with an additional myxoid component. 89 Previous literature has shown that OM has a higher recurrence rate than OMF, 1011121314151617 although both are considered in the same category according to the WHO classification. To the best of our knowledge, only a few single-centre studies have compared OM and OMF, and the histopathological points of differentiation between the two conditions have not yet been defined. Although extended resection is often the surgical treatment of choice for OM and OMF, a less invasive treatment for OMF may be applied if differentiation is possible. Therefore, a comparative statistical analysis of the clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings in patients with OM and OMF was performed. In addition, histopathological findings on the percentage of the fibrous tissues were evaluated.

There was a trend toward more radiological cortical bone perforation in OM than in OMF cases, suggesting a higher risk of recurrence in OM ( Table 2 ), as noted in previous reports. 1011121314151617 More multilocular lesions were observed in the mandible than in the maxilla as compared with unilocular lesions ( Table 3 ), which is consistent with previous reports on odontogenic tumours. 25 However, the clinical relevance may be minor, given the scarcity of maxillary cases. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between OM and OMF in terms of locularity and ADC. The ADC value was significantly lower in all cases OM and OMF with cortical bone perforation than in those without ( Table 3 ). Performing an MRI examination depends on the condition of each lesion, but there were no associations between the presence or absence of MRI and other clinical, radiological, and histopathological variables. Regions with low ADC values correspond to hypercellular tissues, and low ADC values are visible in hypercellular tissues. 26 In regions of low ADC values, tumour cells show hypercellularity, resulting in cortical bone perforation.

Re-diagnoses by the two pathologists differed from the final pathological diagnoses in five cases, suggesting that the diagnostic criteria were dependent on each pathologist. Meanwhile, the diagnoses differentiated according to the percentage of fibrous tissue showed a strong correlation with the final diagnoses. OM diagnosed as OMF based on the 45% fibrous tissue criterion in two cases and OMF diagnosed as OM based on the 45% fibrous tissue criterion in three cases ( Table 4 ) were considered borderline conditions. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between MT-staining and HE-staining findings, suggesting the versatility of diagnosis based on staining of fibrous tissues. If both diseases had the same origin, a uniform distribution of fibrous components would be anticipated. Surprisingly, however, they exhibited a bimodal distribution with a border of 45%, indicating potential differences in their origins. The aetiologies of OM and OMF are uncertain; 172728 therefore, previous reports have often confusingly described OM and OMF as the same disease. These findings may imply disparate origins for OM and OMF. The 2022 WHO classification classifies OM as benign mesenchymal odontogenic tumours, which also include odontogenic fibroma. While OM and OMF are categorised as mesenchymal odontogenic tumours, it is conceivable that OMF shares a closer origin with odontogenic fibroma than with odontogenic myxoma, although definitive conclusions are precluded by the limited number of cases examined. A limitation of this study is that no recurrence was observed except for two cases in which the dredging method was applied, making it difficult to examine the data in terms of recurrence rate. OM and OMF are rare, and no single-centre studies have been conducted, that we know of, to examine their recurrence rates. A multicentre study is required to increase the number of patients and provide additional clinical information. Furthermore, calculating the percentage of fibrous tissue components using imaging software is expected to lead to a more accurate diagnosis, and preparations are underway for this method of analysis.

Conclusions
There was a trend toward more radiological cortical bone perforation in OM cases than in OMF cases, suggesting a higher risk of recurrence in OM. Histopathological analyses suggested that the fibrous component of each case was bimodal with 45%, which may be a criterion to distinguish between OMs and OMFs. Further studies evaluating significant differences in prognosis may allow for minimal surgical treatment options by clearly differentiating between OM and OMF based on this novel histopathological criterion, leading to preservation of function, especially in young patients.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission
This study was approved by Institutional Review Board of Tokyo Medical and Dental University (D2021-093). The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the retrospective study design.","This study aimed to objectively differentiate between odontogenic myxoma (OM) and odontogenic myxofibroma (OMF), two benign odontogenic tumors with overlapping clinical and histopathological features. OM, which accounts for 2%–5% of all odontogenic tumors, exhibits a myxoid stroma with collagen fibers and a tendency for higher recurrence, whereas OMF contains a larger fibrous tissue component. Despite being categorized together under the 2022 World Health Organization classification, their diagnostic criteria have been subjective, relying on individual pathologist judgment.

Conducted retrospectively from 2003 to 2022, the study reviewed 21 cases treated at a single institution. Clinical, radiological, and histopathological data were collected, including lesion size, locularity, cortical bone perforation, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values obtained from MRI. Importantly, the percentage of fibrous tissue was quantified using both haematoxylin and eosin and Masson’s trichrome staining. A bimodal distribution was identified with a critical cutoff at 45% fibrous tissue: lesions below this threshold were classified as OM and those above as OMF. This objective criterion correlated significantly with final pathological diagnoses, although five cases exhibited borderline features.

The findings suggest that the fibrous tissue proportion can serve as a reliable marker to distinguish OM from OMF, potentially guiding less invasive surgical approaches and improving prognostic accuracy. These results underscore the need for standardized diagnostic protocols that integrate quantitative histopathological evaluation with clinical and radiological findings to optimize patient outcomes. Overall, the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Tokyo Medical and Dental University, with informed consent waived due to its retrospective design.","This study investigates the clinical and histopathological differences between Odontogenic Myxoma (OM) and Odontogenic Myxofibroma (OMF), rare benign tumors of the jaw, aiming to refine diagnostic criteria and surgical approaches. Researchers retrospectively analyzed data from 21 patients treated at their institution between 2003 and 2022, focusing on clinical features, radiological findings, and the percentage of fibrous tissue in tumor specimens. They observed a trend towards more cortical bone perforation in OM cases, potentially indicating a higher recurrence risk. Histopathological analysis revealed a bimodal distribution of fibrous tissue content, with 45% serving as a potential cut-off for differentiating OM and OMF. The researchers found a significant association between final pathological diagnoses and the re-diagnoses based on this 45% fibrous tissue criterion. They suggest that OMF may be more closely related to odontogenic fibroma, offering a novel histopathological criterion for differentiation, potentially leading to less invasive surgical treatments for OMF, especially in young patients.","This study investigates the clinical, radiological, and histopathological differences between odontogenic myxoma (OM) and odontogenic myxofibroma (OMF), two rare benign jaw tumours. OM and OMF are classified together in the 2022 WHO classification, but their differentiation remains challenging due to a lack of clear diagnostic criteria. The study retrospectively analyzed 21 patients (11 OM, 10 OMF) treated at a single institution from 2003 to 2022, focusing on fibrous tissue content as a potential distinguishing factor.

Key findings include a trend toward more cortical bone perforation in OM cases, suggesting a higher recurrence risk compared to OMF. Histopathological analysis revealed a bimodal distribution of fibrous tissue content, with a 45% threshold effectively differentiating OM (<45% fibrous tissue) from OMF (>45% fibrous tissue). This distinction was supported by strong correlations between haematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson’s trichrome (MT) staining methods. However, re-diagnoses based on fibrous tissue content differed from original pathological diagnoses in five cases, highlighting diagnostic variability among pathologists.

Radiological analysis showed no significant differences in tumour locularity or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values between OM and OMF, though lower ADC values were associated with cortical bone perforation, indicating hypercellularity. Surgical outcomes were similar, with no recurrences except in two cases treated with the dredging method.

The study suggests that fibrous tissue content may serve as a criterion to differentiate OM from OMF, potentially guiding less invasive surgical approaches for OMF. However, the small sample size and lack of recurrence data limit broader conclusions. Future multicentre studies and imaging-based analyses are needed to validate these findings and explore prognostic differences, enabling more tailored treatments, particularly for younger patients.

In the UK the specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) has mandated dual degree (medicine and dentistry) training since 1984. 1 Although a formal, external review of OMFS training in 2008 2 recommended that specialty training should start at the beginning of the second degree, this recommendation has not yet been delivered. Instead, those dentists and doctors wishing to pursue a career in OMFS apply for their second degree as a personal, individual step in their career. For decades OMFS trainees applied through the normal university application process, competing with 18-year-old pupils who had just finished their A levels. After many years of exclusively undergraduate entry dentistry and medicine courses, there are now some ‘graduate entry’ medical and dental schools. Of graduate entry medical schools, 12 of 18 accept any degree of a 2.1 or above. These widened access to medical careers but increased competition for those with OMFS in mind. Three of the four UK graduate entry dentistry courses (Aberdeen, Kings London, and University of Central Lancaster - UCLAN) require a bioscience as the first degree, and the Kings ‘Dental Programme for Medical Graduates’ (DPMG) requires medicine.

Medical and dental schools are very independent and have proved reluctant to change their entry criteria to help the specialty of OMFS. Informal facilitation has happened sporadically. For seven years in the 1980s the Medical Dean in Leicester Medical school offered two places in a 30 month programme for OMFS trainees to study and complete the registerable medical qualifications of the Royal College of Surgeons in England (called the conjoint exams these were the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons - MRCS and the Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians - LRCP). This route stopped when the exams ceased in 1999.

Diplomacy, persistence and, in some cases, luck has generated ‘dedicated’ OMFS places for second degree studies. Selection for some of these places have direct involvement with OMFS trainers and specialists 3 . Other medical and dental schools have OMFS places but no direct involvement or contribution from the specialty of OMFS in the selection to these places.

One of the first OMFS specific second-degree places in the UK started in Birmingham in 1985 with two places for candidates chosen by a panel of OMFS trainers. Availability of these places attracted dentists aiming for OMFS to apply for Senior House Officer (SHO) posts in Birmingham (nowadays these posts are called Dental Core Training or DCT posts). Seeing the positive impact for the Birmingham OMFS Unit of having OMFS controlled second degree places, other OMFS departments negotiated places at their local medical school. Medical schools with OMFS places now include Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry (from 1996), Manchester (from 2006), Leeds, Glasgow, Kings and most recently Liverpool (from 2015) and York/Hull. The numbers applying to these OMFS controlled places and numbers given places are discussed in another paper. 3

For OMFS surgeons coming from a medicine first background the quantum change was the three-year King’s College London Dental Programme for Medical Graduates (DPMG) which started in 2007 with the first graduates in 2010. 4 The creation of graduate entry dental schools in Peninsula and Central Lancashire/Liverpool in 2010 also created new routes/locations for OMFS trainees but these were impacted by the misinterpretation of European Union law by the dental regulator. 5

The purpose of this paper is to review the second-degree locations of those currently or recently on the OMFS specialist list and those currently in OMFS specialty training.

Method
In January 2024, the OMFS specialist list was obtained from the General Medical Council using a Freedom of Information request. The second-degree universities of OMFS specialists and trainees were assembled by combining this list with a database of current and past OMFS trainees/consultants and then cross-referencing these data with the General Dental Council’s Dental Register. For some trainees who first degree was medicine and who were not currently on the Dental Register, a direct contact was made.

For many of those whose second degree was in London, older records on the medical and dental registers does not separate into the different schools within London, simply listing ‘University of London’.

The data were then tabulated and analysed using Microsoft Excel and WinStat® (R. Fitch Software).

Results
Of 614 surgeons on the OMFS specialist list, the location of their second-degree could be ascertained in 582 cases. To this were added the second-degree location of 80 retired consultants, making a total of 662 specialists whose second-degree location was known. Of 158 OMFS trainees, the location of their second degrees could be ascertained in 156. The study group consisted of 818 specialists and specialty trainees in OMFS whose second degree was known.

Dentistry was the second degree of 129 (16%) and medicine for 689 (84%). Of the dentistry second group 31 (24%) were female and 98 (76%) male, compared with the medicine second group of whom 74 (11%) were female and 618 (89%) male. Considering the grade of surgeon, for dentistry second there were 79 (61%) specialists and 50 (39%) specialty trainees. For medicine second it was 583 (85%) specialists and 106 (15%) specialty trainees.

This group of OMFS trainees and specialists is substantially the same group whose demographics and gender were described in detail in other papers. 16 The first degree location has also been described and analysed 7 along with immigration to training and consultants posts in the UK. 8

Location of second-degree dentistry for medicine first OMFS trainees
For those whose second degree was dentistry, London was the top location with 81 (63%) followed by Mainland Europe 11 (9%), Ireland 7 (5%), Indian/Pakistan/Sri Lanka 7 (5%), Liverpool 5 (4%) and Glasgow 4 (3%). All but one of those whose second degree was in Mainland Europe were doctors whose first (medical) degree was also in Mainland Europe. The full list is shown in Table 1 , in order of frequency.

Of note there are three UK dental schools through which no past or current OMFS trainees have obtained their second degree – Birmingham, Dundee, and Newcastle. There is currently a second degree OMFS trainee studying dentistry in Newcastle whose degree will last the full 5 years (they were not able to negotiate any reduction in the course length based on their medical degree).

There is more diversity in the second-degree location of medical studies for the ‘dentistry first’ group.

The larger numbers of dentistry first OMFS specialists and trainees means that the overall figures for all OMFS specialists and trainees are very similar to this dentistry first group. London is the top location overall. The few other locations whose overall ranking is changed within the ‘all’ rankings when their second-degree numbers are increased by the addition of dentistry courses, are highlighted in bold in Table 2 .

Second degree locations - overall
The combined second-degree group (medicine and dentistry) are shown in the right column of Table 2 . The most common location for second degrees was London with 287 (35%) of OMFS STs and consultants completing degrees there. The next largest source was Birmingham University 67 (8%), then Cardiff 51 (6%), Manchester 45 (6%), Ireland 42 (5%), Mainland Europe 38 (5%), Leeds 27 (3%), Newcastle 26 (3%), Glasgow 26 (3%), Bristol 24 (3%), Aberdeen 20 (2%) and Liverpool 20 (2%).

Figure 1 is a histogram generated to show how the second-degree numbers of those studying at universities in London and those studying outside London are changing with time. There is a trend toward more OMFS trainees obtaining their second degree in London, which is significant using the Chi-squared test <0.05.

Discussion
This paper is a retrospective analysis of where current and past OMFS specialists and current OMFS trainees obtained their second degree. It covers a long period that includes a period when no OMFS trainers were involved in selection for places at medical or dental schools. It is difficult to make strong conclusions from these evolving data.

In earlier papers 91011 when the vast majority of trainees were dentistry first, about half of those entering second degrees on an ‘OMFS ticket’ did not continue into the specialty. A recent presentation at the BAOMS Annual Scientific Meeting and subsequent paper 3 shows that second degree studies continue to be a popular option for young dentists and doctors. These case studies of OMFS controlled second degree places also show that in recent years more than half of second-degree students are deciding not to pursue careers in OMFS. This movement of dual degree trainees away from OMFS applied to both medicine first and dentistry first trainees with a combined ‘success’ rate of 42% (133 of 316).

All trainees value geographical stability, even across shorter specialty training programmes. 12 With a predominance of second degree locations of both types being in London, there is a geographical imbalance between second degree locations and OMFS ST training rotations and consultant posts. There is a recognition that trainees tend to stay where they train, which has led to a review of training locations to address health inequalities in England. 13

Figure 1 shows that an increasing proportion of OMFS trainees are acquiring their second degree in London. An increasing proportion of OMFS trainees are medicine first 1 and the fact that most of this group complete the Kings London DPMG programme contributes to this change. Figure 2 shows that an increasing proportion of OMFS trainees accept ST posts in the same region where they studied for their second degree. This is further evidence 141516 that geographical stability is increasingly valued by trainees in our specialty.

The format of some dental and medicine courses 7 allow a shorter second degree course at the same university. This is more likely when the course structure of the first degree is the more traditional pre-clinical/clinical format. 17 The location of these traditional courses may also contribute to the geographical imbalance of where OMFS trainees complete their second degree.

The authors hope this information will be useful for all stakeholders who are involved in supporting 1819 and planning 121620212223 the OMFS workforce. Recent papers have highlighted concerns around OMFS specialty training application ratios and fill rates. 162425 There does not appear to be a lack of interest in studying for second degree or of dual degree OMFS trainees applying for ST1 run-through posts 16

Traditionally, candidates applied for their second degree as an individual career step rather than through a standardized pathway, despite a 2008 review recommending earlier specialty training integration. The evolution of graduate entry courses in both medicine and dentistry has broadened access but also intensified competition, with many institutions maintaining entry criteria that favor traditional qualifications.

Data were collected in January 2024 using a Freedom of Information request from the General Medical Council, cross-referenced with the General Dental Council register and additional direct contacts. The final cohort comprised 818 individuals—662 specialists and 156 trainees—with clear records of their second-degree locations. Among these, 84% obtained a second degree in medicine and 16% in dentistry. London was the most common training location, accounting for 35% of all second degrees, followed by Birmingham, Cardiff, Manchester, and Ireland, with further diversity noted in non-London regions.

The analysis revealed significant geographical trends: an increasing proportion of OMFS trainees are now studying in London, and many remain in the region for their subsequent specialty training posts. This geographical stability suggests that where candidates train influences their long-term practice location, thereby contributing to regional imbalances in the OMFS workforce. The study also highlights that less than half (42%) of second-degree candidates ultimately pursue a career in OMFS, emphasizing the need for careful workforce planning and further review of training pathways.","This research paper analyzes the second-degree locations of UK oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) specialists and trainees, examining the geographical distribution of medical and dental qualifications within the specialty. Data from the General Medical Council and General Dental Council were analyzed to determine where 818 OMFS surgeons obtained their second degrees. The study found that 84% obtained medicine as a second degree, with 16% completing dentistry.

London was the predominant location for second degrees (35%), followed by Birmingham, Cardiff, and Manchester. A trend towards more trainees acquiring their second degree in London and remaining in that region for training was identified. This geographical imbalance is further compounded by course structures allowing shorter second degree programs at the same university.

The authors highlight that over half of those pursuing a second degree, even those in OMFS-controlled places, ultimately do not continue in the specialty. The study concludes that the findings are valuable for workforce planning and addressing concerns about OMFS specialty training application rates, underscoring the importance of geographical stability for trainees.","This study examines the second-degree locations of oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) specialists and trainees in the UK, focusing on where they obtained their medical or dental degrees. OMFS requires dual qualifications (medicine and dentistry), but training pathways have evolved without standardized support for second-degree studies. The research analyzed data from 818 OMFS specialists and trainees, identifying trends in second-degree locations and their impact on training and career paths.

Key findings reveal that 84% of OMFS professionals pursued medicine as their second degree, while 16% chose dentistry. London was the most common location for second-degree studies (35%), followed by Birmingham (8%) and Cardiff (6%). For those with dentistry as their second degree, London dominated (63%), while medicine-first trainees often studied in London (30%) or Birmingham (10%). Notably, some UK dental schools, such as Birmingham, Dundee, and Newcastle, had no OMFS trainees completing second degrees there.

The study highlights a trend toward trainees remaining in the same region for specialty training where they completed their second degree, particularly in London. This geographical stability is increasingly valued by trainees but contributes to regional imbalances in OMFS workforce distribution. Additionally, the research notes that a significant proportion of dual-degree trainees do not pursue OMFS careers, with only 42% continuing into the specialty.

This study looked at variables predicting major complications and flap failure in a single institution with the aim of determining whether the QOMS dataset adequately captures the appropriate data points. A prospective database of head and neck flap procedures and associated postoperative complications has been maintained in the maxillofacial surgery department since August 2009 up to August 2022 (n=1327). A total of 25 putative risk variables were extracted from the health records for each patient. The outcomes of interest were total flap failure and major complications. Independent predictors of flap failure were recipient site (sinonasal/anterior skull base), previous major surgery, previous major surgery and radiotherapy, and flap selection. For major complications ACE-27 comorbidity score, flap type, use of tracheostomy, elevated preoperative plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and flap selection were independently predictive.

QOMS is therefore likely to adequately risk stratify patients based upon currently collected variables.","Introduction
An important component in mitigating adverse events in surgery is recognition of what constitutes a high-risk clinical scenario. This requires that a surgical team can readily access data describing its performance with variables that allow the risk-stratification of patients and procedures. Furthermore, access to comparative data that describes the performance of other teams in similar scenarios may enable selection of the optimal surgical plan. The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS) Quality and Outcomes in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (QOMS) project aims to achieve both goals. 1 The aim of this study is to identify the variables that predict flap failure and major complications in patients undergoing head and neck free flap reconstructive surgery in a single centre and determine whether the current QOMS Reconstructive Audit dataset is likely to correctly identify higher-risk clinical scenarios.

Methods
Since August 2009 a prospective audit of adverse events after head and neck free flap reconstructive surgery has been maintained by the maxillofacial head and neck surgical oncology division at the Institute of Neurological Sciences, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow. Complication events are recorded at a weekly divisional meeting. At regular intervals this dataset has been updated to include putative risk variables. The most recent update includes all patients up to August 2022 (n = 1327). The principal outcomes of interest were total flap failure and major complications (defined by a Clavien-Dindo 2 score of IIIa, IIIb, IV, or V).

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were analysed using the Student’s t -test or Mann-Whitney U test and categorical variables using either the chi squared or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Binary logistic regression was used to obtain hazard ratios for categorical variables. To identify independent prognostic variables multivariate regression analysis was performed entering all variables significant at the p < 0.05 level. Where a combination of continuous and categorical variables was required to be modelled linear regression was deployed, otherwise logistic regression was used. All analyses were performed using SPSS 28 (IBM).

Continuous variables assessed
Age in years, body mass index (BMI kg/m 2 ), preoperative peripheral blood white cell count (WCC), preoperative peripheral blood haemoglobin estimation (Hb g/l), platelet count (Plt), Preoperative serum albumin (sALb), and C-reactive protein (CRP) estimation.

Categorical variables assessed
Gender, stage, American Society of Anesthesiology score (ASA), Adult comorbidity evaluation-27 score (ACE-27), WHO/ECOG performance status (PS), shortness of breath (SOB) at rest, SOB on mild exertion, diabetes, occlusive vascular disease (previous diagnosis of coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease), previous major head and neck surgery, previous head and neck (chemo)radiotherapy, smoking status, alcohol consumption, Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) score, type of flap, requirement for more than one flap, tracheostomy, and recipient head and neck site.

Results
Flap failures
A total of 63 patients (4.75%) experienced flap failure. On univariate analysis, previous major head and neck surgery, previous radiotherapy, weight loss >10%, flap deployed, and recipient site were all significant ( Table 1 ). Further exploration of the influence of previous treatment for head and neck cancer demonstrated that previous major surgery and adjuvant treatment were most associated with flap failure, whereas non-surgical treatment alone was not influential ( Table 2 ). The sinonasal/anterior skull base was found to be the recipient site most at risk of associated flap failure. On multivariate regression analysis, the recipient site, previous surgery, (chemo)radiotherapy, and flap selection were independent predictors of flap loss ( Table 3 ).

Major complications (Clavien-Dindo III+)
Categorical variables significantly associated with major complications on univariate analysis are shown in Table 4 . For the recipient site (with the oral cavity/oropharynx as reference) the hypopharynx and larynx had a significantly higher likelihood of major complications and the parotid/lateral skull base/scalp/calvarium a lower risk. For flap selection, the radial forearm flap was used as reference and both DCIA and scapular flaps were associated with major complications. A non-significant trend with the fibular flap was observed. Of the continuous putative variables, only elevated preoperative CRP (>10 ng/ml) was associated with a higher likelihood of a major postoperative complication ( Table 5 ).

Unscheduled return to the operating theatre (URTT) had the same predictive categorical variables but with the addition of previous major head and neck surgery (HR 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0 to 1.8, p = 0.031) ( supplemental data , online only). Independent predictors of URTT were previous radiotherapy (HR 2.1 (95% CI 1.39 to 3.16), p < 0.001) and requirement for tracheostomy (HR 3.18 (95% CI 1.81 to 5.57), p < 0.001).

Discussion
Postoperative major complications, particularly flap loss, represent significant adverse experiences for the affected patient, their family, the surgical team, and the institution which must allocate additional resources to resolving what maybe a difficult problem. For this reason, a body of literature exists seeking to identify predictive factors and so allow appropriate mitigation. 345 This study is focused upon those predictive factors known to the surgical team prior to surgery.

Resectional surgery involving the sinonasal region and anterior skull base was found to be an important risk factor for flap failure. We are not aware of any previous literature identifying this recipient site as being at higher risk and this could therefore be an observation unique to our institution. Flap selection may be part of the explanation with selection of myo-osseous and myocutaneous truncal flaps prominent among flap failures. These are indicated in the setting of total maxillectomy with or without orbital exenteration but are often bulky and volume matching can be problematic. We speculate that the requirement for a long-tunnelled pedicle is also contributory. The use of a wide subcutaneous tunnel raised at the interface of subcutaneous fat and the superficial musculoaponeurotic region with anastomosis to facial vessels has been widely deployed. Where the anastomosis is in the neck, inferior to the lower border of the mandible, this point becomes relatively fixed in relation to head movement. Fibrosis results in further fixity of the vascular pedicle within its tunnel. The resultant repeated tension on the blood supply to the distal elements might be an explanation for the delayed failures (beyond 10 days) we have observed but emphasise that this is speculative. Nevertheless, it may be prudent to shorten the tunnel length and form anastomoses as close as feasible to the recipient defect. Where resection extends into the masticatory space routing the pedicle on the medial aspect of the mandible, through the parapharyngeal space, provides a more direct and shorter route to the recipient defect. It is noteworthy that interpositional vein grafts were seldom deployed in this patient cohort.

The importance of matching a surgical plan to patient characteristics is given credence by a report from Van Genechten and Batstone. 6 These authors described 173 patients undergoing head and neck bone free flap reconstructions (84 fibular, 43 iliac crest, 32 scapular, and 10 osseocutaneous radial) with no complete flap failure. Flap selection was influenced by patients’ ages implying a high degree of clinical acumen in matching a procedure to a specific patient.

Ho et al noted a temporal reduction in flap failure and reduced rate of return to theatre when comparing more contemporary time intervals with earlier cohorts in a single UK institution implying institutional learning. 7 As part of our local quality assurance process, outcomes have been measured using control charts in cohorts of 100 ( supplemental data , online only). It is disappointing that we have not observed a similar temporal relationship. This is despite the increasing use of implantable dopplers for flap monitoring in the latter half of the study period. Even within one institution, it is apparent that surgeons’ preferences are not easily influenced by relative experiences. The reasons for that are speculative and include ineffective peer review and perhaps a reflexive conservatism in the face of adverse outcomes. When a surgical solution to a problem is effective most of the time, when faced with adverse events it is difficult to adopt a less familiar solution even though the experiences of other surgeons suggest it might be more reliable. The ‘stick to what we know’ mindset is seen as a less risky proposition despite data to the contrary. The BAOMS QOMS initiative will deliver a much richer data seam demonstrating surgical variation in outcomes between surgical teams and institutions as well as further clarifying higher risk scenarios. An important challenge for the initiative is using that data in a way which influences surgeons’ decision making to maximise success. There has been considerable overlap of surgical teams over the study period with personnel changes and it has not therefore been possible to draw any conclusions with respect to variation in outcomes across surgical teams.

The most important contributor to the patient group who experienced a major complication (Clavien-Dindo III+) were those who had an unscheduled return to theatre (n = 351, Clavien-Dindo IIIb) to resolve a wound problem, which was usually a whole salivary leak into the neck. 8 It seems likely that tracheostomy (as an independent predictor of unscheduled return to theatre) is a surrogate for a procedure that involves the oral cavity and pharynx and therefore prone to whole saliva leak into the neck. However, the use of a tracheostomy is independently predictive of postoperative lower respiratory tract infection ( supplementary data , online only) in a proportion of whom critical care intervention is required. How clinicians should respond will depend upon institutional characteristics. We speculate that there is likely to be a trade-off between avoiding tracheostomy-related lower respiratory tract infection and risking rare, but catastrophic, anoxic brain injury from airway occlusion. Admission to intensive care for 12 to 24 hours for postoperative ventilation via an endotracheal tube has been shown to be safe and effective in a relatively small series of patients and may be a sensible alternative where critical care resources are available. 9 The decision to use a tracheostomy was at the discretion of the surgical team throughout and based upon the perceived risk of airway compromise. Tracheostomy use was consistent across the surgical teams.

Previous radiotherapy has been associated with major complications across several publications. The late effects of radiotherapy are well documented with progressive soft tissue fibrosis, associated loss of elasticity and depleted microcirculation along with long segment occlusive vascular disease. 1011 It is frequently necessary to replace external neck skin to allow tension-free wound closure increasing surgical complexity. Post-irradiation detrimental effects on wound healing (decreased wound strength, decreased collagen deposition, and decreased angiogenesis) 12 often result in dehiscence between the flap and the mucosal interface and, in our experience, salivary leaks are a frequent consequence. Appropriate sizing of skin paddle repairs may mitigate this ensuring tension-free closure and deeper tissue contact at the interface between the flap and the recipient site. In contrast to our findings, Ishimaru et al demonstrated previous radiotherapy to be independently predictive of flap failure in a Japanese cohort of patients. 3 The consequences of irradiation on recipient blood vessels are long established, with irradiated vessels having significantly greater wall thickness and higher incidence of intimal separation. Furthermore, fibrin deposition, microthrombus, and endothelial cell dehiscence are more frequently present 13 as well as atherosclerosis. It is therefore perplexing that we did not see increased flap failure associated with previous neck irradiation alone but only when combined with previous neck surgery. We speculate that the increased fibrosis associated with surgery (and adjuvant treatment) combined with vessel depletion are more important than direct effects of radiotherapy on medium and large vessels. In contrast to the findings in the national Japanese study, 3 we were not able to identify any association between diabetes mellitus, occlusive vascular disease. and flap failure.

Patient comorbidity (higher ACE-27) as well as activated systemic inflammation at the time of surgery are associated with major complications. Optimisation of patient physiology in the preoperative period seems logical and further investigation of prehabilitation strategies warranted.

The QOMS reconstructive audit has incorporated risk adjustment tools as part of its design. The limited data presented here demonstrate the importance of this. Patient factors, disease site, and flap selection are all important components. Reassuringly the QOMS dataset collects all data-points identified in this cohort as significantly associated with adverse events except for preoperative CRP ( supplemental table , online only). Incorporating CRP into the dataset will come at increased cost to the healthcare system. However, the use of platelet to neutrophil ratio would be cost effective since these markers of activated innate immunity are routinely measured preoperatively. Stevens et al found an elevated preoperative platelet count to be associated with flap failure. 5

Conclusions
Flap failure and major complications associated with head and neck reconstructive surgery are driven by interactions between patient physiology and comorbidity at/around the time of surgery, location of disease, and surgeon choices. There is limited scope to modify the first of these factors and none whatsoever for the second, so it is therefore incumbent on the surgical team to develop a surgical plan with the greatest likelihood of success based on accurate data describing prior experience and outcomes relative to peers. In short, the use of data to inform optimal decision making for a given patient with a specific disease process is vital. It is therefore the authors’ opinion that participation in the QOMS audits should now be the necessary standard of care for maxillofacial surgeons performing reconstructive surgery in the United Kingdom.

Recognizing high‐risk clinical scenarios is crucial for tailoring surgical strategies. The study prospectively audited 1327 patients undergoing free flap reconstruction at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, from August 2009 to August 2022. Data were systematically collected at weekly meetings and updated periodically with potential risk variables. Primary outcomes included total flap failure and major complications defined by Clavien-Dindo scores IIIa to V.

Statistical analysis utilized univariate and multivariate regression models to identify significant risk factors. On univariate analysis, flap failure was significantly associated with previous major head and neck surgery, prior radiotherapy, weight loss exceeding 10%, type of flap deployed, and recipient site, with the sinonasal/anterior skull base region demonstrating heightened risk. Multivariate analysis confirmed that recipient site, combined previous surgery and (chemo)radiotherapy, and non-radial forearm flap selection independently predicted flap failure. Major complications were linked to higher ACE-27 comorbidity scores, tracheostomy use, certain flap types, and elevated preoperative C-reactive protein levels.

The findings underscore that patient physiology, disease location, and surgical choices collectively influence outcomes. The QOMS audit not only validates its dataset by capturing these risk factors, but also serves as a tool for benchmarking and refining surgical decision-making. The project advocates for the mandatory participation of maxillofacial surgeons in such audits to enhance patient outcomes through evidence-based practice. Overall, outcomes improved.","This study aimed to identify variables predicting flap failure and major complications in head and neck free flap reconstructive surgery at a single center, assessing the QOMS Reconstructive Audit dataset's ability to risk-stratify.

Results showed a 4.75% flap failure rate. Previous major head and neck surgery, previous radiotherapy, weight loss >10%, flap type, and recipient site were significant factors. Multivariate analysis identified recipient site (sinonasal/anterior skull base), previous surgery with (chemo)radiotherapy, and flap selection as independent predictors of flap loss. For major complications, significant factors were recipient site (hypopharynx/larynx), ACE-27 score, performance status, previous radiotherapy, flap type, tracheostomy, and elevated preoperative CRP. Multivariate analysis identified ACE-27, flap type, tracheostomy, and preoperative CRP as independent predictors of major complications. The QOMS dataset captures most significant data points, suggesting its utility in risk assessment.

Key findings identified several risk factors: previous major head and neck surgery, prior radiotherapy, weight loss >10%, flap type, and recipient site (particularly sinonasal/anterior skull base) were independently associated with flap failure. Multivariate analysis confirmed these factors, alongside elevated preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP), as significant predictors of major complications.

The study highlights the importance of preoperative risk stratification, emphasizing patient comorbidities (ACE-27 score), surgical site, and flap selection in predicting adverse outcomes. Notably, tracheostomy use was linked to higher complication rates, likely due to salivary leaks and respiratory infections.

Maxillofacial trauma often presents with significant preoperative oedema, posing multifaceted challenges for maxillofacial surgeons. 1 Such oedema complicates surgical interventions by obscuring anatomical landmarks, leading to potential oversights of additional traumas, and impairing optimal healing postoperatively. 2 While steroids have emerged as a potential remedy to this predicament, their perioperative administration is double-edged. While they effectively ameliorate oedema, they also theoretically elevate the risk of postoperative infections. 3

Current clinical practice is marked by a palpable absence of concrete guidelines governing the perioperative use of steroids in maxillofacial trauma, be it concerning their nature, dosing, or timing. 4 Surgeons often lean on institutional protocols or subjective clinical judgments. Criteria such as the presence or absence of infection signs, the injury's timeline, and the oedema's severity frequently guide these decisions. 5 Relying on overt infection signs such as pus might not be the most proactive approach, as these manifestations often surface late in the infection's progression. 6

Biomarkers, in recent times, have shown the potential to be early sentinels for infections and inflammation. Procalcitonin (PCT), in particular, has been highlighted as a sensitive indicator of bacterial infections, often rising even before traditional markers of sepsis in a similar way to leukocyte counts. 7 Complementing this, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) act as broader markers for inflammation. IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, rapidly increases following trauma, signalling inflammation, and aiding in immune response regulation. IL-10, in contrast, is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that arises after IL-6, playing a critical role in modulating this response to prevent tissue damage. This balance between IL-6 and IL-10 is essential for understanding the severity of trauma and the effectiveness of interventions such as steroids, which influence these interleukins’ levels and, consequently, the patient’s inflammatory status and recovery. 8

Given this confluence of challenges and opportunities, our study is underpinned by the hypothesis that a combination of these inflammation and infection biomarkers could serve as prognostic indicators for infection in maxillofacial trauma patients. By leveraging these biomarkers’ predictive potential, we aim to sculpt more informed and evidence-driven guidelines for the perioperative use of steroids in this patient cohort. 9

Material and methods
A prospective observational study was conducted at the oral and maxillofacial surgery unit of a tertiary public hospital in India, designated as a Level 1 trauma centre from January 2019 to April 2022 including all the patients >18 years old presenting with facial trauma during the study duration in the single unit of maxillofacial surgery, irrespective of the presence of oedema. Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional ethics committee (No. Dean/2019/EC/1725). Patients already on current steroid treatment, those with contraindications to corticosteroids (such as peptic ulcer or warfarin therapy), traumatic head injury, pre-existing infection foci, immunocompromised status, history of hepatic or renal failure, presentation >48 hours post-injury were excluded from the study.

Patients were randomised into two groups using computer-generated random number tables in Group A (steroid group) and Group B (non-steroid group). Group A patients were administered 10 mg intravenous dexamethasone at the time of presentation (after group allocation) and subsequently every eight hours over a 24-hour period. In Group B no steroids were given. All patients received a 1.5 gm dose of ceftriaxone + sulbactam one hour preoperatively and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in aseptic conditions.

All patients had facial computed tomographic (CT) scans to confirm the preoperative diagnosis, site of fractures, number of fractures and categorisation as midface, lower face, or panfacial fractures. The patients were evaluated by two independent observers for oedema at the time of presentation and at 24 hours following surgery using a visual analogue scale, classifying as Mild (Grade 1), Moderate (Grade 2), or Severe (Grade 3). 10 Both intra-rater and inter-rater reliabilities were calculated to ensure consistency in observations. Peripheral blood (5 ml) was drawn from both groups at the time of presentation (before group allocation). This sample was used for the immediate analysis of procalcitonin (PCT) levels. The PCT concentrations ranged from 0.05-50 ng/ml. Readings below 0.05 ng/ml were reported as ↓ 0.05 ng/ml, while those above were reported as ↑ 0.05 ng/ml. Subsequent blood samples were collected from both groups 30 minutes before incision, then subsequently at eight hours, 16 hours, and 24 hours following surgery. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were determined using Quantikine Human ELISA IL-6 and IL-10 kits.

Reduction of oedema and rate of infection in both groups were considered to be primary outcomes. The patients were assessed for reduction of postoperative oedema in maxillofacial trauma patients, as assessed by the visual analogue scale. The two groups were compared for levels of PCT, IL-6, and IL-10 and their predictive role for the use of steroids.

Data processing employed SPSS software (version 23.0, IBM Corp). The chi squared test and Fischer's exact test assessed categorical parameters. Group mean differences utilised the student’s t test. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined optimal sensitivity and specificity cut-offs. A p-value threshold of <0.05 defined statistical significance.

Results
Eighty patients who had sustained maxillofacial trauma within 48 hours, were evaluated for potential study inclusion. The final cohort consisted of 44 patients in Group A and 36 in Group B. Patients in Group A had a mean (SD) age of 28.52 (7.09) years, while those in Group B had a mean (SD) age of 28.42 (5.51) years. Both groups were similar to each other in comparison of mean duration of presentation at the trauma centre, gender distribution, type of fracture, and mean duration of wait before surgery ( Table 1 ).

In terms of initial presentation, both Groups A and B had a similar distribution of mild, moderate, and severe oedema. At 24 hours the steroid group has significantly less oedema, with 25 patients in Group A showing a significant decrease to Grade I (mild) oedema, in contrast to the 10 patients in Group B (p = 0.034) ( Table 2 ).

On comparison of oedema with levels of Il-6 and IL-10, we found that IL-6 serum levels were analogous for both groups in mild and moderate oedema categories across all timelines (30 min, eight hours, 16 hours, and 24 hours) following surgery. However, in cases with severe oedema, Group A had significantly lower IL-6 levels at 24 hours than Group B (p = 0.024). Interestingly, IL-10 levels were consistently higher in Group A for all oedema grades across the examined timelines ( Fig. 1 ).

We observed a higher risk of infection with steroid use. Group A showed 20 patients (0.25) with positive wound cultures markedly higher than the three patients (0.056) in Group B, suggesting a statistically significant relationship (p = 0.001). On subgroup analysis and correlation with PCT we found that among patients with PCT levels <0.05 ng/ml time of presentation, three out of 12 in Group A were culture positive, as opposed to the significantly higher 17 out of 32 with PCT levels >0.05 ng/ml at presentation (p = 0.039) ( Table 3 ). Out of 20 patients in Group A 10 had suture dehiscence, seven patients had surgical site infections managed with antibiotics and anti-infective mouth washes and three patients had plate exposure with wound dehiscence managed by plate removal, wound closure, and antibiotics.

The mean (SD) blood loss in Group A was 105.67 (27.7) ml and was less compared with 145.7 (36.8) ml in Group B (p = 0.05). Similarly, the mean operating time was lesser in Group A was 90.6 (30.6) minutes compared to 118.7 (25) minutes in Group B (p = 0.001).

Discussion
In the cohort of patients evaluated following maxillofacial trauma, the results demonstrate that perioperative use of steroids, as seen in Group A, led to a marked decrease in oedema. This significant reduction was evident when 25 patients in Group A showed a drop to Grade I (mild) oedema as compared with just 10 patients in Group B. In contrast, however, Group A displayed an increased risk of postoperative infections, evidenced by 20 patients (0.25) in this group testing positive in wound cultures as opposed to a mere three patients (0.056) in Group B.

Perioperative corticosteroids are recognised as potent anti-inflammatory agents and have seen an uptick in their clinical applications. Yet, their consistent use is not standardised, mainly due to continued threat of surgical site infections (SSI). 1112 Our findings resonate with this apprehension, revealing a heightened infection rate in Group A ( Table 3 ).

Growing evidence underscores the utility of Procalcitonin (PCT) as an indicator for both localised and systemic bacterial infections. 13 In comparison with C-reactive protein and culture sensitivity tests, PCT offers a more expedient and reliable insight. 1314 Typical physiological levels in serum are <0.1 ng/ml (usually <0.05 ng/ml), but these can elevate drastically in the context of systemic bacterial infections. 12 Our observations reinforce this perspective, showing that patients with PCT levels >0.05 ng/ml in Group A had an increased likelihood of infections ( Table 3 ).

Studies have highlighted IL-6 as a pro-inflammatory marker that surges following traumatic injury and is counteracted by a rise in IL-10, an anti-inflammatory marker. 1516 The modulating effects of steroids on IL-6 and IL-10, as we found, are supported by the literature, wherein IL-6, a pro-inflammatory marker, was suppressed in cases with severe oedema. Whereas IL-10, an anti-inflammatory marker, we found it to be augmented in the steroid group compared to non-steroid group. This effect can explain the observed reduced oedema in our steroid group.

Our results showed that intraoperative bleeding and operation time were both significantly reduced in the Group A (steroid group) as compared with the Group B. Moreover, surgical field visibility was significantly improved in the steroid group. A study by Hwang et al reported reduced operative time and blood loss in patients receiving steroids is possibly due to increased spastic reactivity of smooth muscle and heightened effects of endogenous adrenaline and noradrenaline, affecting vascular constriction in microcirculation, 17 but these benefits are intriguing.

Hence there has been ongoing debate regarding the merits and demerits of use of steroids in maxillofacial trauma. 1118 Reduction of oedema is key in maxillofacial trauma but potentially perceived benefits are speculative rather than evidence based. 18 The findings of the current study have demonstrated that although patients with elevated PCT levels before surgery showed signs of infection, their elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-10 presented a challenge to surgeons in terms of deciding how best to manage maxillofacial swelling while avoiding complications. Therefore, it will be advantageous for these individuals to take a combination of anti-inflammatory drugs and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Conclusions
In patients with maxillofacial trauma, steroids effectively reduce swelling but may increase the risk of postoperative infections. Elevated levels of procalcitonin (PCT) have been identified as predictors of postoperative wound infections, suggesting that patients with high PCT levels should be cautious with the use of steroids. Furthermore, the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 during the perioperative period correlate with the severity of oedema, helping to identify patients who are likely to experience significant swelling.

Maxillofacial trauma is complicated by significant preoperative swelling that obscures anatomical landmarks and may lead to overlooked injuries and compromised healing. While steroids have shown promise in reducing inflammation, their use raises concerns about an increased incidence of wound infections. To address this, the study was conducted as a prospective observational trial at a tertiary public hospital in India between January 2019 and April 2022, enrolling patients over 18 years with facial trauma. Patients were randomly assigned to either Group A (steroid group, n=44) receiving intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg at presentation and every eight hours for 24 hours) or Group B (non-steroid group, n=36) who did not receive steroids. All patients received standard prophylactic antibiotics and underwent open reduction and internal fixation. Preoperative and serial postoperative measurements of biomarkers—procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10)—were performed to assess inflammation and predict infection risk. The findings demonstrated that steroids significantly reduced postoperative oedema, improved surgical field visibility, decreased blood loss, and shortened operative time. However, the steroid group exhibited a higher rate of postoperative infections, particularly in patients with elevated preoperative PCT levels. The study concludes that while steroids effectively manage swelling in maxillofacial trauma, careful consideration of infection risk is warranted, and the use of biomarkers may guide more evidence-based perioperative management. Future research should refine steroid protocols to optimize overall patient outcomes.","This study investigates the perioperative use of steroids in maxillofacial trauma patients, a practice complicated by the balance between reducing oedema and increasing infection risk. The researchers hypothesized that a combination of inflammatory and infection biomarkers could predict infection, guiding steroid use. Eighty patients with facial trauma were enrolled, with one group receiving intravenous dexamethasone and the other serving as a control. Procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels were measured at various time points. Steroid use significantly reduced oedema but increased postoperative wound infections. Elevated PCT levels at presentation were associated with a higher risk of infection in the steroid group. IL-6 levels correlated with oedema severity, while IL-10 levels were consistently higher in the steroid group. The steroid group also experienced reduced intraoperative bleeding and operation time. The study concludes that while steroids effectively reduce swelling, caution is needed due to the increased infection risk, especially in patients with elevated PCT levels.","This study investigates the perioperative use of steroids in maxillofacial trauma patients, focusing on their impact on postoperative oedema and infection risk.

Both groups underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) under aseptic conditions, with oedema severity assessed using a visual analogue scale. Biomarkers such as procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured to evaluate infection and inflammation.

Results showed that Group A (steroid group) experienced significantly reduced oedema at 24 hours post-surgery compared to Group B.

Decompressive craniectomy (DC), which is the surgical procedure of partial removal of the cranial bones, is commonly employed as a neurological emergency to decrease cerebral oedema and intractable intracranial hypertension in patients with severe head injuries with intracranial bleeds and middle cerebral artery infarcts/strokes. 12 Cranioplasty (CP) aims to restore the residual cranial defect created post-decompressive craniectomy. The role of restorative cranioplasty following decompressive craniectomy was initially thought to be only for cosmetic and protective purposes. However, recently its role in improving both cortical and subcortical functions as well as increasing cerebral blood flow and restoring cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) dynamics is increasingly being recognised. 34 Thus, surgical repair after DC has positive effects on neurological and cognitive function, which can be objectively assessed. The timing of performing cranioplasty has been a matter of debate with early cranioplasty of 6-8 weeks resulting in higher infection rates as opposed to late cranioplasty of 12-16 weeks resulting in increased chances of hydrocephalus and herniation of the brain. 45

Aim
The aim of this study was to evaluate the ideal timing for performing cranioplasty using autogenous calvarial bone after DC with regards to improvement of neurological function, by comparing complication rates between early and late cranioplasty.

Patients and methods
This record-based study conducted at a tertiary care centre consisted of 31 adult patients, 21 male and 10 female taken up for CP post DC using autologous calvarial bone graft preserved in the anterior abdominal wall of the patient at the time of DC. The procedure had been carried out to evacuate subdural haemorrhage (SDH) as a result of trauma in 21 cases (16 male and 5 female) and stroke in 10 (7 male and 3 female patients). All patients included in the study had only unilateral fronto-tempero parietal defects specifically after DC ( Fig. 1 ).

Exclusion criteria were individuals less than 18 years and older than 70 years and those with oedema/herniation/bulging of the brain on clinical/computed tomographic (CT) examination. Also, patients with sunken flap syndrome and presence of hydrocephalus on preoperative CT were excluded.

The study consisted of two cohorts with Group 1 of 16 patients who were taken up for early cranioplasty (less than or equal to 12 weeks) and Group 2 of 15 patients which had been taken up for delayed cranioplasty (more than 12 weeks). Factors used to allot the patients into either of the two cohorts included patient’s overall clinical status, well–healed surgical site, oedema/herniation of the brain and persistent hydrocephalus/unresolved subdural haematoma/midline shift on computed tomography.

Clinical assessment of the patients was carried out seven days prior to and 30 days after cranioplasty.

All patients were taken up for surgery under general anaesthesia. The cranial defects were exposed in a subgaleal plane ( Fig. 2 ) then stored cranial bone, which had been retrieved from the anterior abdominal wall ( Fig. 3 ), was fixed over the defect using titanium miniplates and screws ( Fig. 4 ) after ensuring satisfactory flushed margins along the defect.

The ‘activities of daily living assessment and functional independence measure’ (FIM) 6 was used for neuromotor and cognitive assessment. The FIM instrument is a basic indicator of severity of disability and comprises of 18 tools or items, each of which is assessed against a seven-point ordinal scale ( Table 1 ). The higher an item scores, the more the patient is able to perform that task independently. Total scores range from 18 to 126. The items are divided into two major groups. Thirteen items test motor function and five test cognitive function. The rating scale designates major graduations in behaviour from dependence, which is scored as 1 to independence for that task, which is scored as 7.

Preoperative and postoperative ratings were carried out by the same observer in our study to rule out any observer bias. A change in the total FIM of greater than 2 points was considered as clinically important. Changes in FIM before and after cranioplasty were compared using a paired t test. Table 2 depicts the FIM score and complications for the two cohorts.

Group 1 = early cranioplasty (</= 12 weeks)
Group 2 = late cranioplasty (>/= 12 weeks)
A comparison of postoperative complication rate was also carried out between the two cohorts. Four tools/items of complications were assessed for: haematoma, infection/surgical site infection, hydrocephalus, and bone flap resorption. Haematoma (epidural or subdural haematoma with clinical signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure with or without midline shift on postoperative CT scan). Infection (surgical-site infection with signs and symptoms of infection (fever, erythema, drainage at the surgical site, or elevated white blood cell count).

All patients with surgical site infection postoperatively underwent reintervention with removal of the cranioplasty flap followed by treatment with intravenous antibiotic therapy as per antibiotic sensitivity and culture results. Hydrocephalus presented with typical symptoms of headache, nausea, or altered sensorium with ventriculomegaly on CT imaging. Persistent hydrocephalus was managed by the neurosurgeon with a CSF/ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Significant resorption of the bone flap after cranioplasty, which manifested clinically as depressed bone margins and loss of bony contour, was confirmed radiologically and removed when posing a concern for patient safety and cosmesis.

Statistical analysis
The quantitative variables were described using mean and standard deviation (SD) whereas the qualitative variables were described using percentages. The baseline variables were analysed for comparability between the groups. The difference in quantitative variables between groups was assessed using the unpaired t test for normally distributed data and by Mann Whitney U test for non-normal data. Individually, each technique was assessed for its effectiveness using the paired t test and between-group differences using the unpaired t test. Qualitative variables were associated using the chi squared test. All the analyses were done using SPSS version 24.0. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
The two groups, namely early cranioplasty and late cranioplasty were compared for baseline characteristics of age and sex. In Group1/early intervention group of cranioplasty (</=12 weeks) comprising of 16 patients, the mean (SD) patient age was 49.50 (10.88) years and in Group 2/late cranioplasty group (>12 week) comprising of 15 patients, the mean (SD) age was 53.13 (11.50) years. The unpaired t test revealed no statistical significance (p = 0.08) between the two groups in terms of age.

Similarly, application of a qualitative chi squared test revealed no statistical significance (p = 0.87) between Group 1 and Group 2 in terms of the gender of the patients. Thus, the two groups were comparable with respect to the outcome variable of FIM.

Describing the neuromotor and cognitive function of patients in Group 1, the mean (SD) FIM value evaluated seven days prior to surgery was 70.06 (18.35) FIM score was analysed 30 days postoperatively and the outcome of improvement was evident in twelve patients (75%). Improvement in these twelve patients was mainly in neuromotor function. Four patients displayed no improvement in FIM scores postoperatively. The mean (SD) FIM value 30 days postoperatively was 77.37 (18.09), thus indicating a mean (SD) difference of 7.31 (5.82) between preoperative and postoperative FIM value. A paired t test comparing FIM value seven days preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively revealed a p value of 0.001 (p = 0.001) which is statistically significant, implying that early cranioplasty (cranioplasty at </=12 weeks) is an effective intervention.

In Group 2/late cranioplasty group (>12 week) comprising of 15 patients, the mean (SD) FIM score of 15 patients evaluated seven days preoperatively was 68.40 (20.24). Thirty days postoperatively, eight patients (53.3%) displayed improvement in neuromotor function and the mean FIM score of 15 patients postoperatively was 73.07 (23.33). The mean (SD) difference in pre- and post-FIM score was 4.66 (5.62). The paired t test comparing FIM value seven days preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively for Group 2 revealed a p value of 0.006 (p = 0.006), which is statistically significant, implying that the intervention yielded successful results in late cranioplasty too.

Inter-group comparison between Group 1 and Group 2 for superior efficacy in terms of improvement in FIM score was conducted using the Mann Whitney U test ( Table 3 ). Although displaying a difference of 2.64 units. Group 1 showed higher pre/post differences with a mean (SD) of 7.31 (5.82) units as compared with Group 2 with 4.67 (5.62) units. While this is clinically significant, statistical significance could not be achieved with p = 0.20, implying statistically no significant difference between performing cranioplasty early (</= 12 weeks) or late (>12 weeks). This difference in the FIM values seven days before and 30 days after cranioplasty between Group 1 and Group 2 is as depicted in a Box and Whisker plot ( Fig. 5 ).

With regards to complication rates, Group 1 had three complications (18.75 %), consisting of two surgical site infections for which the bone graft had to be subsequently removed two weeks after CP, and one complication of hydrocephalus. Group 2, had four complications (26.66%), consisting of one extradural haematoma which formed postoperatively, one hydrocephalus and two cases of bone graft resorption. The patient with the extradural haematoma exhibited deterioration in his FIM score that was evaluated 30 days postoperatively. There was no statistical significance in the complication rates between Group 1 and Group 2.

All patients developing hydrocephalus were managed with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement.

Discussion
Several theories have been proposed to improve neuromotor and cognitive function after cranioplasty following DC, including the direct effect of atmospheric air on the brain, 7 alterations in CSF dynamics, 8 changes in cerebral blood flow 9 and altered cerebral metabolism. 10

The literature does not have clearly established definitions of early and late cranioplasty. Most studies have broadly included a time interval of 90–120 days as early cranioplasty. 1112 Some case reports have even shown that performing ultra-early cranioplasty (8-12 weeks), specifically after trauma, has low complication rates. 13

Factors that are usually used to determine an appropriate timing for cranioplasty after DC include the overall clinical and neurological status of the patient, absence of any cerebral oedema, and the postoperative status of the surgical site.

The ideal timing for performing CP after DC remains a dilemma. It has been thought that performing an early cranioplasty (in less than three months after DC) was associated with a poor outcome. 14 Concerns about reopening a possibly contaminated surgical site and possible risk of dural tears during re-intervention forced some operators to delay cranioplasty.

The primary advantage of early restoration of a skull defect is avoiding post-decompression hydrocephalus, and/or developing ‘Syndrome of the Trephined’. 1516 Theories exist that if large skull defects expose the underlying brain to elevated atmospheric pressure for long durations, it can have consequences of brain haemodynamic impairment. 3 Magnaes et al have shown that alteration in the CSF pressure level and the intracranial hydrostatic pressure occurs after cranioplasty in patients with large skull defects, thereby improving neurological function. 17

This study suggests that after decompressive craniectomy, performing an early cranioplasty before or at 12 weeks improves neuromotor function and reduces disabilities. The complication rates are on par with delayed cranioplasty beyond 12 weeks. This enables a faster return of function and form of the patient without increasing risk of complications.

Establishing statistical significance in difference between mean FIM improvement score between early and late cranioplasty groups could not be achieved while demonstrating clinical significance between the two groups, due to the limitation of the small sample sizes of the two cohorts and also the risk of bias inherent to retrospectively-designed cohort investigations.

Conclusion
Early cranioplasty, where feasible, offers significant advantages in improving patient neuromotor and cognitive function, reducing disability, and enhancing overall quality of life, while reducing factors like hospital and attendant dependence. It also avoids other complications like ‘Syndrome of the Trephined’ from setting in. Complication rates between early and late cranioplasty do not appear to have a clinically significant role in deciding timing of intervention as long as careful case selection is carried out.

","This study evaluates the optimal timing for performing cranioplasty (CP) following decompressive craniectomy (DC) by comparing early versus delayed interventions. DC is a life-saving procedure performed to reduce intracranial pressure in patients suffering from severe head injuries or strokes, while CP is intended to repair the skull defect created by DC. Traditionally viewed as a cosmetic or protective measure, recent insights suggest that CP may also enhance cortical and subcortical functions, improve cerebral blood flow, and normalize cerebrospinal fluid dynamics.

In this retrospective record-based study conducted at a tertiary care center, 31 adult patients (21 males and 10 females) undergoing CP with autogenous calvarial bone (stored in the anterior abdominal wall during DC) were analyzed. The patients, all with unilateral fronto-temporo-parietal defects, were divided into two cohorts: Group 1 underwent early CP (≤12 weeks post-DC; n = 16) and Group 2 underwent delayed CP (>12 weeks post-DC; n = 15). Neuromotor and cognitive functions were assessed using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale, with evaluations performed seven days before and 30 days after CP.

Group 1 demonstrated a mean FIM improvement of 7.31 points, with 75% of patients showing notable gains, while Group 2 exhibited a mean improvement of 4.66 points, with 53.3% demonstrating improvement. Although both groups achieved statistically significant within-group improvements, the inter-group difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.20). Complication rates were similar between groups.

The study concludes that, with careful case selection, early CP (<12 weeks) offers advantages in enhancing neuromotor and cognitive recovery without incurring additional risks, potentially accelerating patients’ return to normal function.","This study investigates the optimal timing for cranioplasty (CP) with autogenous bone after decompressive craniectomy (DC) in adult patients. It compares early (≤12 weeks) versus late (>12 weeks) CP regarding neurological function improvement, measured using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and complication rates. A retrospective analysis of 31 patients undergoing CP post-DC for subdural hemorrhage or stroke was conducted. Patients with pre-existing hydrocephalus or brain bulging were excluded.

The results showed significant FIM score improvement post-CP in both early and late groups. While the early group showed a slightly greater improvement, the difference wasn't statistically significant. The complication rates (infection, hydrocephalus, bone resorption) were comparable between the two groups.

The study concludes that early cranioplasty is an effective intervention that improves neuromotor function, while not significantly increasing complications. It suggests that performing CP at or before 12 weeks after DC can lead to a faster return of function and form without a greater risk of complications. The authors acknowledge the limitation of small sample size and retrospective design.","This study investigates the optimal timing for cranioplasty (CP) following decompressive craniectomy (DC) in patients with severe head injuries or strokes. CP, which restores cranial defects, is increasingly recognized for improving neurological and cognitive functions, beyond its cosmetic and protective roles. The study compares early (≤12 weeks) and late (>12 weeks) CP to assess their impact on functional outcomes and complication rates.

A retrospective analysis of 31 patients (21 male, 10 female) who underwent CP using autologous calvarial bone grafts was conducted. Patients were divided into Group 1 (early CP, n=16) and Group 2 (late CP, n=15). Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale, which assesses neuromotor and cognitive functions. Complications such as infection, hydrocephalus, and bone graft resorption were also recorded.

Results showed that early CP significantly improved FIM scores (mean difference: 7.31, p=0.001), with 75% of patients showing improvement. Late CP also improved FIM scores (mean difference: 4.66, p=0.006), but to a lesser extent. Complication rates were comparable between groups (18.75% in Group 1 vs. 26.66% in Group 2), with no significant difference. Early CP was associated with faster functional recovery without increasing complication risks.

However, the low retention and survival rate of engrafted BMSCs limit their therapeutic efficacy. Strategies either modifying BMSCs or alleviating the inflammatory environment may solve this problem. Thus, we aimed to explore the therapeutic efficacy of sequential transplantation of exosomes and hypoxia pretreated BMSCs on flap necrosis. After the perforator flap model was created, the exosomes derived from BMSCs were injected immediately into choke zone II followed by transplantation of hypoxia pretreated BMSCs on Day 2. Gross view was performed to assess the flap survival, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to evaluate the inflammatory factor level, microvessel number was assessed and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to assess angiogenesis. We found that exosome delivery significantly reduced inflammatory cytokines levels on Day 1 and Day 3 and promoted the engrafted BMSCs? survival on Day 7. After combining with transplantation of hypoxia pretreated BMSCs, the flap survival rate and the angiogenesis-related gene expression were significantly higher than in the other three groups; the von Willebrand factor (vWF) vascular diameter and vWF vascular count were significantly higher than in the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) group. Thus, we concluded that sequential transplantation of exosomes and BMSCs combinatorially pretreated with hypoxia further facilitated flap survival. This sequential transplantation approach provides novel insights into the clinical treatment of flap necrosis.","Introduction
Perforator flap transplantation is a crucial technique for the clinical repair of extensive tissue defects following the principle of ‘minimal morbidity at the donor site, greatest aesthetics at the recipient site.’ 1 However, the challenge of necrosis of the distal part of the flap continues to limit its clinical application, particularly in the multi-territory perforator flap. According to Cormac and Lamberty’s study, 2 angiosomes served as the fundamental anatomical unit of perforator flaps, and an extended perforator flap could be categorised into three units, the anatomical territory, the dynamic territory, and the potential territory. The choke vascular anastomosis connects the two adjacent territories. When the blood supply of a three-territory perforator flap is only dependent on one vessel, necrosis often occurs in the distal part of the flap due to delayed reconstruction of vascular anastomosis in choke zone II. 3 Therefore, how to address the angiogenesis or vasculogenesis is the key to boost the survival rate of the flap.

Stem cell based therapy is regarded as a promising strategy for regenerating ischaemic tissue, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are considered the optimal candidates due to their exceptional tissue regeneration and immunomodulatory properties. 45 In our previous study, we found that local transplantation of a high dosage of BMSCs could increase microvessel diameter and density through the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD31 expression, increasing the survival area of the perforator flap. However, the low retention and poor survival of the transplanted BMSCs in the flaps limit their therapeutic efficacy. 67 The issue might be resolved by techniques that either modify BMSCs or reduce the inflammatory environment that encourages the recruitment and survival of BMSCs. 8910 Exosomes are extracellular vesicles, which contain a variety of bioactive proteins and RNAs, and play important roles in many cellular processes. 1112 Their use has been widely reported to demonstrate significant advantages in mitigating inflammation, enhancing cell viability, promoting migration activities. 131415 Furthermore, numerous strategies, such as drug pretreatment, hypoxia preconditioning, and genetic modifications have been developed to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of BMSCs. 16171819 Among these methods, hypoxic preconditioning is widely utilised and has the potential to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of BMSCs in angiogenesis or vasculogenesis. 2021 Whether a combined strategy of exosomes and hypoxic pretreatment could better enhance the therapeutic efficacy of BMSCs has not been explored yet, to our knowledge.

In the present study, we first explored the anti-inflammatory effects of delivery exosomes, and further investigated the effects of sequential delivery of exosomes and hypoxic preconditioning BMSCs in perforator flaps.

Methods
Animals
All protocols for animal experiments and animal care were approved by the Animal Care and Experiment Ethics Committee of Peking Union Medical College. We used twelve male Wistar rats (2–4 weeks old) as sources of exosomes and stem cells, while 42 male Wistar rats (4–6 weeks old) were employed as animal flap models.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells’ isolation and culture
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and amplified according to our previous study. 1 BMSCs were obtained from the femur and tibia of the rats and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) and included 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Gibco). Passage 3 generation BMSCs and passage 4 generation BMSCs were used for experiments. For hypoxia pretreatment (BMSC h ), when passage 3-4 BMSCs grew to approximately 60%, BMSCs were cultured in a humidified incubator (BioSpherix, Ltd) with 1% O 2 at 37 °C for 24 h.

Exosomes isolation, identification, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell labelling
Exosomes from culture supernatants were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation according to the Cheng et al study. 13 Collected cell culture supernatant was subjected to several centrifugations (300, 2000, and 10,000 g for 15, 15, and 40 min, respectively). After each centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered through 0.22 μm filters and the resultant was collected. Then the resultant was subjected to centrifugation at 110,000g for 75 min to yield a pellet that was suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then centrifuged again at 110,000 g for 75 min. The exosomes were stored at −80 °C for future use. The total protein concentration of exosomes was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology). The morphology and size of exosomes were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Hitachi-HT7800) and Nano Sight analysis (NTA), (ZetaView® PMX 10, Particle Metrix), respectively. Exosome markers were analysed via Western blotting.

For assessing the cell survival, when passage 3 BSMCs reached 80% confluency, BMSCs were rinsed with sterile PBS two times, then followed by culturing in medium containing 2 mg/L Cell Tracker™ CM-Dil Dye (CM-Dil) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) for 10 min at 37 °C and 15 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were collected and injected in the choke zone II.

Three-territory flap model establishment, exosome injection, and BMSC transplantation flap surgery
Three-territory flap model was established according to Ding et al’s study. 1 Rats were randomised into the following groups (n = 3): PBS group, Exo group (exosome treatment alone), Exo + BMSC group, Exo + BMSC h group. Thirty minutes after the completion of trans-zone perforator flap surgery, exosomes (20 ug, in 100 uL PBS) were evenly injected into the choke zone II at 10 points, and the control group was injected with the same volume of PBS. At 48h after the flap operation, 2 × 10 6 CM-Dil fluorescently labelled BMSCs, BMSCs, or hypoxic preconditioned BMSCs were injected into choke zone II, respectively.

Assessment of flap survival rate
On Day 7, the flap survival was estimated by measuring the sizes of the viable area using digital image analysis. The standards of flap necrosis were classed as: the flap turning darker in colour, tissue retraction, hardening of the texture, or the formation of necrotic wounds. The results were expressed as percentages of the survival area relative to the total area of the flap by image analysis with Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics). 1

Histological examination
On Day 7, tissue samples obtained from the central region of choke zone II were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and subsequently sectioned into slices with a thickness of 5 mm. Then sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). An additional set of cross-sections stained with the von Willebrand factor (vWF) for immunohistochemical examination. Images (n = 6) were calculated with image-editing software (Image-Pro Plus 6.0, Media Cybernetics) to count the vWF-positive microvessels and vWF-positive vascular diameter.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) of angiogenic-related genes.

Samples harvested from the middle of choke zone II were cut into pieces and minced with a homogeniser, and the total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation). The RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using the manufacturer's protocol (using TRIzol reagent) to generate single-stranded complementary DNA. The expression levels of selected genes were quantified using a SYBR Green kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and analysed by q-PCR on a Lightcycler 480 system (ABI StepOne plus). To standardise mRNA concentrations, ß-actin was utilised as an internal reference gene. The primer sequences for the forward and reverse pairs are provided in ( [CR] , online only).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Tissues of the flap were homogenised and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15 min. The supernatant of protein was determined using a Bicinchoninic Acid kit (BCA kit) (Beyotime Biotechnology). Rat TNF-α, rat IL-6, rat IL-1β ELISA kits (R&D Systems Inc) were used to quantify the expression level of inflammatory cytokines. The results were assessed using a microplate reader at 450 nm.

Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as the mean ± standard error. The differences of normal variates were tested by Student’s t test within two groups. A p value of 0.05 or under was accepted as statistically significant. SPSS 23 software was used for all statistical analyses.

Results
Identification of exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
TEM and NTA were used to identify the shape and size of BMSCs-derived exosomes, which were typically cup-shaped with a mean (SD) size of 121.4 (50–200) nm ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 A). Western blot analysis indicated that the isolated exosomes expressed exosome-specific proteins: TSG101, CD9, CD63, and CD81 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 B).

Exosome and the combinatorially hypoxia pretreated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell delivery improved the flap survival
On Day 7, surviving flap portions grew fine hair but the necrotic regions became hard, dark, and glabrous ( Figs. 2–5 ). The mean flap survival rate was increased in an order of the PBS group, Exo group, Exo + BMSC group and Exo + BMSC h group ( Fig. 6 ). The Exo + BMSC group had a significantly higher flap survival rate than the Exo group (p < 0.05) and PBS group (p < 0.001). The flap survival rate of the Exo + BMSC h group was significantly higher than that of the Exo + BMSC group (p < 0.05). The results indicated that to get better flap survival, exosome delivery combined with hypoxia pretreated BMSCs transplantation exerted better therapeutic efficacy.

Exosome delivery reduced inflammation
Exosome delivery significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine levels compared with the PBS group, as indicated by the ELISA results for IL-6 (p < 0.001), IL-1ß (p < 0.05) on the Day 1 and IL-6 (p < 0.05), TNF-α (p < 0.05) on Day 3 after operation ( Supplementary Fig. 2 , online only). CM-Dil fluorescent labelling results showed that there was a significant difference between PBS + BMSC and Exo + BMSC group (p < 0.05) on Day 7 ( Supplementary Fig. 3 , online only).

Neovascularisation assessment by histological evaluation
Both the HE and vWF immunohistochemical staining showed more blood vessels in the Exo + BMSC h group than in the PBS group and Exo group. The mean (SD) number of vWF positive microvessels was significantly increased in the Exo + BMSC h group than in the PBS group (31.67 (3.05) in the Exo + BMSC h group and 16 (3.6) in the PBS group, p < 0.05). On the other hand, the mean (SD) vessel diameter was significantly larger in the Exo + BMSC h group than in the PBS group: 68.1 (7.56) um and 49.45 (6.29) um, respectively; p < 0.001). ( Supplementary Fig. 4 , online only).

Differential expressions of angiogenic-related and nitric oxide genes in choke zone II
The results showed that the mRNA expression of VEGF, CD31, α-SMA were significantly upregulated in Exo + BMSC h group compared with the other three groups, whereas similar expression levels were found in the Exo and Exo + BMSC groups. In addition, nitric oxide synthases, including HIF-1α, iNOS, eNOS showed the highest expression levels in the Exo + BMSC h group than in the other three groups ( Supplementary Fig. 5 , online only).

Discussion
Although various types of stem cell transplantation appear to be promising strategies for enhancing flap survival, the limited viability of engrafted cells has constrained their therapeutic efficacy, 22 Exosome transplantation has been demonstrated to ameliorate inflammation and improve cell survival. 23 Therefore, we explored whether exosome delivery could ameliorate the harsh microenvironment to facilitate stem cells, survival, and whether combined pretreatment with hypoxia could better enhance the vascularisation effects of the transplanted BMSCs. The main findings were as follows:

(1) sequential delivery of BMSCs after exosome injection significantly facilitated flap survival;
(2) exosome delivery significantly limited inflammatory factor expression and increased cell survival;
(3) combined pretreatment with hypoxia increased angiogenesis of transplanted BMSCs.
As a promising cell-free treatment strategy for promoting flap survival, growing evidence indicated that exosomes derived from BMSCs played important roles in helping to prevent inflammation, 2425 enhance cellular activity and angiogenesis, all of which are crucial to improve flap survival. 2326 However, the short half-life limited the therapeutic application of exosomes. In this study, we demonstrated that early injection of exosomes effectively ameliorated inflammatory factors, expression on Day 1 and Day 3. However, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1ß still increased from Day 3 to Day 7. This phenomenon not only indicated exosomes had a short half-life, but also stated Day 2 postoperatively was an appropriate time for sequential transplantation of BMSCs. In our study, we observed sequential transplantation of BMSCs on Day 2 after exosome injection really augmented BMSCs survival. These results lead us to conclude that exosome injection could inhibit the inflammatory response and enhance BMSC survival.

It is well known that angiogenesis plays a key role in flap survival. In our previous study, we demonstrated the positive effects of BMSCs on vascular regeneration in a three-territory perforator flap model. 1 Due to the limited retention and survival rate of BMSCs, numerous methods including drug pretreatment, hypoxia preconditioning, and genetic modification have been developed to modify the therapeutic efficacy of BMSCs. 16171819 In the field of regenerative medicine, BMSCs are studied in vitro under hypoxic tension (1% O 2 ) prior to transplantation into an in vivo setting. 27 Wu et al found that the proangiogenic potential of ASCs was enhanced by hypoxic preconditioning. 20 Zhang et al demonstrated that hypoxic preconditioning could improve BMSCs viability in the bone defect and keep the number of BMSCs at a high level, thus improving the bone healing ability of BMSCs. 21 Dr Andalib reported that hypoxia-mesenchymal stem cells in treatment of anaerobic bacterial wound infection led to wound healing and infection recovery. 28 Therefore, we chose hypoxic pretreatment to test whether the vascularisation effects of BMSCs could be enhanced. We found that BMSCs pretreated with hypoxia significantly upregulated the vascularisation factor expression and achieved the highest flap survival rate. For three-territory flap surgery, early injection of exosomes could ameliorate the harsh microenvironment and prolong the therapeutic window for BMSC transplantation. Although further specific mechanisms and large animal experiments are needed, this sequential transplantation approach provides novel insights into the clinical treatment of flap necrosis.

In conclusion, sequential transplantation of exosomes and combinatorial pretreatment of BMSCs with hypoxia further facilitated flap survival. Considering the promising potential, continuous exploration to develop novel cell-based approaches, such as combining different stem cells or exosomes with biomaterials, might help to achieve better results.

The research focuses on enhancing flap survival by combining two innovative strategies: exosome delivery and hypoxic preconditioning of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs).

Perforator flaps, based on angiosome anatomy, often suffer from necrosis in the distal regions due to delayed vascular anastomosis in the choke zones. Previous findings indicated that BMSCs can improve vascular regeneration by upregulating factors such as VEGF and CD31, but their clinical efficacy is limited by poor cell retention and survival. To overcome these issues, the researchers first isolated and characterized exosomes from BMSCs, which are known to reduce inflammation and promote cellular viability.

Using a three-territory perforator flap model in rats, the study compared four groups: a PBS control, an exosome-only group, a group receiving exosomes plus standard BMSCs, and a group receiving exosomes plus hypoxia-preconditioned BMSCs. Exosomes were injected into the critical choke zone shortly after surgery, followed by BMSC transplantation 48 hours later. Assessments included flap survival measurements, histological and immunohistochemical analyses, and evaluations of inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic gene expression.

The results demonstrated that sequential delivery significantly improved flap survival, with the best outcomes observed in the group receiving hypoxia-preconditioned BMSCs. This combined approach enhanced neovascularisation, increased vascular marker expression, and reduced inflammation, suggesting a promising strategy to mitigate flap necrosis in clinical settings.","This research paper investigates strategies to improve the survival rate of perforator flaps, a technique used to repair extensive tissue defects.

Exosomes, derived from BMSCs, were isolated and characterized, showing typical cup-shaped structures and expressing specific markers.

Bilateral mandibular angle fractures (BMAF) represent a rare and complex subset of traumatic maxillofacial injuries. Accounting for approximately 2% of mandibular fractures, BMAF predominantly affect males in their third decade of life and linked to impacted lower third molars, which reduce fracture resistance.[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] Common injury mechanisms include motor vehicle accidents (MVA), interpersonal violence, sports injuries, and falls. 5
The intricate nature of BMAF management stems from the complex biomechanics exerted on the three detached fragments of the mandible (figure 1). 8 Superior force vectors applied to the angles of the mandible coupled with an inferior vector applied to the intermediate corpus frequently leads to the development of an anterior open bite and malocclusion.[8], [9] Other presentations include trismus, altered facial aesthetics and temporomandibular joint pain. BMAF demand precise, timely intervention to mitigate potential complications, which may include infection, malocclusion, and hardware failure.[1], [2], [4], [8], [10]

Effective imaging modalities play a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of BMAF. Computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for maxillofacial injuries. Panoramic radiographs offer high sensitivity in detecting mandibular fractures, facilitating prompt diagnosis and management.[11], [12] While imaging protocols for common mandibular fractures have been detailed heavily in literature, there has been limited emphasis of imaging in BMAF.
Similarly, literature on the surgical management of BMAF is sparse. Various approaches have been suggested; with contrasting surgical approaches, fixation methods, and management of impacted third molars. Conflicting methods highlight the need for standardisation to optimise patient outcomes.
Internal reduction of a fracture can be categorised as either rigid or non-rigid. Rigid fixation involves the stabilisation of a fracture site that is achieved through either a combination of two plates that span a fracture, or a single, larger plate (typically with two screws either side of the fracture). Contrarily, non-rigid fixation allows more interfragmentary mobility and typically involves using a single, thinner plate (generally less than 2.0mm).[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]
Boffano et al favoured BMAF management with bilateral non-rigid miniplates placed either at the external oblique ridge, or superior lateral border, through intraoral or transoral/transbuccal approaches.10 This technique was popularised by Champy, and utilises a tension-band principle, where plating along the superior border of the mandible counteracts tensile forces and promotes a stable fixation.[13], [14] A 2014, prospective study by Cillo et al showed successful outcomes with rigid/non-rigid fixation.2 Rigid fixation was achieved on the most displaced fracture through either an intraoral or transbuccal approach with two miniplates. On the least displaced fracture, an intraoral approach was taken and a single, superior border miniplate was used. Segura-Pallerès et al similarly favoured management with at least one point of rigid fixation and preferenced removal of all impacted third molars in the surgical site. 4
A recent paper by Young et al suggested that management with bilateral non-rigid achieved similar outcomes when compared to cases with at-least one side of rigid fixation. 3 This study also showed a significant increase in utilising non-rigid/non-rigid fixation in the later years of the study, citing ease of operation and reduction in operation time. Raidoo et al’s 2022 study similarly compared different fixation methods on 56 cases, also suggesting that no fixation status resulted in changes in complication risk. 1 However, there was discrepancies between the definition/ requirements for ‘rigid’ fixation between these studies, with Raidoo et al. considering a single 1.25mm plate to be rigid.1
The extraction of impacted lower third molars in the management of BMAF remains a topic of contention, with varying approaches observed in literature. Philosophies of management span from the removal of all third molars within fracture sites, to approaches wherein extraction is only limited to third molars with pathology, mobility, or interfering with fracture reduction.[1], [2], [4] Retaining the third molar within the fracture site in unilateral mandibular fractures has been shown to reduce postoperative complications and incidence of inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) damage compared to when the third molar is extracted.5
No systematic review has yet addressed the management of BMAF. This study endeavours to fill this void by conducting an exhaustive review of the current literature, thereby presenting best practices for the management of BMAF. Specifically, the review aims to develop understanding of various facets of BMAF, including patient factors, procedural factors, and post-operative outcomes. By consolidating existing evidence, the ultimate objective is to establish a consensus on BMAF management, thereby enhancing patient outcomes in this complex clinical scenario.

Quality Assessment
The overall quality of evidence was moderate (Appendix: Table 1). All cases were retrospective, however, Cillo et al2 had a prospective division of their study. Unbiased assessment, calculation of population size, control group and baseline equivalence were variably reported in the studies.
Patient Factors
There were 198 cases of BMAF in the four included studies. The mean age was 25 years (range 14-83 years), with 94.9% male (n=188) (Table 1).

Interpersonal violence was the leading mechanism of injury (76.8%, n=152), followed by sports-related injuries (10.1%, n=20), MVA (7.7%, n=14) and falls (6.1%, n=12).
BMAF classification was inconsistently reported. Young et al classified patients by the highest grade of displacement from either fracture site.3 Cases were described as minimal (n=21), moderate (n=32), or severe displacement (n=26) based on pre-operative radiographs. Segura-Pallerès et al4 classified each case based on the status of combined fractures. Displaced/ undisplaced was the most reported fracture pattern (n=11). Other studies did not classify displacement.
Data on associated facial injuries was reported in one study, occurring in 10.7% (n=6) of cases. However, no specific injuries were described1. No studies reported data on other associated injuries.
Two studies collected their data from Australian populations, while Segura-Pallerès et al and Cillo et al performed their studies in Europe and the United States of America, respectively.[1], [2], [3], [4]
Procedural Factors
Two papers described procedural timing. One study described a median operation time of 3 days, with a range of 0-28 days.3 Another reported that all 33 cases were performed within a week of presentation.2
Three studies reported data on the surgical approach (Table 2).[2], [3], [4] A transbuccal approach was the most common, used in 53.2% (n=151) of fractures, followed by intraoral (29.9%, n=85) and then a combined intraoral-and-transbuccal approach (16.9%, n=48).

Fixation approach was reported in four papers. A non-rigid/rigid approach was the most common reported approach to fixation, used in 55.4% (n=113) of patients, followed by a non-rigid/non-rigid (33.3%, n=66), and then rigid/rigid (9.6%, n=16) (Table 2).
Three studies descriptively reported on the presence of impacted third molars and their management (Table 2). In these studies, impacted third molars were present 91.6% of the time (n=251). Of these, 92 were extracted during management of the BMAF. Cillo et al2 reported that 27 patients had at least one impacted lower third molar and that all of these were removed during management of BMAF.
No data was reported on the use of guided versus non-guided management of BMAF.
Two studies reported data on post-operative inter-maxillary fixation (IMF), reporting use in 9.2% (n=10) of cases.
Post-operative Outcomes
A total of 36 complications were reported (Table 3). Complications included: infection (n=11), malocclusion (n=9), dehiscence/ exposed plate (n=7), loose screw/plate (7), plate exposure (2), pain at plate site (1).

Three studies categorised the complications based on if the complication was associated with rigid or non-rigid fixated plates (Table 4).[1], [2], [3] There were 21 complications with plates with non-rigid fixations, out of a total of 222 non-rigid plates (9.5%). The complication rate for rigid plates was 12 complications, with a total of 124 plates used (9.7%).

Discussion
Following a thorough analysis of eligible papers, a review on patient factors, procedural factors and post-operative outcomes was performed. The analysis highlights a critical gap in current literature on BMAF. This scarcity significantly limits the ability to draw comprehensive conclusions and suggests that our current understanding of BMAF management is based on a narrow scope of evidence.
Patient demographics, mechanisms of injury and associated injuries were reported in in Table 1. The mean age of patients was 25 years, with 94.9% of all cases being male. This is in line with general trends of maxillofacial injuries. However, BMAF shows a higher predilection for males-affected compared to general maxillofacial injuries, where 80% of those affected are males.[16], [17], [18], [19] The leading cause of BMAF was interpersonal violence, accounting for 76.8% of cases. Comparatively, interpersonal violence is responsible for approximately 60% of general maxillofacial injuries.[18], [19] The stronger predilection for males compared to general trends of maxillofacial injuries may be explained by the higher rates of interpersonal violence as a cause for BMAF.20 There was similar mechanism of injuries reported between studies regardless of them being performed in different locations. However, both studies performed in Australia showed a higher prevalence of sports-related injury.
Only one study reported associated facial injuries (10.7%), with no data on other injuries.1 Given that concurrent facial, cervical spine, and neurological injuries frequently accompany mandible fractures, this emphasises a gap in reporting of BMAF and underscores the broader limitations imposed by the scarcity of studies. [16], [21] Future studies should aim to address this by providing comprehensive data on concurrent injuries and their impact on BMAF management.
Data on procedural timing, surgical approach, and fixation methods were reported in Table 2 and varied among the included studies. Surgical timing reporting was inconsistent, however, all studies highlighted the importance of early primary management. One study reported a median operation time of 3 days, another stated that all operations were performed within a week of presentation.[2], [3] No studies discussed precise imaging protocols, including timing of radiographs or use of panoramic vs CT imaging.
The surgical approach was delineated based on the incisions at each fracture site, as different surgical approaches were often employed for each fracture. The transbuccal approach was the most common, utilised in just over half (53.2%) of surgical sites, followed by intraoral and then combined intraoral-and-transbuccal approach. There was discrepancy between two authors on the best approach for when a superior lateral border plate (Champy technique) was used. One paper demonstrated preference for a transbuccal approach, citing lower complication rates compared to when an intraoral approach is used.3 However, one paper preferred using an intraoral approach for the Champy technique, citing reduction in facial nerve injury, easier technique, quicker patient recovery and avoidance of facial scars.2 Selection of the approach varied based on the fixation method applied, surgeon preference and patient-specific factors.
Similarly, there was significant variation in the fixation methods between studies. Non-rigid/rigid fixation was the common fixation, employed in over half (55.4%) of cases. In cases where non-rigid/rigid fixation was used, there was a preference rigid fixation at the more displaced fracture. Fracture displacement was nonuniformly categorised and reported in the studies, posing a limitation to this review.
Definitions of rigid fixation varied among studies. This was seen by differences between Young et al3 and Raidoo et al1 in the width required to be considered rigid fixation. This lack of standardisation posed a limitation, as rigidity was reported based on the individual surgical methods of each study.[1], [3]
Postoperative IMF was uncommonly used; employed in under one-in-ten (9.2%) cases. Segura-Pallerès et al4 used post-operative IMF for 2 weeks exclusively for cases of non-rigid/non-rigid fixations, claiming bilateral non-rigid fixation was insufficient for maintaining interfragmentary reduction. However, Young et al3 employed 52 cases of non-rigid/non-rigid fixation, and only implemented post-operative IMF in three of these cases. With comparable outcomes observed with contrasting IMF usage, this suggests that IMF may not be universally required in non-rigid/non-rigid fixation. Decisions should be tailored to patient-specific factors and fracture complexity.
Impacted lower third molars were present in 91.6% of fracture sites. However, it is important to note that one study excluded all cases without impacted lower molars.4 The association between BMAF and impacted third molars supports previous studies that demonstrate that impacted third molars increase the susceptibility of the mandible to angle fractures.[5], [6], [7] Impacted third molars were extracted in over one-third (36.7%) of the cases where they were present in the fracture site. While Cillo et al’s findings couldn’t be quantified for this analysis, they reported that 27 patients had at least one impacted lower third molar and all of these were removed during management of BMAF. A 2023 review on removal of third molars in mandible angle repair demonstrated that retaining asymptomatic molars in fracture sites may result in lower overall complications and less IAN damage.5 Indications for extracting the third molar have been suggested, including cases where there was a pathology associated with the tooth or if the molar interfered with fracture reduction, however, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate these indications. The studies contributed insufficient uniform clinical data regarding whether extraction of impacted third molars alters BMAF outcome prognosis and hence no unified consensus on this exists yet. Thus extraction risks or considerations must weigh alongside surgical expertise, individual anatomical features and clinical judgement.
Complications following BMAF management were reported in Table 3. The overall incidence of postoperative complications was 18.2%. Infection was the most common complication (n=11), followed by malocclusion and hardware failure. Revision surgeries were performed in approximately 1 in 10 surgeries, primarily due to infection and hardware failure. Surprisingly, this is lower than the reported revision surgery rate for isolated mandible fractures in some studies.22 One proposed explanation for this disparity is the varying surgical experience among surgeons managing isolated mandibular fractures as opposed to BMAF.
In three studies, complication rates were able to be discussed at a fracture-level and compared between the method of fixation. Complication rates between fractures managed with rigid and non-rigid plates was similar (9.7%, 9.5% respectively). Similarly, no individual study reported changes in complications based on the overall fixation status. Previous retrospective studies on other types of bilateral mandible fractures suggested that non-rigid/non-rigid fixation was associated with significantly higher major complications when compared to rigid/non-rigid fixation of bilateral mandible fractures.23 However, recent RCTs have demonstrated successful outcomes with both non-rigid/non-rigid and rigid/non-rigid fixation.24 These results emphasise patient-specific factors and surgical experience in fixation decisions. Young et al. demonstrated an increasing preference for use of non-rigid/non-rigid fixation in the later stages of its study; noting surgical ease and reduction in surgical cost and operation time as advantages to this technique.3 Other papers demonstrate preference for rigid/rigid fixation in cases of severe displacement fractures and difficult reductions.4 Overall, whilst there is insufficient evidence that specific fixation methods are associated with higher rates of complications, these findings suggest that clinicians should rely on a case-by-case assessment, incorporating patient-specific factors, fracture complexity, and their own surgical expertise to guide fixation decisions.
At a review level, the limited number of studies available for inclusion underscores the imperative for future research endeavours with robust methodologies, standardised protocols, comprehensive reporting, and consistent outcome measures. Exclusion of non-English publication is a further limitation of the study, through restricting the breadth of studies eligible for inclusion in the review. At a study level, addressing the challenges posed by inconsistent reporting highlights the importance of adopting standardised approaches for reporting. Specifically, future studies should apply more consistent classification of fixation status, imaging protocols, identifying associated injuries, and categorising fracture displacement.
In conclusion, this systematic review provides valuable insights into the clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes, and complications associated with BMAF. By adhering to rigorous methodology and transparent reporting, this review informs of current clinical practice in BMAF management, contributes to the existing literature on BMAF, and guides future research endeavours. Further well-conducted research is essential to building upon the understanding of this rare and complex maxillofacial injury. Addressing this gap in literature is crucial for expanding knowledge, improving evidence-based decisions and advancing patient outcomes.

Predominantly affecting young males in their third decade, BMAF are frequently associated with impacted lower third molars, which compromise the mandible’s structural integrity. Commonly resulting from interpersonal violence, motor vehicle accidents, sports injuries, or falls, these fractures are complicated by the biomechanics of three detached mandibular fragments. The opposing force vectors often result in anterior open bite, malocclusion, trismus, and temporomandibular joint pain, making prompt and precise management critical.

Following PRISMA guidelines, the review searched PubMed and Scopus for English-language studies from January 1993 to November 2023. Out of 181 identified records, four studies met the inclusion criteria, providing data on 198 BMAF cases. Demographic analysis revealed that 94.9% of patients were male, with interpersonal violence emerging as the leading cause. The review details diverse procedural factors, noting that imaging (with CT as the gold standard), surgical approaches (with transbuccal incisions used in over half the cases), and fixation techniques (ranging from rigid to non-rigid methods) varied widely across studies. Impacted third molar management was inconsistent, with extractions performed in roughly one-third of cases.

Overall postoperative complications occurred in approximately 18% of cases, with infection, malocclusion, and hardware failure being the most common. The review highlights significant gaps and heterogeneity in the current literature, underscoring the need for standardized protocols and more robust, well-designed studies to optimize clinical outcomes in BMAF management.","This systematic review examines the current literature on Bilateral Mandibular Angle Fractures (BMAF), a rare injury predominantly affecting young males, often linked to impacted third molars and trauma like violence or MVAs. The study, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, analyzed four studies (198 BMAF cases) identified from PubMed and Scopus, focusing on patient and procedural factors, and post-operative outcomes.

The findings revealed that interpersonal violence was the leading cause. Surgical management varied, with transbuccal approaches and non-rigid/rigid fixation being common. Impacted third molars were frequent, with their extraction remaining controversial. Complication rates were similar between rigid and non-rigid fixation methods.

The review highlights a significant gap in BMAF literature, hindering definitive conclusions. There's a need for standardized reporting of fixation status, imaging, associated injuries, and fracture displacement. Future research should prioritize robust methodologies, standardized protocols, and comprehensive data to improve understanding and patient outcomes in BMAF management.","This systematic review examines the management of bilateral mandibular angle fractures (BMAF), a rare and complex subset of mandibular fractures, which predominantly affect young males and are often associated with impacted third molars.

In 2005 this legal requirement for dual registration with both regulators was removed. During 2021 the authors surveyed UK OMFS specialists and trainees asking them why they chose to remain on or leave the Dental Register to give context to the changing numbers of OMFS specialists and trainees holding Dental Registration between 2014 and 2023. In 2014 of 539 OMFS specialists and trainees only 62 (12%) were solely GMC registered, that is, they had let their Dental Registration lapse. In 2023, of 709 OMFS specialists and trainees, 320 (45%) were solely GMC registered. Those whose first qualification was medicine were less likely to be dually registered. Of those who replied to the survey and remained dually registered, most (40%) based this decision on ?worries about the consequences? of dropping their dental registration. Some other reasons were not based on fact at that time. Cost was the most common reason (49%) given for dropping their GDC registration by respondents who were only registered with the GMC. On the positive side, the January 2023 GDC position statement about OMFS who are not on the Dental Register removed the GDC?s previous restriction on location of practice and teaching dental students. However the statement does not unambiguously allow OMFS surgeons to practice across the full OMFS curriculum. Will the 2023 GDC position statement alter the trend of OMFS specialists and trainees towards single medical registration?","Introduction
In the United Kingdom, OMFS decided it would be a dual degree specialty in 1984, long before any legislative changes made this mandatory. Prior to 2005 all new OMFS specialists and trainees were registered with both the dental and medical regulators. When UK law changed in 2005, following a European Union Directive 1 which removed the 1995 requirement for GDC registration, 2 OMFS specialists began to drop their dental registration. The UK OMFS specialty, at several BAOMS Annual Scientific Meetings and Annual General Meetings (AGMs) over three decades, has always voted in favour of dual degree training being mandatory 345 , recognising that the knowledge and skills gained from both degrees and training are vital to deliver the highest standard of care for OMFS patients. The most extensive, expensive and external review of OMFS training, the 2008 Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board (PMETB) Review of Training in OMFS, 6 supported dual degree training and also recommended that OMFS should have a single regulator.

In 2015, when the GMC fee was £420 per year, the GDC increased its Annual Retention Fee from £576 to £890 for dentists. This jump in GDC fees caused many in OMFS to reconsider their GDC registration and triggered a mass departure. Having two regulators is expensive and has risks. 7 A survey was designed to assess why OMFS specialists and trainees to drop GDC registration, and also to look at the reasons that some surgeons retained their dental registration.

Method
During December 2021 an e-mail was sent to OMFS trainees and specialists asking the main reason that they chose to remain on the Dental Register or chose to let their Dental Registration lapse. The list of reasons was based on a small pilot study of 20 OMFS trainees and specialists. Respondents were invited to expand on their reasons if they wished. The options given were:

• Cost
• Risk of having GDC as a regulator (in principle)
• Risk of having GDC as a regulator (personal experience)
• Issues with CPD/CME with GDC (in principle)
• Issues with CPD/CME with GDC (personal experience)
Colleagues were asked to choose only one (the main) option. Many chose more than one option. Others offered additional reasons which were not on the list. The reasons were counted and presented as a percentage of the total reasons. Results were compiled on Excel® and analysed using Winstat®.

Every January from 2014–2023 Freedom of Information requests were made to view the GMC’s publicly available OMFS specialist list. These data were combined with a database of OMFS specialists and OMFS trainees. By comparing this merged database with the GDC’s online Dental Register, OMFS specialists and trainees who were and were not on the Dental Register were identified. Results were compiled on Excel® and analysed using Winstat®.

Results
Reasons for remaining on or leaving the GDC register in 2021
We received responses from 69 of 145 specialty trainees (response rate 48%). Of those replying, 50 (72%) were on both registers, 17 (25%) GMC only and for two, their status was unknown. For OMFS specialists 211 replied (response rate 43%) and of those replying 118 (58%) were on both registers and 89 (42%) were registered with the GMC only.

Table 1 summarises the replies from specialists and trainees who remained on the Dental Register. (n = 163). Not all those replying gave a reason, and some gave more than one reason. Of those replying 66 (40%) cited ‘General worries about leaving the dental register’, 27 (17%) felt that their registration was needed for DCT supervision, 23 (14%) stayed registered to support their Private Practice, 13 (8%) were ‘Proud to be a dentist’, 10 (6%) stayed on the register because it was ‘Needed for their CCT’, 9 (6%) to allow supervision of Temporarily Registered dentists and for five (3%) it was a contractual requirement. The background to these reasons will reviewed in the discussion.

GDC and GMC registration
Table 3 and Fig. 1 show the changes in dual GDC and GMC registration of OMFS specialists and trainees with time. ‘GMC only’ specialists increased year on year with the exception of 2016–17. This dip followed strong advice from the UK specialty association and the UK national training advisory body (OMFS Specialty Advisory Committee – OMFS SAC) of risks associated with giving up dental registration. The change between 2014 and 2015 is associated with the GDC’s Annual Retention Fee (ARF) almost doubling from £576 to £890. The ARF remained at £890 until 2020 when it reduced to £680. For comparison GMC annual fees ranged up and down between £390 to £420 across the same period.

Fig. 1
Changes of in number of OMFS Surgeons (specialists and trainees) with dual registration or GMC only registration 2014-2022.
As the survey took place during December of 2021, the most relevant statistics regarding the registration of OMFS specialists and trainees are from January 2022. Of 608 specialists and trainees whose gender was known, 82 (13%) were female and 526 (87%) male. There was no difference in the percentage of males and females having dual registration, with 45 females (54%) and 307 males (56%) – chi-squared 0.82.

Of 628 OMFS specialists and trainees whose first degree (medical or dental) was known, 517 (82%) were dentistry first and 111 (18%) were medicine first. Of the 111 ‘medicine first’ specialists/trainees, 50 (45%) were dually registered and 61 (55%) were GMC only. By contrast of the 517 ‘dentistry first’ OMFS surgeons, 302 (58%) were dually registered and 215 (42%) GMC only – chi-squared 0.01. For specialty trainees, of 88 ‘dentistry first’ 22 (23%) were GMC only, compared to the 59 ‘medicine first/ of whom 35 (59%) were GMC only – chi-squared 0.000. The proportion of trainees from ‘dentistry first’ and ‘medicine first’ is different in each new cohort, which may contribute to variability in trainees.

Table 4 shows the registration of specialists and trainees by region in January 2022. Training rotations and NHS regions do not quite match perfectly. In Scotland 32 (82%) of specialists are solely on the medical register, compared with 25% in Northern Ireland, East Midlands and East of England. The Southwest has the highest percentage of OMFS specialty trainees who were GMC only with five (63%) followed by Scotland and Wales with 50%. Like differences with time, regional differences for trainees may be due to variations in ‘first degree’ or could reflect advice from or influence of trainers.

Discussion
In this discussion we review the reasons given by OMFS surgeons to remain on or leave the Dental Register in the context of published information. The reason is in bold text at the start of each paragraph.

‘Worries about risks of letting registration lapse’ : there had been a lack of clarity from the GDC about what it considers is a ‘medical task’ i.e. that which it is possible for a ‘GMC only’ OMFS specialist or trainee to do. In the 2005 amendment to the Dentists’ Act 1984 8 the GDC allows a few unspecified ‘medical tasks’ that are not considered ‘dentistry’ to be carried out by non-dentally registered professionals provided they are suitably trained and regulated. The GDC’s 2019 statement 9 did not allow OMFS specialists and trainees without dental registration to practice outside an ‘OMFS setting’ but did not define what an OMFS setting was, leaving uncertainty. For example, at the start of 2022 a UK OMFS consultant received a letter from the GDC pointing out that, as they were not on the Dental Register and their private practice website stated that they could remove wisdom teeth, they may be offering ‘illegal practice of dentistry’. The 2023 GDC update 10 provides more but still incomplete clarity. It has removed the location restriction allowing OMFS specialists and trainees to undertake ‘medical tasks’ in other settings. It says “ The GDC considers that a qualified person who is registered with one of the other statutory healthcare regulators should use their professional judgement to determine whether it is appropriate for them to practise dentistry using the medical task exemption when not registered with the GDC. This should involve assessment of whether the dentistry to be delivered is a necessary part of wider clinical care. The GDC’s expectation is that patient safety remains paramount. ” The statement falls short of saying ‘medical tasks’ are defined by a regulated professional’s curriculum which would allow OMFS surgeons to practice all ‘dental’ procedures within the OMFS curriculum.

Without absolute clarity from the GDC or a change in the law, 11 it is likely that worries will persist for OMFS surgeons.

‘Supervising Dental Core Trainees (DCT)’: the UK Committee of Postgraduate Dental Deans and Directors (COPDEND) who administer and co-ordinate DCT training 12 do not require trainers and clinical supervisors to be dentally registered. Although this is made clear in BAOMS documentation including BAOMS/COPDEND Joint Position Statements 1314 this false belief persists.

‘Teaching dental students’ : at the time of the survey, based on the 2019 GDC position statement, 9 OMFS specialists and trainees were not allowed to teach dental students at all. The January 2023 GDC statement 10 allows medically registered OMFS to teach dental students all of the OMFS curriculum.

‘Supervising temporarily registered dentists’ : only a registered dentist can be the named supervisor temporary registrants 15 (dentists whose dental qualification is not registerable in the UK). This means that if an OMFS unit wishes to be able to employ a temporary dental registrant, at least one member of staff must be on the Dental Register. In January 2023 a change to the GDC website says temporary dental registrants cannot practice in the medical specialty of OMFS. 1516

‘Private practice’ : Location of private practice was limited at the time of the survey to an ‘OMFS setting’ but the 2023 GDC statement does not limit OMFS practice by its location. Performance of an extraction for a patient not referred by a dentist (self-referred or referred by medical practitioners) and which is not part of other medical care may remain ‘illegal practice of dentistry’.

‘Oral surgery (OS) specialist list’ : OMFS specialists must maintain Dental Registration to join or remain on the GDC’s OS specialist list. The 1998 Statutory Instrument 17 grants a legal right for OMFS specialists to gain entry onto the OS List by Route 4. 1819202122

‘Problems with the GDCs requirements for Continuing Professional Development (CPD)’: the requirements for CPD for dentists are defined in a Statutory Instrument. 23 The GDC does not offer flexibility. A number of OMFS trainees and specialists have had notices of erasure linked to their CPD/CME documentation which was satisfactory for their medical appraisal but were not in the GDC’s required format. This problem will continue without legislative change.

‘Needed for Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT)’: dental registration is not required for CCT. 24 Instead, trainees must demonstrate that their dental degree is potentially registrable or they are fully registered. The GMC has allowed at least two OMFS trainees whose dental qualifications were from outside the EU and who had not completed the Overseas Registration Examination ORE) to join the OMFS specialist.

‘Risk of having two regulators’ : There is undoubtedly a risk associated with having two regulators 7 and this will persist until there is a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the GMC and GDC for the management of complaints made about dually registered OMFS surgeons. Alternatively OMFS should follow the 2008 PMETB 6 recommendation of the having the GMC as its single regulator.

Conclusions
Whilst the data about dental and medical registration of OMFS specialists and trainees are comprehensive, the response rate of less than 50% is not ideal even if this survey of OMFS specialists and trainees in the UK is one of the largest ever published.

The cost of GDC registration is the most common reason given by OMFS surgeons for letting their GDC registration lapse, followed by the risk of having two regulators.

In the survey, some reasons given by OMFS surgeons for remaining on the dental register were not fact-based at that time. Others were valid (location of care and teaching dental students) but are no longer relevant as they have been removed by the GDC’s 2023 position statement. 11

Until there is more clarity from the GDC or legislative change, it would seem that the primary reason of retaining GDC registration of ‘General worry about letting their registration lapse’ continues to be valid.

Almost half the OMFS profession in the UK are only registered with GMC. The GDC’s 2023 position statement does not allow OMFS surgeons to practice across the entire OMFS curriculum but rather asks professionals without GDC registration to ‘self-regulate’. It is hoped that this paper will encourage OMFS specialists and trainees to review the GDC’s 2023 position statement and consider how it applies to them.

In the aftermath of Brexit, there will be a significant amount of rewriting of legislation to remove references to European Union legislation. This may offer OMFS a once-in a-lifetime opportunity to approach the government to provide legal clarity and allow the specialty to prosper. 12 We hope that this paper and our editorial will stimulate discussion 16 and promote engagement of all the relevant stakeholders.

We have no conflicts of interest.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission
None needed.","This study examines the evolution and current status of dual registration among Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) specialists and trainees in the UK, highlighting the ongoing debate over maintaining registration with both the General Dental Council (GDC) and the General Medical Council (GMC). Historically, OMFS became a dual degree specialty in 1984, with all new specialists registering with both regulatory bodies. Legislative changes in 2005, following an EU directive, allowed for deregistration from the GDC, prompting a gradual shift away from dual registration. Despite these changes, the specialty has traditionally endorsed dual registration, arguing that the combined expertise from both dental and medical training is essential for optimal patient care.

A survey conducted in December 2021 among OMFS professionals revealed that 72% of trainees and 58% of specialists maintained dual registration, while 25% of trainees and 42% of specialists were registered solely with the GMC. Respondents who retained their GDC registration cited reasons such as general concerns about the implications of dropping dental registration, requirements for supervising Dental Core Trainees, and the necessity for private practice accreditation and specialist list membership. Conversely, those who allowed their GDC registration to lapse primarily pointed to increased costs, the perceived risks of operating under two regulatory regimes, and challenges with continuing professional development (CPD) requirements.

The research underscores regional differences and varying practices based on whether the professionals’ first degree was in dentistry or medicine. Recent modifications in GDC guidelines (2023) have addressed some issues, yet uncertainties remain. The study calls for clearer regulatory frameworks or a unified regulator to support OMFS professionals, especially in light of legislative changes post-Brexit.","This research paper investigates the reasons behind Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) specialists and trainees in the UK maintaining or relinquishing their General Dental Council (GDC) registration. A survey conducted in 2021 revealed that cost was the primary driver for dropping GDC registration, followed by concerns about having two regulators (GMC and GDC). Conversely, those retaining GDC registration cited general worries about its absence, need for supervising dental core trainees, or supporting private practice.

Analysis of GMC and GDC registration data from 2014-2023 shows a steady increase in OMFS surgeons registered solely with the GMC, particularly after a significant rise in GDC fees in 2015. Regional variations and differences between surgeons with initial medical versus dental degrees were also noted. The paper discusses the ambiguity of the GDC's guidelines, which had previously restricted practice to 'OMFS settings'. The authors conclude that cost and regulatory duplication influence the GDC registration status for OMFS surgeons. They highlight the need for legislative clarity and encourage OMFS professionals to review the GDC's updated position statement.","This study investigates the reasons why UK oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) specialists and trainees choose to retain or relinquish their General Dental Council (GDC) registration, given the dual-degree nature of the specialty. OMFS, which requires both medical and dental qualifications, has seen a significant decline in dual registration since 2005, when EU legislation removed the mandatory requirement for GDC registration. The study, conducted via a survey in December 2021, collected responses from 69 trainees and 211 specialists, revealing that 72% of trainees and 58% of specialists retained dual registration, while 25% of trainees and 42% of specialists were registered only with the General Medical Council (GMC).

The primary reasons for retaining GDC registration included general concerns about the risks of deregistration (40%), the need to supervise dental core trainees (17%), and support for private practice (14%). Conversely, the main reasons for relinquishing GDC registration were cost (49%) and the risks associated with dual regulation (24%). The study also highlighted regional variations in registration patterns, with Scotland having the highest proportion of GMC-only specialists (82%).

The GDC’s 2023 position statement provided some clarity, allowing OMFS specialists to perform ""medical tasks"" outside traditional OMFS settings and teach dental students. However, ambiguity remains regarding the definition of ""medical tasks"" and the scope of practice for non-dentally registered OMFS surgeons. The study concludes that while cost and regulatory risks drive many to drop GDC registration, ongoing concerns about legal and professional uncertainties persist. The authors advocate for legislative changes to clarify the scope of practice for OMFS surgeons and suggest that Brexit may offer an opportunity to address these issues. The findings aim to stimulate discussion and engagement among stakeholders to ensure the specialty’s future prosperity.",6,3.9,19.16,,,92,94,10,100,83,88,15,95,85,90,10,98
Hemmi2024,Synergistic effect of zoledronate and compressive force suppresses proliferation and differentiation of human gingival fibroblasts,"Hemmi, Tomoharu; Yusa, Kazuyuki; Ishikawa, Shigeo; Takano, Hiroshi; Fukuda, Masayuki; Iino, Mitsuyoshi",2024,British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,10.1016/j.bjoms.2023.10.018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2023.10.018,"We investigated the effects of zoledronate (ZA) and compressive force, separately and in combination, on the proliferation and differentiation of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) to verify the mechanism underlying medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). The addition of 100¬†¬µM ZA markedly inhibited cell proliferation. Expression of type I collagen, fibroblast growth factor 2, and connective tissue growth factor genes, was decreased by ZA and compressive force. Similar results were observed for collagen expression by using Sirius red staining. These results, together with clinical findings that MRONJ is more common in cases with excessive mechanical stress on the oral mucosa, suggest that bisphosphonates such as ZA and mechanical stress may act in conjunction as risk factors for the development of MRONJ by affecting homeostasis of the oral mucosal tissues, including HGFs.","Introduction
Bisphosphonates (BPs) are analogues of pyrophosphatases, which inhibit bone resorption by inducing osteoclast apoptosis, and thus affect bone remodelling. 1 Because of these pharmacological properties, BPs, including zoledronate (ZA) are indicated for diseases such as osteoporosis and bone metastasis of malignant tumours. Adverse effects of BP include medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). 2 MRONJ is generally refractory to treatment, worsening a patient’s quality of life by affecting multiple oral-specific complaints, including pain and problems with speech. 2

In the oral mucosa the connective tissue is composed of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and extracellular matrix components, especially type I collagen ( COL1 ), 3 produced by HGFs. 4 Keratinocytes use this connective tissue as a scaffold to form an epithelial and keratinising layer that acts as the physicochemical barrier on alveolar bone. 4 Additionally, the oral mucosa is exposed to constant mechanical stresses caused by occlusion and mastication. 5 Although moderate mechanical stress is considered indispensable for maintaining homeostasis by inducing HGF proliferation, which enhances the expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) at the gene and protein level, 6 excessive mechanical stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various dental diseases because of its effect on the oral mucosa and alveolar bone remodelling. 7 Moreover the oral mucosa protects the jawbone from oral bacteria, 4 so its loss may allow bacteria to reach the jawbone, and this may be related to the development of MRONJ.

BPs are thought to have a role in the development of MRONJ by suppressing osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and epithelial cells, including keratinocytes. 8910 Our previous study revealed that compressive force and ZA inhibit both osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. 11 However, the effects of BPs on the oral mucosa which, along with the jawbone, makes up the alveolar portion of the mouth, are unclear. We know of no studies to date that have examined the combined effect of mechanical stress and BPs on the oral mucosa.

This study therefore investigated the effects of BPs and mechanical stress on the proliferation and differentiation of HGFs with a view to verifying the mechanism underlying MRONJ.

Material and methods
Evaluation of cell proliferation and observation of cell morphology
HGVs (ScienCell Research Laboratories) were cultured in fibroblast medium (containing 10% foetal bovine serum, fibroblast growth supplement, and 100 U/ml penicillin/100 µg/ml streptomycin, ScienCell Research Laboratories). Zoledronate (ZA, Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in the medium according to the concentration of BP in each experiment. HGFs were seeded at a concentration of 2 × 10 4 /well in six-well tissue culture plates (collagen type 1-coated microplate, Iwaki, Japan) and cultured for 24 hours. Then, ZA (0, 10, 100 μM) was added to the medium. Cell proliferation was evaluated on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after the addition of ZA. An MTS assay (CellTiter 96 AQ One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay Kit, Promega) was used for evaluation, and absorbance was measured using Varioskan Flash 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The measurement wavelength was 490 nm. Cell morphology, under the culture conditions described above, was observed under an inverted microscope (Zeiss Primovert, Zeiss).

Application of compressive force
HGFs were seeded at 1 × 10 5 /well in six-well plates (collagen-type 1-coated microplate). After a 24-hour incubation, ZA (0, 10 μM) was added to the medium. A compressive force of 2.0 g/cm 2 was applied for 24 hours following the method described by Ichimiya et al. 12 After removal of the stress, incubation was continued for 24 hours in the gene expression experiment and for 72 hours in the Sirius red-staining experiment.

Gene expression of HGFs
HGFs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (Dulbecco's PBS, Cell Science & Technology Institute Inc) and were then detached with trypsin-EDTA (Trypsin-EDTA solution: 0.25%, Sigma–Aldrich). The number of cells was adjusted to 10 3 –10 5 per sample. DNA was extracted using the Kaneka Easy DNA Extraction Kit Version 2 (Kaneka Corp). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed using TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (Takara Bio Inc) and CFX96 (Bio Rad). Gene expression levels were calculated using the ΔΔCt method with reference to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The primers used (Perfect Real Time, Takara Bio Inc.) were for genes encoding COL1 , fibroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF2 ), connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ), and GAPDH .

Sirius red staining
Sirius red staining was performed to examine the effects of compressive force and ZA on collagen production by HGFs. 13 After the incubation period, the medium was aspirated and the cells dried at room temperature for 24 hours, after which they were reacted with Sirius red stain (Polysciences Inc) for 60 minutes and washed with 0.1 N HCl. The stain was then dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH, and the absorbance measured at 540 nm using a Varioskan Flash 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Cell proliferation ability under the same culture conditions was evaluated using the MTS assay, and cell morphology and staining were observed using an inverted microscope.

Statistical analysis
The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check for normality for all continuous variables obtained ( n = 5–9). As non-normality was confirmed, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used for analysis, and the Bonferroni method was used for multiple testing correction. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with EZR version 1.60 (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan).

Results
Effect of ZA on cell proliferation and cell morphology
The control and 10 μM ZA samples showed similar trends in terms of cell proliferation, but the addition of 100 μM ZA markedly suppressed the cell proliferation of HGFs ( Fig. 1 ). In terms of cell morphology, the control and 10 μM ZA had little impact on the spindle-shaped characteristic of fibroblasts, while the addition of 100 μM of ZA caused HGFs to exhibit a spherical shape from day three, with many detached dead cells observed on day seven ( Fig. 2 ).

Effect of compressive force and ZA on gene expression of HGFs
As demonstrated in Fig. 3 a, the expression of COL1 genes was reduced by compressive force (89.1%), but the reduction was not statistically significant. The addition of ZA, and the combined effect of ZA and compressive force, significantly down-regulated COL1 gene expression by HGFs (65.6% and 61.6%, respectively). FGF2 showed down-regulation by compressive force (41.0%: non-significant), and ZA (4.0%) which was statistically significant. The synergistic effect of both compressive force and ZA showed a significant reduction in FGF2 gene expression (1.6%) ( Fig. 3 b). As for CTGF , although the difference is not significant, compressive force decreased the gene expression (55.8%). ZA weakened CTGF expression (9.3%) which was significant when compared with the compressive force alone. Further diminishing was observed by the combination of compressive force and ZA (3.4%), and the difference was significant when compared with the control and compressive force ( Fig. 3 c). The most repressive gene expression of HGFs when compressive force and ZA were applied simultaneously was common to all three genes.

Sirius red staining
During the incubation period, no significant effects of compressive force and ZA on the proliferation of HGFs were observed. In the absence of ZA addition, there was no marked change in collagen production by HGFs when compressive force was applied. On the other hand, the addition of ZA significantly attenuated collagen production, which was further weakened by the addition of compressive stress ( Figs. 4 and 5 ).

The absorbance was attenuated by ZA and was markedly reduced by the addition of compressive force to ZA. Values represent median, interquartile range, maximum and minimum (n = 9). * p < 0.05. ** p < 0.01.
From the above results, it is speculated that the observed attenuation of collagen expression by ZA administration and compressive stress is not due to the inhibition of cell proliferative capacity.

Discussion
The clinically specific finding of MRONJ is osteonecrosis of the jaw with soft tissue defects, which suggests that disruption of homeostasis in oral soft tissue may influence its development. Oral soft tissues are exposed to intermittent mechanical stresses from tooth contact and denture bases due to mastication, 61214 and the organ is subjected to various forces such as tension and shear stress. 15 While mechanical stress is thought to have an important role in maintaining homeostasis in periodontal tissue, 6 it exacerbates various oral diseases, such as periodontitis and peri-implantitis, when it is excessive. 12 In this study, based on the assumption that the oral mucosa is subjected to mechanical stresses, for example, from mastication and denture bases, we examined the effects of compressive force and ZA on the proliferation and differentiation of HGFs. Our findings suggest that ZA and mechanical stress may act in conjunction to affect homeostasis of the oral mucosal tissues, which may promote the development of MRONJ.

According to the user instructions provided by with Zometa® (Novartis), the maximum concentration of ZA in serum in an adult human body within 15 minutes of administration (4 mg) is estimated to be 1.47 µM. The concentration is considered to be higher by the rate of uptake of drug by bone. 16 ZA concentrations exceeding 10 µM significantly inhibit proliferation of HGFs. 17 Li et al reported that compressive force exerted on osteocytes enhanced RANKL mRNA and protein expression and thus promoted osteoclast differentiation. 18 In addition, Ichimiya et al revealed that compressive force may be an aggravating factor for temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis, since mRNA and protein expression of RANKL were enhanced when a compressive force of 2.0 g/cm 2 was applied to synovial cells in the same way as was used in the present study. 12 Based on the results of these previous studies, the ZA concentrations were set to 0 (control), 10, and 100 µM, and a compressive force of 2.0 g/cm 2 was applied.

The results of this study confirm that high concentrations (100 µM) of ZA significantly inhibit the proliferation of HGFs, which is in accordance with previous reports. 1920 As cell proliferation of HGFs is regulated through the SMAD-mediated TGF-β signalling pathway, 17 the inhibition of HGF proliferation by BPs may also be caused by the inhibition of SMAD-mediated signalling: phosphorylation of Smad2/3. 1721

FGF2 is a major differentiation marker of fibroblasts and is involved in the formation of benign granulation tissue, which is indispensable in wound healing. 22 The results of this study confirm that gene expression of FGF2 is attenuated by the addition of ZA and compressive stress to HGFs. Imada et al reported that local use of FGF2 in vivo can prevent the development of MRONJ after tooth extraction. 23 Together with the results of this study, it is suggested that reduced expression of FGF2 in HGFs may be involved in the development of MRONJ.

CTGF is a growth-promoting factor for connective tissue that affects bone remodelling by promoting the differentiation and proliferation of osteoblasts and epithelial cells. 24 CTGF also functions in a complementary manner to FGF2 and consequently regulates the homeostasis of soft and hard tissues. 1424 Manzano-Moreno et al examined the effects of several BPs, including ZA, on the function of HGFs, and reported that the expression of FGF2 and CTGF was decreased, as was also seen in the present study. 14 The results of the present study demonstrated that expression of FGF2 and CTGF in HGFs was markedly reduced by the additive effects of compressive force and ZA, suggesting that the paracrine-mediated and autocrine-mediated collagen production of HGFs could have been influenced by these stimuli.

COL1 gene expression and protein production by HGFs are suppressed by BPs. 17 Komatsu et al reported that this is regulated by TGF-β signalling, as is cell proliferation. 17 Mechanical stress also affects the function of fibroblasts through TGF-β signalling, 25 mediated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a mechanosensor of these cells. 2627 Nan et al reported that COL1 gene expression and protein production of HGFs under compression are mediated by this pathway. 6 The results of the present study indicate that COL1 expression was significantly suppressed by the addition of 10 μM ZA, a concentration that does not affect HGF proliferation. The same tendency was found with Sirius red staining experiments. Furthermore, the combined action of compressive force and addition of ZA tended to attenuate COL1 expression and significantly decrease collagen production. These findings imply that mechanical stress, which normally enhances collagen production by HGFs, may act in a suppressive manner when combined with BPs.

The results of this study indicate that the combined effects of compressive force and ZA may significantly impair the function of HGFs, including their collagen production, but not their proliferation or morphology. Although it is speculated that ZA and compressive force affect the signalling of different pathways, 17212627 it remains to be elucidated why the combined effects, compared with compressive force alone, impaired the gene expression and collagen production of HGFs. More detailed experiments to explain the precise mechanism will be needed. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the effects of BP combined with mechanical stress on the proliferation and differentiation of HGFs, the present study therefore is novel in this respect. Our results indicate that their combined effect can have a negative impact on the oral mucosal barrier. Our results support the hypothesis that mechanical stress in the oral cavity is a possible cause for the organ-specific occurrence of MRONJ.

The limitations of this study include a lack of temporal measurement of gene expression by HGFs after the loading of compressive force, and the absence of confirmation of the effects on protein expression of COL1 , FGF2 , and CTGF . In reports of the loading of mechanical stress on oral soft tissues and jaw bones in vivo, methods that have used dentures and metal frameworks in rats 28 and the application of traction by wires have been described. 29 However, it is not clear whether these methods reflect the mechanical stresses due to occlusion and denture bases in humans. Future studies therefore should construct an in vivo research model to address this question.

Conclusions
Based on our results and the clinical findings that MRONJ is more common in cases of excessive mechanical stress on the oral mucosa, we speculate that the combined effects of BPs and mechanical stress may contribute to the development of MRONJ by affecting homeostasis of the oral mucosal tissues, including HGFs.

Conflict of interest
We have no conflicts of interest.

Statement of clinical relevance
Our research provides clinical insights that eliminating excessive mechanical stress may contribute to the prevention of MRONJ.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patient permission
Not applicable.","This study investigates how bisphosphonates (BPs), specifically zoledronate (ZA), and mechanical stress together influence human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and thereby potentially contribute to medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). BPs are used clinically to treat osteoporosis and bone metastases by inhibiting osteoclast activity; however, their adverse effect of inducing MRONJ is a significant clinical challenge. HGFs, which produce type I collagen (COL1) and growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), are critical for maintaining the oral mucosal barrier.

In the study, HGFs were cultured on collagen-coated plates and treated with ZA at concentrations of 0, 10, and 100 μM. A compressive force of 2.0 g/cm² was applied to simulate mechanical stress similar to that encountered during mastication or denture use. The researchers evaluated cell proliferation, morphology, gene expression of COL1, FGF2, and CTGF, and collagen production using assays including MTS and Sirius red staining.

Results indicated that while 10 μM ZA did not significantly affect HGF proliferation, a higher concentration (100 μM) led to marked suppression of cell growth and altered cell morphology. Moreover, both ZA and compressive force—individually and in combination—significantly downregulated the expression of COL1, FGF2, and CTGF, leading to reduced collagen synthesis. These findings suggest that the synergistic effects of ZA and mechanical stress impair HGF function and disrupt oral mucosal homeostasis, potentially playing a key role in the development of MRONJ. The study underscores the clinical importance of minimizing excessive mechanical stress in patients receiving BP therapy.","This study investigates the combined effects of bisphosphonates (BPs), specifically zoledronate (ZA), and mechanical stress on human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). HGFs are crucial for oral mucosa integrity, producing type I collagen (COL1) and providing a barrier against bacteria. The researchers hypothesized that BPs and mechanical stress, such as that from chewing or dentures, synergistically disrupt HGF function.

In vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of ZA and compressive force on HGF proliferation, morphology, gene expression (COL1, FGF2, CTGF), and collagen production. High ZA concentrations inhibited HGF proliferation and altered their morphology. Combining ZA with compressive force significantly downregulated the expression of genes related to collagen production and wound healing (FGF2, CTGF) and reduced collagen synthesis. These findings suggest that BPs and mechanical stress impair HGF function, potentially compromising the oral mucosal barrier and contributing to the development of MRONJ. The study concludes that reducing excessive mechanical stress in the oral cavity might help prevent MRONJ.","This study investigates the effects of bisphosphonates (BPs), specifically zoledronate (ZA), and mechanical stress on human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) to understand their role in medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). MRONJ, a severe side effect of BP therapy, is characterized by jawbone necrosis and soft tissue defects, often exacerbated by mechanical stress from mastication or dentures. The study examined how ZA and compressive force impact HGF proliferation, gene expression, and collagen production, key factors in maintaining oral mucosal integrity.

Results showed that high concentrations of ZA (100 μM) significantly inhibited HGF proliferation and altered cell morphology, while lower concentrations (10 μM) did not affect proliferation but reduced collagen production. Mechanical stress alone did not significantly impact HGFs, but when combined with ZA, it further suppressed the expression of genes related to collagen production (COL1), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Sirius red staining confirmed that ZA and compressive force together significantly reduced collagen production by HGFs.

The findings suggest that mechanical stress and ZA synergistically impair HGF function, potentially disrupting the oral mucosal barrier and contributing to MRONJ development. This study highlights the importance of minimizing excessive mechanical stress in patients undergoing BP therapy to prevent MRONJ.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) encompass a spectrum of conditions affecting the joint, muscles of mastication and their associated structures. TMD is multifactorial and can significantly affect patients’ activities of daily living and quality of life. 1

The highest prevalence of TMD is found in women aged 20 to 40 years. 2 Additional factors such as stress, trauma and anatomical variations may contribute to onset and severity. 3 Diagnosis and management of TMD poses significant challenges to healthcare professionals due to the diverse nature of symptoms and conflicting treatment modalities. 4

Despite advancements in diagnostic techniques and treatment options, understanding the experience of patients suffering from TMD remains paramount. Qualitative research allows exploration of patients’ perspective by delving into their lived experience. This systematic review aims to synthesise the qualitative experiences of TMD patients using thematic synthesis, placing the condition into context with respect to its impact on patients and their interaction with healthcare professionals.

Material and methods
The systematic review was conducted according to the protocol registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023473091). The study was completed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA) guidelines. 5

Search strategy
A systematic literature search was performed on 1 December 2023 using the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsychInfo (American Psychological Associated) and the Cochrane Library. Searches were conducted in English, and the general search strategy was adapted for each database ( Appendix A ). No restrictions on publication date were imposed; however, only articles available in the English language have been included. Reference lists of included studies have been iteratively searched to identify additional articles. Selection criteria is presented in Table 1 .

Data collection and synthesis
Two reviewers (SC and OJ) independently screened titles and abstracts then analysed the remaining full articles according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third reviewer (AR) resolved discrepancies between reviewers. Case reports, in vitro studies, recruitment, full texts not available in English, review articles and systematic reviews were also excluded. Quantitative studies were not included as they do not provide the depth of experience afforded by interviews.

The articles were imported to NVivo software, and the data was synthesised. 6 Line-by-line coding of the identified full texts according to meaning and context was undertaken by SC. Subsequently authors (SC, OJ, AR, SR, KF) analysed the codes to generate higher-level themes. All authors agreed on the final over-arching themes through group discussion and reflection. This ensured triangulation of the data to avoid subjective interpretation of the findings.

Quality assessment
Two reviewers (SC and AR) independently undertook quality assessment. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative studies 7 has been used to assess the quality of articles. This checklist comprises 10 questions to assess the three key sections (study validity, summary of results, and applicability). Studies were not excluded based on of quality, but rather acknowledged and discussed ( Appendix B ).

Results
Study selection
The literature search identified 424 records across the five databases excluding duplicates. Following screening of references a further 15 articles were identified. Of these 439 articles, 13 met the inclusion criteria for the review ( Figure 1 ).

Results of thematic synthesis
Two themes and six subthemes were identified from the 13 included studies ( Table 3 ). Two key themes emerged as the overarching lived experience from the studies: (1) Impact and (2) Coping. An array of subthemes relating to both themes were generated.

Theme 1: Impact
Due to the chronicity of the disorders and challenges it poses on daily activities the first theme presented is impact. Patients’ experience of TMD varies widely and so does its impact, illustrated by the following two subthemes.

Subtheme 1.1: Physical health
The severity of pain related to TMD varies; however, some patients’ pain is unrelenting, impacting their everyday functioning. “It can get pretty bad. To the point where it interferes with my ability to think, if that makes sense. It’s just so painful that I . . . it’s hard to think about things and I just want to kind of be left alone. ” 9 Due to dysfunction of the jaw and restricted movement patients can find eating challenging. “I am avoiding certain things at times. Anything that takes a lot of chewing power, it almost frightens me to want to eat it, so I’ll go get something softer.” 13

TMD is commonly relapsing and remitting with individuals suffering from symptom ‘flare-ups.’ This uncertainty leaves patients waiting for further flare-ups with a sense of dread. “ If there is a pattern I haven’t been able to notice it. Foods that I eat comfortably one day, another day might cause my jaw to lock. So, no, I haven’t been able to discern a pattern. ” 9 Others have anxiety regarding their physical symptoms and catastrophise about a more serious pathology. “Deep down, I think, in the back of my mind I was thinking what is really going on, is it something more serious than I really thought. You know, because of it lasting for so long. ” 14 Many worry that their symptoms will worsen with time and that the condition is progressive. “I mean, will it always be like this? Will it get worse and worse? ” 8 The physical symptoms and behavioural changes can impact intimacy. “We can’t cuddle in a normal way, and if we want to fool around or hug each other, I can’t because of the back of my neck. Kissing is impossible. I can’t because of my jaw. So we just give each other small pecks. ” 15

Subtheme 1.2: Psychological wellbeing
Low mood, irritability, and anxiety were frequent self-reported side effects of TMD: “I used to be a happier person. Now, I’m easily irritated. In the past, if something at school seemed a bit boring, I just stuck with it. I just don’t have the energy now.” 15 The impact of symptoms often left patients feeling isolated, resulting in social anxiety for fear of pain or relapsing. “I think parents and parents-in-law were just fed-up of this woman that was always in pain. Always in the corner, you know, at a party taking painkillers and drinking water rather than having fun. ” 16 Some participants understand the role of stress in the disorder and the perpetuating cycle that can occur. “ The more the more stressed I am, the more I grind, and the more TMJ pain I have. ” 13

In addition to daily activities, sleep was also affected for several individuals. Instead of having challenges getting to sleep or disrupted sleep, patients described having “ vivid dreams ” involving their jaw and teeth. 12 Others had their parafunctional habits punctuating their dreams. “I still have dreams where I might be grinding, and I kind of describe it like I’m dislocating my jaw in my dreams. ” 13

A requirement for sick leave was commonly reported, impacting occupation, education, and finances. “A few months ago I was calling into work sick a lot … I feel stupid sometimes, feeling like I have to call in sick from jaw pain. It’s just one of those things I want to be able to try and push through.” 13 Others sought consultations and treatments, which had financial implications in the search for resolution. Some declared bankruptcy or sold their house to cover treatment costs. 11

Theme 2: Coping
Temporomandibular disorder can be a chronic condition that can affect patients for many years and significantly influence their everyday lives. Four subthemes present patients’ coping mechanisms.

Understanding the disease
Many patients encountered had a poor understanding of the aetiology of TMD and questioned possible triggers. One woman related her jaw problem to an ankle fracture, which changed her body posture. 17 Others questions the structural integrity of the joint suspecting an impossible sequence of events. “ For a time, it (the click) changed and it sounded really brittle, that’s when it scared me a bit. I was like, ‘has the bone worn down to the point where it’s really fragile and could break?’” 13

In contrast, others understood the chronic nature of TMD and felt at ease with the diagnosis. “Most people have a clicky knee or a clicky ankle, I’ve just got the clicky jaw.” 13 Patients often found relief in receiving a diagnosis after a lengthy search, and this itself acted as a coping mechanism. “ That did give me a lot more confidence because, one, he believes me; two, that I actually have a name to something. Because half the time when there's something that you think is wrong, and no one believes you, and then all of a sudden they say, ‘yes, it's got a name.’ Well, you do feel better.” 18 Those with an understanding of TMD can often find acceptance and can move on with their life. “In some way I’ve accepted that you aren’t always at your best. You can’t always feel so great. It’s just sometimes like this.” 17

Experience of healthcare professionals
TMD is a complex group of disorders with high levels of diagnostic uncertainty for health professionals. A lack of knowledge from some professionals often shapes a patients’ experience. “My dentist knows that it hurts when I open my mouth, and that I cannot open my mouth widely. He never said anything about it. Probably, I also never discussed it explicitly with him. He never suggested any treatment.” 12 Others are unsure where to access care stating they have “ looked high and low. ” 17 Patients are sent to different healthcare professionals, often feeling trapped without receiving adequate care. “And so I was in some intense pain . . . and it was so funny because as soon as I got to the doctors they tell me I should go to the dentist, and then as soon as I go to the dentist they tell me they can’t do anything for me, I have to go back to the doctors.” During patients’ quest for care they could receive negative responses from healthcare professionals. “ Well, I felt terrible, especially when my GP [general medical practitioner] refused to refer me anywhere and told me I was a timewaster who was just imagining it. And, you know, not to bother him anymore.” 16

When patients successfully accessed care, there was a lack of continuity between health professionals, leading to further confusion. “I'd come in and I wouldn't be seeing my regular doctor, and I had to keep explaining myself, and on one occasion I was actually discharged from the hospital because the doctor that I normally see wasn't there.” 19 Patients received incorrect and unnecessary medical treatment from ill-informed professionals with no resolution for their TMD. “ They just kept looking at me teeth, they didn’t say anything [about a diagnosis], just kept drilling into me [sic] teeth, injections and drilling me [sic] teeth all the time.” 14 The rationale behind some treatment was not fully explained to patients, preventing them from understanding its importance . “And then they tried to knock me out, put me under, and they tried to realign my jaw thinking it had been dislocated and it was the worst experience, I felt like my jaw was just going to snap because they were putting so much force.” 19

Seeking treatment
Many individuals seek treatment for TMD regardless of severity and struggle with self-management. “If I have a physical complaint, most of the time I will go directly to the general practitioner. ” 12 Even with a diagnosis, some patients question their symptoms and search for answers. “Even last night I’d be sitting there with the water and the painkillers. It hasn’t gone away…and I still think that maybe…because maybe I should have the teeth out. Maybe it’s still a dental problem. So no I still…I do, I do worry about it. And I worry about where it’s going to go from here.” 14 Reassurance from fellow sufferers can provide relief from anxiety and make patients feel less alone in their symptoms. “I had such vague complaints; I did not have the idea that this could have to do with my jaws. But when I came into the waiting room, I saw another guy rubbing his temples. Then I thought: I am not the only one; I’m not some kind of nutcase. I am at the right place.” 12

Adapting behaviours
Patients’ report having to adapt their daily life to accommodate symptoms of TMD. “On the days I’m in pain, I feel that I can’t do certain things. I can’t cope with being with my friends because I have a headache.” 15 Much of the management of TMD involves self-management techniques, and some patients feel unable to cope. Patients are aware that without self-management, their symptoms may not improve. “ Sometimes I give my jaw a massage and I do some exercises; I know that I can help myself.” 12 “ I’ve got to the point now where I think I’ve got to do it because I can only help myself now, it’s not a case of…I could come here for the next 12 months but unless I continue to help myself it’s not going to get any better as well.” 14

Some individuals become accustomed to their symptoms and can continue with everyday activities. “At first, I was concerned, but now I am just so used to the popping.” 8 Some described their jaw as “just uncomfortable” or “annoying ”, but “manageable ” with minimal impact on their daily life, 13 however, it is unclear if this correlates with severity of symptoms.

Discussion
The impact of TMD on patients has long been appreciated but this review amalgamated the literature using thematic synthesis to analyse the experience and unmet needs of TMD patients. The themes of impact and coping are vital to understand how to support patients optimally. There are positive experiences of findings relief in diagnosis and successful use of self-management techniques.

The coping mechanisms identified show how individuals are managing their symptoms. Some sufferers found relief in receiving a diagnosis and acceptance allowed them to move on with their lives. Acceptance of chronic conditions is known to improve symptoms and is a prerequisite for successful pain management. 23 Self-management techniques help to resolve symptoms; however, prompt interventions are required as these methods are most effective in early TMD. 24 There is poor adherence to home physiotherapy techniques, so continued encouragement is needed. 25 Another coping strategy was finding relief from fellow sufferers. This is common among chronic pain conditions, 26 and support groups should be considered as a treatment modality in TMD. This review identified that patients had varying abilities to adapt to their symptoms. However, coping ability was not assessed against the severity of symptoms or diagnosis within the TMD spectrum.

Healthcare professionals lack of TMD knowledge and diagnostic uncertainty lead to an array of unmet needs. When patient concerns are left unresolved, there is a search for answers, and healthcare-seeking behaviours are found. Research examining dentists’ experience in treating TMD indicates a prevailing sense of diagnostic uncertainty and a lack of awareness regarding effective interventions, 4 which parallels the experience reported by patients. Lack of knowledge can cause some to label these patients as timewasters, compounding existing adverse psychological health and reduced quality of life. 1 Temporomandibular disorder contributes to social anxiety and isolation stemming from ongoing symptoms, which are also observed in other chronic musculoskeletal conditions. 27 However, there is a contrasting patient group with TMD and other musculoskeletal disorders who actively face their symptoms and undertake daily activities despite them. 27

The impact of TMD on individuals is vast and covers physical and psychological aspects. Hopelessness, resignation, and social isolation can be found in these individuals and patients with chronic pain and non-specific orofacial pain suffered similar issues. 2829 Poor psychological wellbeing can worsen symptoms. 30 Evaluating psychological health should be a priority for diagnosis and targeted therapy considered as a first line treatment modality to improve quality of life. 31

Strengths and limitations
The studies included in this review varied significantly. Self-reported TMD was used in four studies 8101112 posing a risk of incorrect self-diagnosis, but the decision was to include these for depth of patient experience. Studies investigating orofacial pain were not included due to their broad scope; however, this has potentially excluded relevant findings related to TMD due to the frequent overlap of symptoms and management of TMD in facial pain clinics. Methods of data analysis varied between studies, and two articles did not detail their methodology. 911 Timespan of data was vast between 1994 11 to 2023 101920 however, patient experiences and challenges remained the same, indicating that care still needs to evolve to meet the unmet needs. The included studies contained varying discussion of role of bias with some avoiding interviewer/participant relationships and others having no mention of it. 89111213141516

Temporomandibular disorders encompass a broad spectrum of diagnoses, each with distinct characteristics. Patients are often viewed, and may perceive themselves, as a homogenous group. However, treating TMD as a single entity presents challenges, as individuals with different diagnoses have varying symptoms and concerns. In the reviewed articles, seven did not distinguish between diagnoses. 9101112 Two studies focused exclusively on patients with intra-articular pathology, 1318 while four specified participants’ diagnoses. 14161719 Among these, most patients exhibited both myalgia and joint pathology, yet none analysed their findings by diagnosis. Future research should address the unique experiences and concerns of each specific TMD diagnosis.

The strength of this review lies in the rigorous analysis. Themes and subthemes were derived through separate analyses, allowing for triangulation, and enhancing the credibility of the findings. This collaborative approach ensured a comprehensive and robust data exploration, improving reliability.

Direction of future research
Further research into patients’ TMD experiences and unmet needs is required. This review helps to identify issues that might populate a patient concerns inventory for TMD. Aspects relating to diet, social activities, sleep, psychological wellbeing, and intimacy should be included in a TMD PCI. A prompt list would help identify impact and specific coping mechanisms, assessing positive and negative behaviours that contribute to the disorders.

Conclusion
This systematic review provides an insight into the experience of individuals suffering from TMD. Despite the prevalence of TMD, relatively few qualitative studies were reported. The themes identified in this review of impact and coping underscore the importance of tailored support strategies for TMD patients. Further research is needed to deepen the understanding of patients’ experiences and address their needs effectively. The evidence shows the pressing need for improved diagnostic pathways and patient-centred care when managing TMD.

TMD, a multifactorial condition affecting the temporomandibular joint and associated structures, predominantly impacts women aged 20 to 40 years and is exacerbated by factors such as stress, trauma, and anatomical variations. Despite diagnostic and treatment advances, managing TMD remains challenging due to its diverse symptom presentation and conflicting interventions.

The review followed a protocol registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023473091) and adhered to PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsychInfo, and the Cochrane Library, with 13 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. These studies, incorporating a total of 280 participants, used interviews and qualitative methods to capture the depth of patient experiences.

Thematic synthesis revealed two overarching themes: Impact and Coping. The Impact theme encompasses physical aspects—such as chronic pain, impaired jaw function affecting eating and intimacy, and physical limitations—as well as psychological issues, including anxiety, low mood, social isolation, and financial strain due to treatment costs and sick leave. The Coping theme outlines patients’ efforts to understand their condition, navigate complex healthcare systems often characterized by diagnostic uncertainty, actively seek treatment, and adopt self-management strategies.

The review highlights significant unmet needs, emphasizing the necessity for improved diagnostic pathways, enhanced patient-centered care, and support strategies including early intervention and peer support. Despite study heterogeneity and reliance on some self-reported diagnoses, the findings underscore the importance of addressing both physical and psychological dimensions in TMD management.","This systematic review synthesizes qualitative research on the lived experiences of Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) patients, examining the impact of the condition and their coping mechanisms.

The ""Coping"" theme includes understanding the disease (or lack thereof), navigating healthcare professionals (often encountering knowledge gaps and discontinuity of care), seeking treatment (despite skepticism), and adapting behaviors (altering daily routines and employing self-management techniques). The review highlights the need for tailored support, improved diagnostic pathways, and patient-centered care. It suggests future research should focus on specific TMD diagnoses and develop patient concern inventories to better address unmet needs. While acknowledging limitations like varied study methodologies and inclusion of self-reported TMD diagnoses, the review emphasizes the importance of understanding the TMD patient experience to improve care and quality of life.","This systematic review synthesizes qualitative studies to explore the lived experiences of patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD), focusing on the condition's impact and coping mechanisms. TMD, a multifactorial condition affecting the jaw joint and muscles, significantly impacts patients' quality of life, particularly women aged 20-40. The review analyzed 13 studies involving 280 participants, identifying two overarching themes: ""Impact"" and ""Coping.""

The ""Impact"" theme highlighted the physical and psychological toll of TMD. Patients reported chronic pain, difficulty eating, and anxiety about symptom progression, leading to social isolation, sleep disturbances, and financial strain due to lost work and treatment costs. The ""Coping"" theme revealed strategies such as seeking diagnoses, adapting behaviors, and relying on self-management techniques. However, many patients faced challenges due to healthcare professionals' lack of TMD knowledge, leading to misdiagnoses, inadequate treatment, and feelings of dismissal.

The review underscores the need for improved diagnostic pathways, patient-centered care, and psychological support for TMD patients. It also highlights the importance of understanding specific TMD diagnoses to tailor treatments effectively. Future research should focus on developing patient concern inventories (PCIs) to better address the physical, psychological, and social impacts of TMD.

Bone removal is often indicated in the extraction of erupted or unerupted third molars, with the main aim of facilitating the surgical procedure. 1 Nevertheless, the type of instrument used for bone removal can directly affect bone repair and consequently postoperative complications. 12 Rotating instruments are the most commonly used in tooth extractions, however, currently, with the concern to make surgery minimally invasive, sonic and ultrasonic instruments have become another alternative. 34

Several biomechanical factors are capable of affecting the temperature rise during bone removal, therefore heat generation has a multifactorial nature and should be reduced to favour bone repair. 5

Thermocouples consist of two different electrical conductors connected at the ends that create an electrical circuit with electromotive force caused by the temperature difference. 6 This device, associated with a digital thermometer, can be used in research involving the measurement of temperature variation during bone removal. 7

The purpose of this study was to compare:

1. The temperature variation produced by rotary instruments (at three different speeds) and an ultrasonic one,
2. The efficiency of two different irrigation methods (manual and mechanical),
3. The time required to perform bone removal around the teeth.
4. The investigators hypothesise that the type of instrument and its rotation speed would directly influence the temperature variation.
Material and methods
Study design and sample
For this ex-vivo study, 40 hemimandibles of adult Landrace pigs weighing approximately 110 kg were used, obtained by donation from Frigorífico Fribordogue LTDA, Rodovia Leonidas Pacheco Ferreira KM 327, Bariri-SP (Brazil). This research was started after the project was registered with the Committee on Ethics in the Use of Animals of the Faculty of Dentistry of Bauru – University of São Paulo, under registration 007/2022.

The hemimandibles remained frozen up to 12 hours before each experiment and in the 12 hours prior to the procedure they were kept in water at room temperature for thawing and hydration.

Variables
The 40 hemimandibles were divided into four groups of 10 according to the instrument to be used:

GROUP 1 – Dabi Atlante high speed turbine (400000 rpm),
GROUP 2 – Dabi Atlante implant motor with straight piece(100000 rpm),
GROUP 3 – Dabi Atlante low speed micromotor with straight part (20000 rpm),
GROUP 4 – Driller Piezosonic surgical ultrasound (100MD 50w 30 kHz).
In addition, bone removals were performed with the Dabi Atlante high rotation turbine (400000 rpm) on the antepenultimate tooth of the 40 hemimandibles to compare the efficiency of irrigation, 20 with mechanical irrigation and 20 with manual irrigation.

Thermometer accommodation
A mucoperiosteal flap was detached and the buccal cortical bone was exposed. Then, to accommodate the thermometers, using a guide, three perforations were made, with carbide drill No. 4 long stem high rotation (Angelus, Prima Dental), in high rotation, with mechanical irrigation, of 4mm of depth located 7mm from the cervical region, one in the mesial, one in the centre, and one in the distal side of the two most posterior teeth of the mandible.

However, considering the bone removals around the teeth were performed with a width of 1.8 mm (diameter of the spherical carbide drill No. 6) the temperature sensors were at a distance of 5.2 mm from this region.

Three K-type thermocouple devices associated with the respective digital multimeters with Eda Professional model 9kd-Temperature sensor were inserted in each of the previously described perforations.

Bone removal
All bone removal was performed by the same operator, in a room with a temperature of 24 °C. A periapical radiograph was taken in one of the mandibles prior to the experiment to obtain more information about the anatomy of the teeth involved. Thus, it was defined that the depth of bone removal would be based on the complete exposure of the furcation.

For instrument analysis, bone removal was performed around 80 posterior teeth (20 per group) on the buccal cortical bone of the two most posterior teeth, simulating the bone removal used to remove lower third molars (L3M) ( Fig. 1 ).

Fig. 1
Bone removal performed with Dabi Atlante implant motor with straight part (Group 2) and thermocouples in position.
In all groups, the contact of the drill with the bone was continuous and only started after the complete actuation of the foot pedal, ensuring the maximum speed of the instrument throughout the process.

To determine whether there is a temperature difference between these instruments, we standardised the irrigation method, that is, only continuous irrigation with saline solution using a 20 mL syringe and a 40 × 1.2 mm needle was used.

Spherical carbide drills No. 6 (Angelus, Prima Dental) were used for groups 1, 2, and 3. Ultrasonic bone cutting tips with five teeth (Nanning VV Dental Co Ltd) were used for Group 4. Each of the drills and saws was used to remove bone around five teeth, avoiding the increase in heat generated by the loss of cutting power of the drill or saw.

To analyse the efficiency of the irrigation method, using only the high-speed turbine, bone removal was performed on the buccal cortical around antepenultimate tooth of each hemimandible, as follows:

– Bone removal around 20 teeth with continuous manual irrigation (20 mL syringe and 40 × 1.2 mm needle),
– Bone removal around 20 teeth with mechanical irrigation.
The drills followed the same principle as in the previous step, and spherical carbides No.6 (Angelus, Prima Dental) were used.

Data collection methods
During bone removal, an assistant was responsible for recording the time, initial temperature (iT) and maximum temperature (maxT) reached in the three digital thermometers for subsequent obtaining of the temperature variation.

Temperature variation
The mean initial temperature (MiT), maximum temperature (MmaxT) and temperature variation (Δ T ) were calculated according to the following formulae:

MiT=iT1+iT2+iT33
 
∗iT1=Initialtemperatureofthermometer1
 
∗iT2=Initialtemperatureofthermometer2
 
∗iT3=Initialtemperatureofthermometer1
 
MmaxT=maxT1+maxT2+maxT33
 
∗maxT1=Maximumtemperatureofthermometer1
 
∗maxT2=Maximumtemperatureofthermometer2
 
∗maxT3=Maximumtemperatureofthermometer3
 
ΔT=MmaxT−MiT
 
Data analyses
The homogeneity and normal distribution of the data obtained were verified using the Levene’s test with a p value equal to 0.08 and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with p value equal to 0.64.

For analysis of the results, the entire sample was submitted to descriptive analysis. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed considering time as a covariate and the comparison between the instruments was made using Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner Tests (post hoc). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare groups for analysis of time. Furthermore, ANCOVA was also performed to compare irrigation methods with time as a covariate. Statistical significance was evaluated at p < 0.05.

Results
In total, bone removal was performed around 80 posterior teeth with four different instruments. The high-speed turbine and implant motor were faster and caused less temperature variation than the low-speed micromotor and the piezoelectric saw according to the mean and standard deviation values obtained ( Table 1 ).

The ANCOVA was carried out with time as a covariate and revealed that there was a statistically significant mean difference ( p = 0.01) in the temperature generated between the instruments. Although there is an apparently positive relationship between temperature and time ( Table 1 ), that is, the temperature increases proportionally to the time the instrument is applied, the differences in the mean temperatures between the instruments remain statistically significant when time is included as a covariate ( Table 2 ).

Discussion
Controlling the temperature rise during bone removal is essential to avoid harming future bone repair. 89 The aim of this study was to evaluate the temperature variation during bone removals similar to those constantly performed in the extraction of third molars with different instruments. For this, the experimental model using porcine jaws was chosen due to the similarity with the human jaw, in the posterior region, in relation to thick cortical bone and tooth formation.

There are several factors that can influence temperature rise during bone removal, such as bone density, drill cutting capacity, instrument speed, duration of injury and type of irrigation, 10 These factors should not be considered in isolation. 10

According to Szalma et al, 11 drill wear increases friction with the bone surface, causing an increase in heat production. The loss of cutting power is also associated with the increase in the time used for bone removal. 11 In addition, during the extraction of L3M, irrigation may be compromised, evidencing the need to replace the drills for thermal control, considering the difficulty of access inherent in this surgical procedure. 11 In this study, we chose to replace the drills after bone removal in the buccal cortical of five teeth so that their wear would not influence the analysis of the temperature variation of the instruments.

There is no consensus in the literature on the ideal speed for this type of bone removal. The results of this research indicated that the rotation speed influences the mean temperature variation during bone removal, higher speeds were associated with less temperature variation.

According to Bartuli et al (2013) 12 the use of high-speed turbines is considered the gold standard for bone removal in third molar extraction, allowing for reduced time and less surgical trauma.

Abouzgia and Symington (1996) 13 evaluated the increase in temperature during bone removal performed at two speeds (20000 rpm and 100000 rpm) in bovine rib samples, without irrigation and at room temperature, with type K thermocouples. The author's conclusion was similar to that of our study, using the same speeds in low rotation micromotor and implant motor. The temperature rise is lower when higher speeds are used. 13

The piezoelectric saw uses ultrasonic vibrations and has been used in dentistry and orthopaedics, mainly in delicate procedures. 1415 In general, this surgical tool is easy to handle, less invasive, safe, and accurate. 141516 Furthermore, it acts only on mineralised tissues without causing damage to soft tissues and neurovascular structures. 14 Although there are benefits inherent to this tool, care for thermal osteonecrosis cannot be left aside due to the thermal conductivity of the bone. 15 In this study, the greatest temperature variation was observed with the piezoelectric saw, in agreement with the results of Hall et al (2009). 17

Surgical time significantly influences the risk of developing postoperative complications such as: pain, swelling, and difficulty in eating and speaking. 18 In this study, we observed that the high-speed turbine contributes to the reduction of surgical time in relation to the other analysed instruments.

Irrigation is essential in controlling temperature during bone removal in dental extractions to reduce postoperative morbidity. There is not enough evidence to correlate the method and volume of irrigation with postoperative infections. 19 However, mechanical irrigation is less complicated and faster than manual irrigation with a syringe and needle. 20

The use of a thermocouple to identify changes in bone temperature is common in the literature. 20 However, the accuracy of the recording depends on the distance and depth of heat generation. 20 In this study, three K-type thermocouples were used simultaneously positioned with standardised distance and depth, increasing the homogeneity and reliability of the data.

With the results obtained, it can be concluded that the micromotor and the piezoelectric saw caused greater temperature variation than the high-speed turbine, that the irrigation method has no influence on the temperature increase during bone removal for the high-speed turbine and that the time required to perform bone removal influenced the temperature variation. Therefore, as it presents the lowest temperature variation and the shortest time required for bone removal, the use of the high-speed turbine seems to be the best choice.

Using 40 hemimandibles from adult Landrace pigs, researchers divided the samples into four groups based on the instrument applied for bone removal: Group 1 used a high-speed turbine at 400,000 rpm, Group 2 an implant motor at 100,000 rpm, Group 3 a low-speed micromotor at 20,000 rpm, and Group 4 a piezoelectric surgical ultrasound device. In addition, bone removal on one site was performed with the high-speed turbine using either manual or mechanical irrigation to assess the influence of irrigation method.

Standardized perforations were made in the buccal cortical bone for the placement of three K-type thermocouples, which recorded the initial and maximum temperatures during the procedure. Temperature variation (ΔT) was calculated by subtracting the mean initial temperature from the mean maximum temperature. Results demonstrated that instruments operating at higher speeds (high-speed turbine and implant motor) not only produced lower temperature variations but also required less time to remove bone compared to the low-speed micromotor and piezoelectric device—the latter showing the highest temperature increase and longest operating time. Statistical analyses (ANCOVA and post hoc tests) confirmed significant differences among instrument groups, with surgical time also influencing temperature changes. Conversely, the irrigation method (manual versus mechanical) did not significantly affect temperature variation. Based on these findings, the high-speed turbine is recommended for bone removal in dental extractions due to its efficiency in minimizing heat generation and reducing operative time.","This ex-vivo study investigated temperature variations, efficiency, and time required for bone removal during simulated third molar extractions, comparing rotary instruments at different speeds and an ultrasonic instrument.

Despite this, TMJR has known complications that can lead to failure. We present our experience of managing these cases and review the current evidence on the management and outcomes of alloplastic TMJR failures. Until 2015 our unit regularly used Dundee full metal prostheses, and encountered multiple issues such as infection, heterotopic bone formation, and progression of osteoarthritis beneath the condylar element. We also present our experience with other standard TMJR implants. One common cause of failure we observed is improper placement of a prosthesis due to poor technique, for instance, placement of the fossa implant too close to the ear canal can cause unresolved postoperative pain. There is no consensus on the management of TMJR, but non-surgical measures are preferred initially and surgical intervention is reserved for later stages. Recently our unit has managed numerous failure cases, employing a multidisciplinary approach combined with thorough preoperative planning and postoperative care, which has proven effective in reducing complications and improving outcomes. Based on our experience, we do not recommend the use of Dundee full metal prostheses for TMJR. Appropriate training in the placement of contemporary implants remains crucial. Suboptimal alignment of the implant in some cases does not need surgical intervention, but surgical management is justifiable in cases of persistent symptoms and functional limitations. When placing stock implants or designing a custom-made implant for an adult, we recommend that the posterior edge of the fossa component is at least 3 mm away from the bone of the ear canal.","Introduction
The incidence of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is estimated to range from 20% to 75% of the population. 1 Symptoms can affect the choice, intake, and enjoyment of food. 2 Destruction of the bony anatomy of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is due to inflammatory or destructive arthritis, and idiopathic condylar resorption. 3 Poor mouth opening can also arise as a result of TMJ destruction initiated by previous trauma to the condyle, as a complication of ablative surgery for tumours, or as a result of severe ankylosis. Patients present with limited mouth opening, facial pain, localised facial swelling, malocclusion, facial disharmony, and airway compromise, 4 which are severely debilitating and impair normal life. Pain and an inability to eat a normal diet in public reduce sociability. The impact of TMJ destruction can also be life-threatening if mouth opening is severely restricted, meaning that adequate resuscitation cannot be undertaken in the event of the airway being lost. 5

Case series
In our centre the provision of TMJ prostheses has advanced significantly, utilising various materials and designs. Metal implants, called Dundee full metal prostheses, were designed, manufactured, and placed in our unit on a regular basis up to 2015. 6 The full metal implants are thought to have been composed of cobalt 63%, chromium 29.5%, and molybdenum 5%, with trace elements of silicon, manganese, iron, nitrogen, and carbon. Zimmer Biomet (formerly Lorenz) stock implants were used in some cases, especially when full metal implants were removed. Some patients experienced late-presenting complications such as restricted mouth opening, facial pain, swelling, malocclusion, and misaligned components.

We retrospectively reviewed the late complications associated with TMJ prostheses. From our experience, the two most frequent patterns were related to full metal implants and the position of the condylar element in conventional implants.

We clinically reviewed 29 patients who received Dundee prostheses. Only eight of them still have the implants in situ. Reasons for removal varied between suspected allergic foreign-body reaction to the metals, infection, heterotopic bone formation, and progression of arthritic changes. As most Dundee prostheses did not include removal of the condyle, degenerative condylar changes were not stopped. Some patients had flattening and irregularity of the bone despite placement of a metal condylar element. In one case, failure of the metal work was associated with a defect in the glenoid fossa. In some cases, either the condyle or the fossa component was used and not both. In one case the metal condyle element was involved in breaching the bone of the glenoid fossa.

When it comes to TMJR using ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) components and other metal parts, our team reviewed a total of 30 patients who had their surgery prior to 2019. In 12 of them the fossa and/or condylar element was deemed to have been placed too close to the ear canal. In general, once the TMJR components were removed, the pain in the patient’s ear resolved. Two patients opted not to have new TMJRs placed after the original ones were removed. One TMJR was removed due to an ongoing foreign-body reaction, and another due to screws becoming loose, along with proximity to the ear canal. Only one patient with implants near the ear canal did not have pain in the area despite the ear canal narrowing. When the fossa implants were placed less that 3 mm from the ear canal bone, narrowing of the external auditory meatus was noticed on a computed tomogram (CT). Two patients opted not to have the existing implants removed despite ongoing pain in the ear. One of them reported partial relief of pain on injection of botulinum A in the ipsilateral masseter muscle, and preferred to continue these injections every four months.

On detection of a complication options were discussed with the patients. The treatments included removal and replacement of the prostheses and concurrent orthognathic surgery. In some cases restorative dentistry and/or orthodontic treatments were needed due to occlusal derangement. Seven patients required simultaneous TMJR and occlusion adjustment, which reduced pain and improved function and mouth opening. Surgical intervention was necessary for suboptimal positioning of previous prostheses, malocclusion, limited mouth opening, and pain. Some patients underwent TMJR alone, while others had simultaneous joint replacement and orthognathic surgery. In some cases multi-stage surgical treatments were required. 7 When assessing the feasibility of replacement, the design team was able digitally to erase the existing metal work to assess the amount of bone remaining. In some cases there was not enough bone to place a new implant, leading to a two-stage process.

Managing TMJR failures necessitates collaboration across specialties, including neurosurgery, otolaryngology, restorative dentistry, and orthodontics. This multidisciplinary (MDT) approach has proven essential to achieve successful, sustainable results, and our MDT offers patients the chance to seek a second opinion. The use of hilotherapy has improved postoperative pain, swelling, and comfort after surgery. 8

Collaboration with manufacturing companies using advanced 3D software has also proven effective. The 3D imaging software currently used in our unit has helped to identify some of the complex cases that may require simultaneous orthognathic surgery, and the design team has been able to use their software to inspect and plan them. All patients were informed of the clinical findings and management options by the current team members, and there has been significant appreciation from patients for their efforts.

Complications due to revision surgery included two patients needing the removal of orthognathic fixation plates due to infection. There were also three cases of marginal mandibular branch weakness and one case of permanent temporal branch palsy. Despite potential complications, however, surgical management of TMJR failure often leads to favourable outcomes, and collaboration across specialties enhances the likelihood of successful, sustainable results. Ongoing technological advancements, a focus on patient-centred care, and effective resource management, will continue to drive improvements in outcomes for our patients.

In general, TMJR has a low incidence of complications, and most can be managed successfully. 11 Recent surveys have shown incidences of revision and replacement of 3% and 4.9%, respectively 12 Bach et al identified reasons for failure, 13 and the revision or replacement rate was 1.19/100 prostheses-years. The most frequent causes of reoperation were heterotopic bone formation, with a rate of 0.44/100 prostheses-years, and surgical site infection (0.34/100 prostheses-years). In this review of modern approved systems (TMJ Concepts and Zimmer Biomet), reoperation rates for fixation/component loosening and malocclusion were exceedingly uncommon. It is known that all current systems will develop a degree of wear from usage. The global revision rate has been reported to be 1.19/100 prostheses-years.

Mercuri and Anspach reported that indications for the revision of alloplastic TMJR devices would include failed components, breakage of a component and/or fixation screws, aseptic loosening, subacute or chronic infection, osteolysis, periprosthetic bone fracture, and ankylosis caused by bone formation around the prostheses. 14 This was following the classification of orthopaedic alloplastic joint device failures. 15 Bach et al reported that the most common reason for revision was heterotopic bone formation, which is more likely in custom-made prostheses. 13 Gakhal et al reported in 2020 that revision replacements done by an experienced team result in considerably improved outcomes with limited complications, but the improvements in function and pain are not as marked as they are after primary replacement. 16

The process of TMJR can be divided into four stages: design, manufacturing, placement, and usage. At each one of these stages, factors can arise that lead to failure. The standard design for a stock implant is governed by regulations from certain bodies, like the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA). Design or manufacturing faults should be reported to the manufacturer and design team. In the USA, this would be registered in compliance with the post approval guidelines. 17 Granquist et al reported a mean (SD) age at implantation of 46.6 (12.5) years, with 86.1% being female. Data from 499 joints in 319 subjects were collected as a part of the survey. The mean (SD) follow-up time was 8.6 (3.9) years (range 2–20 years). The first subsequent surgical intervention frequency was 11.2% (4.2% removal rate and 7.0% reoperation rate). The survivorship rate (Kaplan-Meier) was 96% at 3 years, 94% at 5 years, and 86% at 10 years. The mean (SD) interval to failure using a survival function to determine the time to subsequent surgical intervention (Greenwood’s formula) was 13.5 (0.193) years. 18

Rajkumar and Sidebottom state that total TMJR gives good long-term improvements, both lessening pain and improving function, and is an effective form of management for irreparably damaged joints. 19 The management of alloplastic TMJRs should involve a MDT approach. 20 There is a degree of universal consensus on specific protocols for diagnosis, 21 and the treatment plan often depends on the patient's circumstances, the nature of the failure, and the preferences and expertise of the treating healthcare professionals.

The management of alloplastic TMJR failure varies and depends on multiple factors. The assessment of symptoms, function, and progression of the presenting complaint should be part of the regular review. CT scans and other imaging modalities might also be needed. 22 Initial management should include advice on diet, physical therapy, pain management, and pharmacological interventions. When there is mechanical failure, infection, malocclusion, or osteolysis, revision surgery, which may involve removal or replacement of the alloplastic components, may be necessary. Postoperative measures can be used to restore function and prevent complications.

Discussion of potential risks before surgery should be help to prepare the patient to manage complications, and a multidisciplinary approach is important. 23 This should include oral and maxillofacial surgeons, orthodontists, restorative dentists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, and other team members as required, including an otologist and clinical psychologist, amongst others. 7

Regular follow up of patients is advisable, and they should be reviewed annually for five years postoperatively to manage any longer-term issues that may arise. There are also guidelines for reviewing orthognathic surgery patients. 24 When orthognathic surgery is performed simultaneously the follow-up process should comply with the relevant guidelines. 25

Placement
During placement of a stock implant, the surgeon usually performs a reduction of the articulating eminence. It is recommended that the posterior edge of the fossa implant is 3 mm or more away from the bone of the auditory canal. Templates are used to determine the appropriate size of the implant to be used, and most custom-made implants can be provided with guides to facilitate placement in the pre-planned position. 26

Errors during placement might include placing the condyle implant out of the fossa component ( Fig. 1 ). If detected early, this can be addressed by a return to theatre for repositioning, but in cases of late detection, the condyle component might need to be replaced. Intraoperative dislocation of the condyle is a known issue, with an 8% risk of intraoperative dislocation of the joint, associated primarily with coronoidectomy and inflammatory arthropathy. 27 Recognising this during surgery will enable appropriate management, and treatment with elastic intermaxillary fixation is usually adequate. 28 In the case of custom-made implants, it is recommended that both components are redesigned. The design team’s software can help to assess the position of the UHMWPE component ( Fig. 2 ). Regular radiology systems do not allow the radiolucent part of the fossa component to be visualised on a 3D image.

Although this might have been caused by dislocation of the condylar element, it was determined that the occlusion had not changed from preoperative status. This excluded dislocation as the cause of the position of this condylar implant.
Infection
TMJR surgical site infections (SSIs) are uncommon, with a reported rate of 1.51% occurring over a mean of 6 months (range 2 weeks to 12 years) postoperatively. 29 Contamination of the prostheses can occur via haematogenous or localised routes. A treatment protocol suggested by Wolford et al 30 identified early infection within one month of the date of surgery. For early infection, treatment should start with broad-spectrum antibiotics, infective disease consultation, surgical intervention with drainage, debridement, and cleaning of the prostheses, and culture and sensitivity testing; also catheter irrigation with a double antibiotic solution every four hours for four to five days, removal of the infection after five days, and intravenous antibiotic therapy based on culture and sensitivity results. The protocol also recommends outpatient intravenous antibiotic therapy for four to six weeks. Removal of the prostheses is recommended when managing late infections. 31

McQuinn et al proposed an algorithm for the management of contaminated custom-made TMJRs. 32 They did not advocate the use of re-sterilisation or validation methods, which are not approved by the manufacturer, as they carry an increased risk to the patient and increased liability to the provider.

In 2012 Mercuri stated that the risk of SSI after TMJ TJR can be decreased with appropriate consideration of a preoperative risk assessment, properly timed antibiotic prophylaxis, and intraoperative, postoperative, and post discharge attention to detail. 29 Measures for prevention include preoperative optimisation or modification of potential risk factors, reduction of the patient’s bacterial burden, administration of prophylactic antibiotics, development of prosthetic device coatings that prevent or discourage the formation of biofilms, and establishment of proper surgical and postsurgical environments. 33 Our team uses antibiotic prophylaxis routinely for TMJR. Washing the wound with chlorohexidine intraoperatively also reduces inadvertent bacterial burden.

Heterotopic bone formation
There are two types of heterotopic bone formation: acquired and hereditary. Diagnosis is based on radiological findings and review of the evidence. Mercuri and Saltzman suggested that the patients at risk of forming heterotopic bone are those who have had multiple operations, those with infection, ankylosis, re-ankylosis, high-inflammatory arthritis (ankylosing spondylitis), and low-inflammatory arthritis (hypertrophic osteoarthritis); also those who have had revision of failed autogenous/alloplastic TMJR devices, and those who are uncooperative with post-implantation physical therapy. 34 Prophylactic measures that have been suggested to prevent bone formation include abdominal fat grafting, radiation, 35 diphosphonates, 36 amino-bisphosphonates, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 3738 Mercuri et al reported that the success of ionising radiation in reducing bone formation in a rat model and preventing ankylosis after total hip replacement has provided clinical validation for its use to inhibit bone formation in the TMJ. 39

Heterotopic bone can be removed from around the prostheses to allow better function. When this involves the medial aspect, removal of the prostheses may be warranted. When both components of a custom TMJR must be removed, the device typically must be re-made. 40 When suspected, a CT scan is usually diagnostic ( Fig. 3 ). CT, however, has limitations when determining soft tissue pathology, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended to diagnose disorders of the capsule, muscles, and ligaments. The patient should be offered all applicable options, including attempts to improve mouth opening with exercises and use of a tissue-stretching device, examination under anaesthetic and biopsy, and removal of bone around the implants and/or removal of the implants. Intraoperative findings will confirm the diagnosis ( Fig. 4 ), and 3D images can also help ( Fig. 5 ). Removal of the implant and heterotopic bone, along with reshaping of the mandibular condyle could provide a functional pseudo-joint ( Fig. 6 ). UHMWPE fossa components are not visible on standard 3D images ( Fig. 7 ), but the design team can use software to segment the scan data from the surrounding tissues to visualise it.

Biocompatibility
When selecting material for any prosthetic implant, biocompatibility is one of the main factors to consider. Failure due to issues relating to biocompatibility may be a result of foreign-body giant cell reactions and material hypersensitivity. In some cases, this has resulted in withdrawal of regulatory body approval. 41 There have been concerns about the biocompatibility of metals used to reconstruct the joint and about it leaching into the surrounding environment. 42 Symptoms of a lack of biocompatibility include pain, raised temperature, skin discolouration, crepitus, and tenderness. Cardiovascular, neurological, and endocrine symptoms have also been reported. 42

Osteolysis
Polyethylene wear debris-induced periprosthetic osteolysis, a major cause of failure of hip arthroplasty, 4344 is thought to be due to the migration of inflammatory cells. 45 Angelo et al reported that osteolysis is one of the factors to be considered when managing symptomatic TMJR patients. 46 Prevention measures include metal allergy testing before surgery, optimisation of the surgical technique, and regular monitoring of patients postoperatively. Regular CT scans are not usually recommended for follow up unless there are symptoms such as a worsening of pain with no other obvious cause.

Conservative measures include NSAIDs for pain management, and physiotherapy. Surgical intervention, which may be needed in cases of significant failure and symptoms, may include removing the prostheses and delayed reconstruction. In most cases the exclusion of metal allergies should be considered before further alloplastic reconstruction.

Metal-on-metal prostheses
Metal-on-metal TMJRs have been associated with a high rate of complications and foreign body reactions, 47 with 33% of Christensen prostheses (typically made of titanium or cobalt-chromium alloys) having to be explanted. 41 Metal-on-metal TMJRs can also be affected by heterotopic bone formation. When assessing the possibility of replacement, it is not usually feasible to virtually subtract the metal component on a CT scan without erasing the bone. This usually means a two-stage process to provide reconstruction, although a stock implant might be advisable if a single surgical procedure is required.

Occlusion
Occlusion should be assessed during all stages of TMJR. Sembronio et al published a protocol for fully digital and customised management of concomitant TMJR and orthognathic surgery. 48 When resecting the condyle for TMJR, this would result in detachment of the lateral pterygoid muscle, which invariably means losing the ability to protrude the mandible and move it towards the contralateral side. Failure to recognise this can impair normal chewing movements and, in some cases, lead to exaggeration of a traumatic occlusion ( Fig. 8 ). Input from an orthodontist is essential when managing these patients and a restorative dentistry opinion is recommended in cases of missing teeth that would complicate any orthognathic surgical treatment done at the same time. Custom-made 3D planned implants would be helpful when managing these cases ( Fig. 9 ).

Discussion
Consensus standards on the management of TMJR failure have yet to be achieved. A comprehensive MDT approach is needed. Symptoms including pain, swelling, trismus, redness, and facial nerve deficit should be considered, and examination of the area of concern and assessment of the head and neck should take place. Imaging modalities should include orthopantomograms, posteroanterior views of the mandible, and ultrasound scans. CT is usually needed for full assessment. 49 When a soft tissue component is suspected, an MRI scan might help. 50

Patients’ concerns and expectations should be established and addressed appropriately. The first steps in management include pain control and physiotherapy. In cases where there are signs of infection or inflammatory reactions, a biopsy of the affected tissues can help diagnosis. Microbiological investigations such as culture and sensitivity should also be considered. A MDT approach to care is recommended. This can include oral and maxillofacial surgeons, orthodontists, restorative dentists, speech and language therapists, 51 rheumatologists, 52 and other clinicians. Psychological support for the patient should also be considered, 53 mainly because revision surgery and the management of TMJR failure can be challenging emotionally. Documentation of the patient’s history, the surgical procedures performed, and the outcomes of interventions will facilitate further management. From the data available, management of TMJR failure should be individualised, and protocols, if developed, should be adjusted and based on the specific circumstances of each case.

From our point of view, the metal implants designed, manufactured, and used in our unit might not have been in line with contemporary practice in other UK units at that time. An abstract from 2011 mentions that they were designed by the OMFS and Biomechanical Engineering departments at the University of Dundee and funded by the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS). 54

Our organisation was not included in the paper published in 2009 on the status of TMJR in the UK, which covered data up to May 2007. 55 It states that “The three currently available systems are the Christensen system, the TMJ Concepts system and the Lorenz (BMF) system’’. None of these include the type of full metal implant used in some of the cases above. Abel et al reported a finite element analysis of a condylar support prosthesis to replace the TMJ. 56 The metal implants that were used in our unit seem to have some resemblance to the ones mentioned in that article.

Regarding stock TMJR implants, there is some evidence to support the use of Zimmer Biomet stock implants due to their low complication rates and long-term improvements in function and pain. 57

Results on the use of arthroscopy to manage failing TMJRs have shown promise in decreasing pain and increasing maximum interincisal opening. It has been suggested that larger studies with longer follow up are needed to further classify the different causes of prosthetic failure and to advance the approaches to management. 58 None of our patients was considered suitable for such intervention, but we would not exclude it as an option in the future.

Conclusion
The management of TMJR failure is a complex process that should involve a MDT approach. Consensus is yet to be achieved on the best protocol. Providing support to the patient is important during what can be an emotionally complicated process. Detailed documentation is recommended to facilitate further steps in management. Based on our experience, we would not recommend using the design or materials of the Dundee prostheses for TMJR. Appropriate training in the placement of the currently-used implants remains of high importance. Suboptimal alignment of the implant does not need surgical intervention in some cases, but surgical management is justifiable in case of persistent symptoms and functional limitations. When placing stock implants or designing custom-made devices for an adult, we recommend that the distance between the posterior edge of the fossa component and the bone of the ear canal is at least 3 mm.

TMJR is performed to restore function in patients with joint destruction due to inflammatory arthritis, trauma, or idiopathic condylar resorption, conditions that cause severe symptoms such as restricted mouth opening, facial pain, malocclusion, and even airway compromise. In this review, the authors present a retrospective case series from their centre, focusing on patients treated with custom full metal prostheses (Dundee implants) and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) components. The analysis reveals that complications—ranging from allergic reactions, infection, heterotopic bone formation, to implant malpositioning—are common, particularly when implant components are placed too close to the ear canal.

The study details that many patients required revision surgery or removal of implants due to issues like suspected metal hypersensitivity, mechanical failure, and progressive arthritic changes. Advanced 3D imaging and digital planning were instrumental in assessing residual bone and planning surgical interventions, often involving simultaneous orthognathic surgery for occlusal adjustments. A multidisciplinary team approach, incorporating maxillofacial surgeons, orthodontists, restorative dentists, otolaryngologists, and other specialists, proved essential for optimizing outcomes.

The authors conclude that while TMJR complications are relatively infrequent, their management is complex and must be individualized. They recommend updated implant designs and meticulous surgical technique—including maintaining a minimum 3 mm clearance from the ear canal—to minimize failures and improve patient quality of life. This comprehensive review not only synthesizes clinical data but also offers practical guidelines and future directions for enhancing safety and efficacy of TMJR procedures.","This research paper presents a retrospective review of late complications associated with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) prostheses at a single center. It highlights two frequent patterns of complications: those related to Dundee full metal implants and the position of the condylar element in conventional implants.

The review of 29 patients with Dundee prostheses showed a high removal rate due to suspected allergic reactions, infection, heterotopic bone formation, and persistent degenerative changes. Analysis of 30 patients with UHMWPE components placed prior to 2019 revealed that incorrectly placed implants in proximity to the ear canal caused pain. The paper emphasized that treatment options were discussed with patients, including revision surgery, orthognathic surgery, restorative dentistry, and orthodontics, and that simultaneous TMJR and occlusion adjustment often improved outcomes.

The paper advocates a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach involving specialists such as oral surgeons, orthodontists, otolaryngologists, and neurosurgeons. It reviews causes for TMJR failure, including infection, heterotopic bone formation, wear of the alloplastic components, malocclusion and osteolysis.

In conclusion, the authors recommended against Dundee prosthesis designs due to observed complications. They stress the importance of appropriate surgical training in the placement of current implants, advocating for a multidisciplinary, individualized approach to managing TMJR failure, with thorough patient support and documentation.","This research paper examines the management of temporomandibular joint replacement (TMJR) failures, focusing on complications, causes, and treatment strategies. Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) affect a significant portion of the population, leading to pain, limited mouth opening, and impaired quality of life. TMJR is often used to address severe TMJ destruction, but failures can occur due to factors such as infection, heterotopic bone formation, malocclusion, and biocompatibility issues. The study reviews 29 patients with Dundee full metal prostheses and 30 patients with ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) components, highlighting complications like allergic reactions, infections, and improper implant positioning.

The paper emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach (MDT) involving oral and maxillofacial surgeons, orthodontists, and other specialists to manage TMJR failures effectively. Advanced imaging techniques, such as CT and MRI, are crucial for diagnosing complications like heterotopic bone formation and osteolysis. Surgical interventions, including implant removal and replacement, are often necessary, alongside conservative measures like physiotherapy and pain management. The study also discusses the importance of proper implant placement, recommending a minimum 3 mm distance between the fossa component and the ear canal to avoid complications.

Key findings indicate that higher-speed instruments, such as the high-speed turbine, are more efficient, causing less temperature variation and reducing surgical time. The piezoelectric saw, while precise, generated the highest temperature variation. The study concludes that the high-speed turbine is the most effective instrument for bone removal, minimizing thermal damage and postoperative complications. The research underscores the importance of instrument selection and irrigation methods in optimizing dental surgical outcomes.",17,3.7,13.73,,,90,95,100,100,85,85,15,95,88,88,20,100

Access for this technique is provided by a preauricular approach and eyelid incisions with the addition of transcutaneous stab incisions overlying the arch. These stab incisions allow transcutaneous drilling and screw placement through a size CH 20 (5.0¬†mm) paediatric nasopharyngeal airway (NPA). We present a case series of seven patients. In all patients the arch component was successfully reduced and fixed, and no intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed. The use of an NPA is novel. It functions as a flexible self-irrigating sleeve and protects the skin from mechanical and thermal damage. The technique uses readily available equipment, is easy to learn, and simplifies surgery to the zygomatic arch.","Introduction
Up to 10% of complex zygomatic fractures involve the zygomatic arch with varying severity, and they can lead to restricted mouth opening and facial asymmetry. 1

During open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the zygomatic complex, arch fractures can be managed by observation, closed reduction, or ORIF, depending on their displacement and stability. When ORIF of the arch is required, a coronal flap is favoured as it provides excellent access for reduction and fixation. However, the coronal approach can pose significant risk, including temporary or permanent paralysis of the frontal branch of the facial nerve, paraesthesia or anaesthesia of the forehead and scalp, excessive blood loss, temporal hollowing, hair loss, and increased operative time. 1

To overcome these drawbacks some alternative approaches have been published as technical notes or case series. These procedures involve closed treatment guided by the intraoperative use of computed tomography (CT), image intensifier (C-arm fluoroscopy), or brain lab navigation, 234 or the modification of surgical approaches such as endoscopically-assisted reduction and transcutaneous screw fixation. 156789 These techniques have been used predominantly in isolated arch fractures and are dependent on specific instruments or equipment.

We have developed, as described below, the ‘Manchester’ method for fixation of the arch component of zygomatic complex fractures during primary or secondary correction. We present seven cases that utilised the technique.

Method
Between March 2022 and March 2024, patients who presented with zygomatic complex fractures with arch comminution and/or lateral displacement were treated by the ‘Manchester’ method at the time of primary or secondary surgery. Informed consent was obtained from all patients including consent for coronal access if required. Seven patients were included in the study with a maximum follow-up period of two years.

Technique
The surgical approach for the arch was similar in all cases.

Access to the zygomatic complex was obtained via upper blepharoplasty, lower eyelid (sub-tarsal) and upper vestibular approaches to expose fractures at the frontozygomatic (F-Z) suture, infraorbital rim, and buttress, respectively. Lateral subperiosteal dissection through the lower eyelid incision was performed to allow exposure of the zygomatic body and anterior zygomatic arch. A preauricular approach through an incision extending from the ear lobe to above the tragus was used to gain access to the root and posterior portion of the zygomatic arch ( Fig. 1 ). These two dissections were then communicated, meeting at the mid-zygomatic arch. This provided access to the entire zygomatic arch, which was viewed directly from either the anterior or posterior access incisions.

Following this, transcutaneous stab incisions were performed overlying the zygomatic arch fracture under direct vision ( Fig. 1 ). A mosquito artery forceps was used to deepen the wound by blunt dissection through to bone. A size CH 20 nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) was then placed through the preauricular incision. The non-flanged end was grasped by a clip and pulled through the transcutaneous stab incision so the flange of the NPA faced the fracture ( Fig. 2 ). The NPA was cut to the required length to accommodate the size of the shaft and cutting tip of the burr. Gentle traction on the NPA then increased visibility of the fracture site ( Fig. 2 ).

The fractures at the F-Z, buttress and infraorbital rim were reduced and fixed using a standard midface plating kit.

A long midface plate was then placed through the preauricular incision from the root of the arch to a stable area of the zygomatic body. It was then secured posteriorly and anteriorly through the access incisions with screws. Following this, the fractured arch fragments were reduced under direct vision with the aid of a Rowe zygomatic elevator. The fractured segment was then fixed to the plate after drilling holes through the NPA ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). Once fixation was completed the NPA was removed, and the wounds were thoroughly washed and closed. Patients were admitted overnight for eye observations. Postoperative imaging was performed in all cases to confirm adequate reduction ( Figs. 4 and 5 ).

A total of seven patients were treated (4 male and 3 female). The patients’ ages ranged from 23 to 56 years. The traumatic aetiology in two patients was a road traffic accident, three were caused by falls, one patient was assaulted, and one struck by a train. In all cases there were no surgical complications.

The stab incisions gave aesthetically acceptable scars. No plates were visible or palpable under the skin and no episodes of temporary or permanent facial nerve weakness were seen. No further procedures were required for any patients during the follow-up period, which ranged from three weeks to two years.

Discussion
The zygomatic arch provides the lateral facial contour, supports the masticatory load, and maintains space for coronoid activity. 10 Fractures of the arch occur either in isolation or as part of a zygomatic complex fracture, and they can have negative functional and aesthetic sequelae. Medially displaced fractures are usually amenable to closed reduction which, in these cases is effective due to stabilising factors including wedging of adjacent fracture sites, periosteal continuity, and muscular attachments. However, in laterally displaced or comminuted fractures these mechanisms fail, and in some cases this necessitates ORIF for optimum results. 111 The coronal approach has been favoured, as it provides excellent exposure allowing reduction and fixation under direct vision. However, in our opinion arch fixation is not routinely undertaken, partly due to the disadvantages of coronal flaps as previously highlighted. A retrospective analysis of the surgical management of 96 patients with zygomatic complex fractures showed that only four underwent four-point fixation. 4 We postulate that in certain cases, ORIF of the arch may be inappropriately avoided to avoid the morbidity of the coronal approach. This under-treatment may lead to the functional and aesthetic consequence of inadequately reduced and displaced zygomatic arch fractures.

Although minimal access techniques have been published, they are predominantly described for use in isolated zygomatic arch fractures. Gupta and Lehl, Chen et al, and Perry and Holmes have described exposure of the zygomatic arch by a preauricular incision. 5710 This involves either a temporal extension or a separate skin incision on the cheek over the arch to expose and fix the arch. 5710 Akdag et al and Xie et al described a combined transcutaneous and endoscopic approach in isolated arch fracture treatment. 16 Their techniques utilise small skin incisions for endoscopically-assisted exposure and reduction of the arch fracture followed by transcutaneous screw fixation. 16 Li et al used computer-assisted navigation to aid reduction, and Menon et al used an intraoperative mobile medical image intensifier (C-arm fluoroscopy) to confirm reduction at the arch after closed reduction techniques in isolated zygomatic arch fractures. 23 Giudice et al and Hayashi et al obtained reduction of isolated arch fractures by applying lateral traction with the use of transcutaneous wires or towel clips at the site of the fracture. 89 These techniques can, in specific cases, minimise morbidity of access to the zygomatic arch. However, in our experience they are not practised widely. This may be due to their technique sensitivity, steep learning curve, or the requirement for specialist equipment. We suggest that the ‘Manchester’ method has benefits over these described techniques. Specifically, it is effective in severe and complex injuries due to the excellent access afforded and the use of established incisions with low morbidity. Moreover, it uses readily available equipment and relies on direct vision familiar to all surgeons rather than more complex endoscopic, intraoperative imaging or navigational systems.

The ‘Manchester’ method is a reliable method for ORIF of the zygomatic arch in zygomatic complex fractures and allows the avoidance of a coronal approach. The technique utilises an NPA as a drill guide and retractor. The NPA also aids in the elevation of soft tissues to expose and fix fractures at the zygomatic arch along its whole length via minimal access incisions. Moreover, it offers protection while drilling and allows self-irrigation.

Conclusion
In summary, the ‘Manchester’ method is easy to learn, uses readily-available equipment and is acceptable to patients. Use of the technique can prevent the need for a coronal approach and its complications. We hope that it will encourage surgeons to fix the arch component of zygomatic complex fractures when indicated.

","This research project introduces the ‘Manchester’ method—a novel technique for managing the arch component of zygomatic complex fractures. Up to 10% of complex zygomatic fractures involve the zygomatic arch, which can lead to restricted mouth opening and facial asymmetry. Traditionally, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) via a coronal approach has been favored because it provides excellent access for reduction and fixation. However, the coronal flap is associated with risks such as temporary or permanent facial nerve paralysis, scalp paraesthesia, significant blood loss, temporal hollowing, hair loss, and prolonged operative time.

To overcome these drawbacks, alternative approaches have been reported, including image-guided closed reduction and endoscopically assisted techniques, yet these are often limited to isolated arch fractures and depend on specialized equipment. The ‘Manchester’ method was developed between March 2022 and March 2024 to address these limitations in cases of comminuted or laterally displaced arch fractures, whether during primary or secondary correction. The technique uses standard incisions—upper blepharoplasty, sub-tarsal lower eyelid, upper vestibular, and preauricular—to expose the zygomatic complex. A transcutaneous stab incision facilitates the insertion of a CH20 nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) that acts as a drill guide, retractor, and soft tissue elevator during fixation. A long midface plate is then secured to stabilize the reduced fractures.

Seven patients, aged 23 to 56 years and injured by varied trauma, were treated with this method. No complications, nerve injuries, or unsightly scars were observed, suggesting that the ‘Manchester’ method is an effective, accessible alternative that avoids the morbidity associated with the coronal approach.","This paper introduces the ""Manchester"" method for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of zygomatic arch fractures within zygomatic complex fractures.

Additionally, it presents a biomorphometric clinical algorithm to tailor treatment protocols for various types of bone loss.","Introduction
Bone reconstruction has undergone significant paradigm shifts since it was first introduced. To begin with, the gold standard for bony defect reconstruction was bone transfer 1 . Autologous bone was favored due to its biological properties and could be harvested from both intra-oral and extra-oral sources 2 . However, there are several drawbacks to using autologous bone. First, it requires an additional surgical site, which increases treatment morbidity, prolongs surgery time, and introduces the risk of additional surgical complications 3 . Moreover, it was found that autogenous bone grafts have a significant potential for resorption over time, jeopardizing the stability and health of dental implants placed in the augmented sites 4 . Additionally, the reservoir of autologous bone, particularly from intraoral sources, is limited. This restricts its use for augmenting small defects, while larger defects necessitate general anesthesia and a more extensive surgical approach, such as harvesting bone grafts from the iliac crest or the calvaria 5 .

Subsequently, with the advent of various bone products and membranes, there was a paradigm shift from bone transfer to bone regeneration 6 . The rationale behind this shift was that using bone products, whether of biological or synthetic origin, in block or granular forms, could reduce morbidity and complications associated with the donor site, and provide an unlimited supply of bone for augmenting defects of any size and configuration. The biological foundation of these procedures necessitates a blood supply and morphogenic cells, as well as the ability to maintain three-dimensional structural stability over time. Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) represents this paradigm shift 7 . Nevertheless, despite its popularity, it also has certain limitations and may be accompanied by potential complications. Initially, despite the vast reservoir of bone available for addressing large or complex defects, it is challenging to ensure equal and high-quality blood and cell supply to all areas of the defect, particularly for deeper regions 8 . Furthermore, the bone formed at the end of the regeneration process often contains reminiscent particles of bone substitutes, as well as fibrotic and granular tissue, and is significantly inferior in quality compared to natural bone, raising concerns about its long-term stability 9 . Moreover, in cases involving significant defects, such as segmental deficiencies, these techniques are ineffective due to the lack of a nearby source of morphogenic cells essential for bone formation 10 . Importantly, the use of this approach may require a significant amount of time for regenerating lamellar native-like bone. In fact, upon incorporation of bone substitutes solely to the defect site, the regeneration process can be lengthy, and in some cases may extend beyond a year 11 . Furthermore, since these techniques depend on the periosteum layer and the adjacent bone as sources of morphogenic cells, soft tissue exposure could eventually result in the failure of the regeneration process 12 .

Altogether, the limitations of each approach have led to a significant need for a new paradigm shift that may address the limitations abovementioned 13 . Here we propose that an alternative approach to the current focus on technical procedures seeking to enhance volumetric and three-dimensional bony reconstruction should be introduced. Recent advances in research have illuminated approaches whereby biological conditions can be controlled to an extent that will lead to regeneration of high-quality bone, ensuring excellent three-dimensional stability and long-term survival 14 . Consequently, surgical techniques that use exogenous cells, proteins and growth factors have been developed, resulting in enhanced biological and structural properties 15 . In addition, the advancement of tissue engineering methods to recombine cells and morphogenic growth factors and their clinical integration into various regeneration processes has led to the development of translational research that enables the generation of high-quality, predictable, and long-lasting three-dimensional stable bone in an expedited timeframe 16 .

The aim of this article is to present the scientific and clinical foundation for a new paradigm shift in bone reconstruction – the bone growing concept. Moving beyond bone transfer and bone regeneration, this new paradigm focuses on inducing bone growth using exogenous cells, proteins and growth factors in order to accelerate the reconstruction process and improve its outcomes. The article will outline the biological principles and clinical applications for bone growing and propose a clinical biomorphometric algorithm for bone growing.

The bone growing components
The bone growing process relies on three key components: an envelope, suitable bone products, and availability of cells and osteogenic proteins and growth factors ( Fig. 1 ).

This figure shows the three key components of the bone growing concept: an encasing envelope (biological or alloplastic), bone products and cells and growth factors. To expedite and improve the regenerative results, exogenous osteoconductive growth factors are incorporated.
The first key for long-term success of bone growing depends on establishing a good encasing envelope. Casap et al. 17 described a classification outlining the different bone reconstruction options suited to various defect types based on the availability and type of the envelope at the defect area. The envelope may be a biological or alloplastic.

The biological envelope may be comprised of a bony base and an encasing soft tissue (Type I), or of bone-only components (Type 2). The advantage of using a biological envelope is the endogenous supply of blood and cells.

In cases where there is a contained bony defect, or where there is a large contact area that can be covered with soft tissue in a way that allows long-term three-dimensional stability, a type I biological envelope should be the envelope of choice ( Fig. 2 ).

Fig. 2
Conditions that promote a predictable biological envelope encompass contained defects (one white arrow) and those with a large surface area (two white arrows). Notable, a concave facial bone (marked with orange dashed line) offers an excellent platform for a three-dimensional biological envelope, supported by strong foundational bone and a robust peripheral soft tissue envelope.
Conversely, in cases of bony defects with reduced contact area between the reconstructed bone and bone products, or when the predictability of achieving a long term three-dimensional stability of the soft tissue envelope is relatively low, the recommended biological envelope should be a Type II envelope, achieved through various osteoperiosteal flap techniques. ( Fig. 3 ).

The right blue box illustrates a streamline for donor isolation sites and osteochondral grafting.
In cases where three-dimensional stability cannot be achieved through type I or II envelopes, or in instances where there is a continuity bony defect, the construction of an alloplastic envelope (type III) is required. This provides three-dimensional stability over time. However, it lacks the ability to supply the regeneration area with blood and regenerative cells.

As noted, the second key for a successful bone growing process is the choice of suitable bone products. Various bone products may serve as fillers or scaffolds in different reconstructive procedures 18 . Despite differences in their sources or remodeling rates, most of these bone products only offer osteoconductive conditions and lack osteoinductive or osteogenic properties. This makes the contemporary bone regenerative process dependent entirely on the biological envelope’s ability to create the osteoinductive and osteogenic conditions necessary for replacing bone substitutes with native bone. Unfortunately, in many cases, the resulting bone is often biologically inferior, containing islands of bone substitutes and fibrous tissue.

The third key component of the bone growing process is the availability of cells and osteogenic proteins and growth factors. Although there is still no established method for exogenous implantation of osteoprogenitor cells, extensive research exists on the exogenous use of proteins and growth factors to significantly enhance bone regeneration 19 , including the use of recombinant bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) 20 and platelet derived growth factors (PDGF) 21 . BMP play a critical role in the bone growing process 22 . They induce and regulate osteoblastic differentiation through several key pathways, among which are BMP-Smad Pathway 23 , BMP-Runx2 Axis 24 and BMP-Wnt Interaction 25 . Promising preclinical data and encouraging clinical trial results have led to the FDA approval of recombinant human (rh) BMP-2 and BMP-7 for clinical use 26 .

The biomorphometric clinical algorithm for bone growing according to the bony defect type
Bony defects in the jaws can be classified in various ways, such as by the type of jaw involved (mandible versus maxilla) and the number of walls surrounding the defect (ranging from contained defects with four walls to defects with only one wall and no clear demarcation). For our proposed algorithm, we categorized the defects based on their directional outline into horizontal defects and vertical defects ( Fig. 5 ).

Horizontal bonny defects
Traditionally, horizontal defects are regarded as relatively technically simple and predictable to reconstruct surgically 27 . However, augmentations of horizontal defects can still fail if not performed according to correct biomorphometric principles 28 . The initial step in determining the appropriate surgical technique for augmenting horizontal defects involves assessing which components of the biological envelope are available for the regeneration process. If sufficient encasing soft tissue and adequate supporting pristine bone is present to form the three-dimensional tunneling outline necessary for the required orthoalveolar structure, GBR with type I envelope is the preferred surgical approach. In this context, the GBR principles summarized by the mnemonic PASS (Primary wound closure, Angiogenesis, Space maintenance, and Stability of the wound and graft material) should be followed.

In cases where there is insufficient soft tissue to provide an adequate biological envelope, but the existing bone structure is conducive to creating a type II envelope through a splitting technique, an osteoperiosteal flap can be employed. This procedure involves utilizing the periosteum and the underlying bone, using a crestal splitting technique, to form a well vascularized contained structure that provides the biological environment necessary for successful regeneration 29 .

In a previous report of an island flap in rabbit tibia, an osteoperiosteal flap where a segment of facial bone was detached from the tibia and repositioned facially while still connected to the periosteum, it was demonstrated that interpositional grafting received blood and cell supply from both sides 3031 . It showed that maintaining the periosteum's connection to the displaced bone creates a biological shell that effectively nourishes the inserted filler ( Fig. 6 ).

In a clinical report we demonstrated that maintaining the facial plate at a minimum thickness of 2 mm, with minimal reflection of the periosteum attached to the island flap, allows for significant and predictable horizontal ridge expansion with excellent dimensional stability over time 32 .

When existing tissues cannot provide an adequate biological envelope that meets the necessary requirements, it becomes essential to construct a type III alloplastic envelope, and incorporate osteogenic factors into the regeneration process 33 . While there are various methods and materials available for creating an alloplastic envelope - such as hand-crafted titanium mesh, reinforced membranes, and biodegradable polysaccharide shells—the most reliable and stable option remains 3D printed titanium shells 34 .

The use of rhBMP-2 on an absorbable collagen sponge (rhBMP-2/ACS) as an osteoinductive graft material in conjunction with demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) and titanium shells has been shown to promote bone growing in a shorter timeframe. In a previous article we showed that a mixture of BMP-2/ACS/allograft in a 50:50 ratio by volume demonstrated effective bone formation with excellent structural integrity and high biological volume and quality 15 .

Vertical bony defects
As noted, traditionally, vertical defects are regarded as challenging to replicate, both technically and in terms of long-term stability. This complexity is primarily due to the significant anticipated shrinkage of soft tissue and the consequent loss of bone volume 35 . Therefore, in these situations, relying solely on a type I biological envelope is not advisable, and type II envelope should be favored. Accordingly, the criterion for selecting the surgical technique for cases of vertical bone defects is based on the available vertical bone stock at the defect site, either in absolute terms or relative to a limiting anatomical structure, such as the floor of the nose or the inferior alveolar nerve.

When there is a minimum vertical bone stock of 5 mm, the recommended technique for bone augmentation is the Sandwich Osteotomy technique. This enables a minimum of 2 mm thickness for the translocated segment to prevent its resorption, together with at least 2 mm thickness of the remaining bone at the defect bed to maintain a safety margin to prevent injury to anatomical structures and enabling the securing of titanium plates and screws when needed to stabilize the flap 36 . In a trephine bone biopsy performed during implant installation, it was observed that high-quality bone was forming within the gap. This was attributed to the rich supply of blood and cells delivered to the interpositional filler from both the defect bed and the biological envelope ( Fig. 7 ).

In cases where the Sandwich Osteotomy exceeds 10 mm, and bone substitutes are used to fill the gap, approximately 10% bone resorption has been observed. Under such circumstances, it is recommended to use the BMP-2/ACS/allograft protocol 37 . Additionally, in specific cases where the bone stock is less than 5 mm above the inferior alveolar canal, and Smile Sandwich Osteotomy is still desired, it is feasible to perform a lateralization of the nerve prior to the Smile Sandwich Osteotomy. ( Fig. 8 ).

When the vertical bone stock is insufficient for an osteoperiosteal flap, the recommended surgical approach involves using titanium shells in combination with the BMP-2.

In a preclinical rabbit tibia study, dental implants were placed to extend 5 and 8 mm were encased in 3D-printed titanium shells containing a BMP-2/ACS. The study showed that the bone formed within the titanium shell matched the configuration and biological composition of the augmented adjacent natural bone, highlighting the reconstructive potential of this approach 38 . ( Fig. 9 ).

J Oral Maxillofac Surg 2015.
These preclinical observations were later translated to a clinical surgical procedure using the Titanium shell- BMP-2/ACS/allograft protocol 15 . The preparation of the BMP-2/ACS/allograft involves preparing the BMP-2 solution following the manufacturer's instructions, and a subsequent 20-minute protein binding period to the collagen sponge. After the BMP-2/ACS/allograft mixture is ready, the mixture is placed inside the shell prior to its placement in the alveolar ridge and fixation with titanium screws.

When a large sized titanium shell is utilized, soft tissue dehiscence may occur during the regeneration period, occasionally even in the early postoperative phase. However, studies have shown that the rhBMP-2 is gradually released from the collagen sponge over a period of 24 days 39 . Therefore, maintaining soft tissue coverage for this period and ensuring that the titanium shells are securely fixed, and patients adhere to good oral hygiene practices during the rest of the bone-growing process allows the BMP-2/ACS/allograft mixture to maintain its volume and stability. This approach results in successful regeneration and preservation of the intended bone volume. The success may also be attributed to the bactericidal properties of BMP-2 40 and the structural protection provided by the titanium shells. Upon completion of the regeneration process, the titanium shells are cut and removed, allowing the restored alveolar ridge to transition to soft tissue within two weeks ( Fig. 10 ).

Segmental defects
The reconstruction of segmental bone defects is traditionally performed through autogenous bone transfer 41 . This approach is favored for several reasons, including the challenge of establishing a blood and cell supply in the absence of bony support at the defect base and the necessity for immediate structural integrity of the restored bone. While some studies discuss using particulate autologous bone within alloplastic cages 42 , the majority of clinicians prefer utilizing an autologous bone block.

Over recent decades, a prevailing narrative has emerged in both the literature and clinical practice that bone defects up to 6 cm can be reconstructed using bone grafts, typically sourced from the iliac crest 43 . For defects exceeding 6 cm, reconstruction necessitates the use of free flaps, with the most common being from the fibula and iliac crest. Upon investigating the origin of this assumption, it becomes apparent that the initial basis for the 6 cm standard stems from an orthopedic article written by Weiland 44 , where he hypothesized that segmental defects greater than 6 cm would result in compromised blood supply for free graft reconstruction and recommended using free vascularized flaps for such cases. Nevertheless, this assumption was not supported by research data. Later, in an article by Allsopp BJ 45 , he noted that this assumption further biased subsequent studies regarding segmental defect reconstruction that cited this rule without really analyzing data regarding the relationship between the length of the graft and the need for vascular supply.

Indeed, other studies did evaluate the use of bone grafts for larger defects and have demonstrated excellent success rates, challenging the notion that free flaps are exclusively required for these cases 4647 . The recognition that free vascularized flaps are not mandatory for ensuring adequate blood supply to the reconstructed area, coupled with the use of alloplastic cages for providing stability and primary structural strength, forms the foundation for a new paradigm shift. This shift involves reconstructing segmental defects using bone substitutes, osteogenic growth factors, and alloplastic cages. The proposed protocol in the current algorithm includes utilizing patient-specific designed titanium cages combined with a BMP-2/ACS/allograft mixture. The treatment protocol involves planning the segmental resection and maintaining the space until the soft tissues in the oral cavity have recovered in full ( Fig. 11 ).

Following this healing period, a patient-specific titanium cage, composed of lingual and buccal parts, is designed. Using a cervical approach, the titanium cage is installed to maintain the three-dimensional structure of the reconstructed jaw, and the BMP-2/ACS/allograft mixture is placed inside the cage ( Fig. 12 ).

After 8 months, the resulting bone possesses dimensional strength and biological and morphometric characteristics comparable to native bone.

The quest for exogenous cell source for bone growing
Summarizing, the proposed algorithm provides essential components for bone regeneration including the utility of various envelopes, bone substitutes, and proteins, growth factors and cells. While the use of exogenous sources of osteogenic proteins and growth factors is tangible, the utility of exogenous cells is yet lacking. The advantage of incorporating cells with protein and growth factors, lies in their inherent capability to dynamically responds and drive biological process entailed in bone formation and turnover, such as vascularization, migration, mineralization and resorption. These processes are essential for generating a viable and durable bone. Importantly, the use of exogenous cell sources will enable accessibility and ease of use, as well as expediting the process of bone formation for long-term sustainability and tissue survival.

Stem cells are attractive cell sources given their self-renewal, proliferative capacity, and capability of lineage-specific differentiation under controlled culture conditions 4849 . While these capabilities are also relevant for induced Pluripotent Cells (iPCs) and Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs), their higher potency requires additional differentiation steps and even then, may elicit a host response. Given that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the mesenchymal source of osteoprogenitors, considerable research efforts and funds have been drawn toward the utility of stem cells and their controlled differentiation towards bone lineages. 50 Autologous MSC may derive from bone-marrow, dental pulp 51 , or adipose tissue 52 , and characterized sub-populations (i.e., expressing CD105, CD90 and CD73) are known to be permissive to osteogenic lineage acquisition in response to osteogenic factors as Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 53 .

Great body of work in the past years has focused on the possibility of driving mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation towards generation of osteogenic cells for bone repair 50 . Despite these efforts and the potential translatability of these cells for various clinical applications, several limitations prohibit their widespread utility. One limitation is the lack of critical mass of specific osteogenic MSC subpopulations 54 . To increase the critical mass of target populations, further passaging is often employed and consequently may harm pluripotency 55 . Osteogenic MSC populations quickly lose these properties upon culture propagation 56 hence less likely to differentiate after induction with osteogenic growth factors. These limitations contribute to the high cost and complexity of handling this cell source. Therefore, there is a critical unmet clinical need to develop alternative cell-based strategies and assess other cell sources for bone regeneration 57 .

Shifting the Stem Cell source paradigm towards Chondrocytes
The utility of nasal chondrocytes has been initially shown in an elegant study by Bardsley et al.,2017 58 wherein nasal chondrocytes were cultured on a polyglycolic acid scaffolds for 42 days and implanted in a rat cranial defect. Following this report, our group showed that WNT1 Inducible Signaling Pathway Protein 1 (WISP1), but not BMP2 may induce micromass chondrocyte mineralization in-vitro, and pretreatment with WISP1 slightly improved the structure of regenerate bone in a rat calvaria defect model 59 . In general, adding chondrocytes to collagen scaffolds or collagen scaffolds containing Demineralized Freeze-Dried Bone Allograft (DFDBA) expedited bone repair, particularly from the defect edges of the calvaria 5960 . These preclinical models support the utility of autologous cartilage and chondrocytes for bone regeneration purposes, prompting a potential paradigm shift in cell sources for this clinical need.

Chondrocytes from autologous cartilage can be easily propagated in tissue culture and are able to generate critical cell mass of homogeneous cells for future implantation. Morphogenic growth factors may induce mineralization of cartilage and promote the generation of a mineralized bone-like implant that can be easily remodeled. These processes are recapitulated in endochondral development and fracture healing of long bones and may thus be adopted for membranous cranial healing ( Fig. 4 ). Finally, as a donor site, cartilage shows the advantages of being both innervated and avascular, reducing the risk for donor site morbidity and pain. 32 Overall, preclinical data and in-vitro handling of cartilage and chondrocytes support their utility for bone regeneration. Several autologous sites may be considered, such as auricular cartilage or ribcage costal cartilage sites.

Discussion
Over the years, the field of bone reconstruction has experienced significant paradigm shifts. Each shift has propelled the field forward and prompted new questions that have guided further research and development. The initial paradigm of bone transfer enabled the reconstruction of sufficient bone stock, which allowed for the placement of “enough” dental implants to support prosthetic rehabilitation, even if the positioning was not ideal from a prosthetic point of view. While this was considered adequate at the time, increasing aesthetic and functional demands of both patients and physicians necessitated the development of a new approach focused on achieving better and more stable volumetric reconstruction over time.

The subsequent paradigm of bone regeneration effectively addressed the volumetric requirements, with techniques like GBR and others generally achieving a sufficient three-dimensional bone structure. However, two main issues have emerged over time. First, because the bone substitutes used in these techniques lack osteoinductive or osteogenic properties, the regeneration process can be prolonged, often taking many months. During this period, it is crucial to maintain the integrity of the soft tissue envelope and to facilitate transitional rehabilitation that do not exert pressure on the reconstructed area, which can be challenging to achieve. Secondly, the regenerated bone at the end of the process is sometimes significantly inferior to natural bone, jeopardizing the long-term stability of the reconstruction.

Cautiously, the paradigm of bone regeneration, exemplified by techniques like GBR, can be termed the “technical paradigm.” While it successfully achieves the target of a satisfactory three-dimensional bony structure from a technical perspective, it falls short of meeting all the biological requirements of natural bone.

In recent years, we have witnessed a new paradigm shift. In addition to the established mechanical and aesthetic requirements, there is now greater awareness of the need to produce high-quality biological bone that can be preserved over the long term. We propose naming the new paradigm the bone growing paradigm. This is because our goal is not only to introduce bone, either autologous or of other origin to the bony defect and allow the regeneration process to occur independently, but rather to use modern biological and technological methods to actively grow high-quality biological bone at the site of the deficiency.

Within this model, osteogenic and/or chondrogenic cell sources may be integrated with growth factors, to synergistically induce the bone-growing process. Regulating their presence in terms of quantity and quality enables us to actively manage the bone growing process and often accelerate and optimize it. Within this context, such cell sources are superior to MSC, given their lack of critical mass, handling complexity and related costs.

The initial approach to controlling cells and growth factors is both preservative and directive. Creating or selecting a suitable, three-dimensionally stable biological envelope allows for the most efficient use of the autologous cells and growth factors at the reconstructed site. Maintaining the integrity of the periosteum or carefully executing osteoperiosteal flaps both preserves the reservoir of cells and growth factors and optimally directs them to the reconstructed area and the bone substitutes installed in it. Nevertheless, when developing and maintaining a biological envelope that meets these requirements is not feasible, an additive approach is needed to precisely and effectively incorporate cells or growth factors essential for control of the bone growing process.

Since Urist discovered BMPs as bone-inducing proteins 61 much research has been dedicated to characterizing their application. More than 20 types of BMPs have been identified, but only some of them can induce de novo bone formation. BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP-7, and BMP-9 have been shown to act as key signals for the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells into osteoblasts, which subsequently form the bone extracellular matrix. Recombinant human BMPs, particularly BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-7, regenerate bone when paired with a suitable carrier in critical-sized bone defects 62 . One challenge with using rhBMP-2 lies in determining the precise administration dosage to match the defect's volume. If the dose is too low, the osteogenic response is inadequate, while excessively high doses have paradoxically resulted in osteolytic processes 63 . Another challenge is selecting the appropriate carrier for the rhBMP-2 when placing it at the restoration site. The carrier retains growth factors at the defect site, supports cell attachment, and aids extracellular matrix formation for tissue regeneration. It also should be biodegradable, induce optimal inflammatory responses, have adequate porosity for cell infiltration, prevent BMP degradation, and allow controlled BMP release 64 . Significantly, while the utility of BMPs may be appropriate for osteogenic lineage differentiation, it was not constructive in promoting chondrocyte mineralization 59 indicating that the type pf growth factor should also be considered when using different cells sources.

Collagen, the most abundant protein in mammalian connective tissue, is the primary non-mineral component of bone. It enhances cellular infiltration and wound healing and can be processed in aqueous form. Its biocompatibility, versatility, wettability, and ease of manipulation have enabled the development of collagen sponges as carriers for rhBMPs in tissue engineering, including for fractures and critical-sized bone defects 65 . While collagens are also well remodeled into bone, they lack the mechanical strength that can be provided by a shell or by gradual mineralization of encapsulated chondrocytes and/or osteocyte lineages.

In prior studies, we have demonstrated that a mixture of BMP-2/ACS/allograft in a 50:50 ratio by volume results in excellent structural outcomes, yielding high-quality bone and ensuring long-term stability.

The incorporation of allograft into the mixture creates a matrix that preserves the bone's three-dimensional structure and mechanical durability. However, despite the efficacy of this approach, a notable limitation of allograft is the lack of cells possessing osteogenic capability. Alongside methods to regulate growth factor levels in bone formation, current research is focused on controlling the levels and types of osteogenic cells involved in the process and coupling these approaches with suitable matrixes

The current advance in cell biology, brings for the opportunity of integrating cells from various tissues to promote this approach. In particular Stem cells have been discussed and widely researched, however here we propose a new source, Cartilage, built on research from our and other groups 585960 . Our preclinical models support the incorporation of chondrocytes in collagen and or DFDBA containing scaffolds, as they expedite bone formation to a significant degree in a critical calvaria defect model. Cumulatively, the addition of cells, growth factors and matrix at different stiffnesses may enable rapid bone regeneration and integration.

Conclusion
We are in a transformative era in jaw reconstruction, characterized by a shift towards biological and tissue engineering approaches. This paradigm change offers personalized solutions, integrating growth factors, scaffolds, and cellular therapies to redefine standards of care. As we advance in regenerative medicine, we embark on a journey towards a future where bone reconstruction realizes unprecedented possibilities in both form and function.

Conflict of Interest

None of the authors have a conflict of interests","The evolution of bone reconstruction has progressed from traditional autologous bone transfer to a novel “bone growing” paradigm that emphasizes biologically driven regeneration. Early techniques, reliant on harvesting the patient’s own bone, were effective but marred by donor site morbidity, prolonged surgeries, limited graft volumes, and unpredictable resorption rates. This led to the advent of bone regeneration strategies, notably Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR), which use bone substitutes and membranes to reconstruct three-dimensional structures. However, these methods often yield bone of inferior quality, marred by residual substitute particles and fibrotic tissue, and may require extended healing periods with variable vascular and cellular support.

The new bone growing paradigm addresses these limitations by integrating three key components: a stable encasing envelope (biological or alloplastic), appropriate bone substitutes, and a supply of osteogenic cells and growth factors, such as BMPs. Surgical techniques are tailored to defect types—horizontal, vertical, or segmental—with methods including osteoperiosteal flaps, Sandwich Osteotomy, and patient-specific titanium cages filled with a BMP-2/ACS/allograft mixture to enhance structural stability and expedite bone formation.

Additionally, while mesenchymal stem cells have been explored, their limitations in cell mass and handling have spurred interest in alternative sources like nasal chondrocytes. Preclinical studies indicate that chondrocytes, when incorporated into engineered scaffolds, can accelerate bone repair via endochondral ossification. Ultimately, this innovative approach paves the way for personalized, efficient, and durable solutions in craniofacial reconstructions.","This research paper proposes a shift in bone reconstruction from bone transfer and regeneration to a ""bone growing"" paradigm. Traditional methods like autologous bone grafts, while biologically sound, suffer from donor site morbidity and resorption. Bone regeneration using substitutes reduces morbidity but often yields inferior bone quality and lengthy healing times.

The ""bone growing"" concept focuses on actively inducing high-quality bone growth by controlling biological conditions. It emphasizes three key components: a stable envelope (biological or alloplastic), suitable bone products, and the availability of cells and osteogenic proteins/growth factors.

The paper advocates for the use of rhBMP-2/ACS/allograft mixtures to promote rapid bone formation. It also explores shifting the cell source paradigm toward Chondrocytes as stem cell sources suffer from limited osteogenic cells and quickly lose their ability to differentiate.

Traditional methods, such as autologous bone grafts and GBR, have limitations, including donor site morbidity, bone resorption, and lengthy regeneration times. The bone growing concept aims to overcome these challenges by using exogenous cells, proteins, and growth factors to accelerate and enhance bone regeneration, ensuring high-quality, stable bone formation.

The bone growing process relies on three key components: an encasing envelope (biological or alloplastic), suitable bone products, and osteogenic proteins and growth factors like BMP-2.

For horizontal defects, GBR or osteoperiosteal flaps are preferred, while vertical defects may require sandwich osteotomy or titanium shells with BMP-2. Segmental defects, traditionally treated with autologous bone grafts, can now be managed using patient-specific titanium cages combined with BMP-2 and allograft mixtures.

Oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) is a surgical specialty that deals with the diagnosis and management of diseases affecting the mouth, face, jaws, and neck. It is one of 10 surgical specialties in the United Kingdom, and the only one that requires registrants to be dually qualified in both medicine and dentistry. 1 Medical graduates undertaking the UK Foundation Programme complete two foundation years, consisting of six, four-month rotations in different specialties. Different posts offer different rotations, meaning medical graduates apply for posts based on their preferences. 2 Historically, applicants who were not allocated a post immediately were placed on the UK Foundation Programme Office (UKFPO) ‘reserve list’. The reserve list had grown significantly in recent years, rising from 45 applicants in 2016 to 791 in 2022. 3 Places were eventually found for all reserve list applicants. Since 2023, applicants are now assigned a post based on a unique computer-generated rank via the Preference Informed Allocation (PIA) system, 4 which has resulted in the reserve list now being retired.

The process differs slightly for dental graduates. They apply to complete one year of dental foundation training (DFT) in primary care. Following this, there is the option to apply for dental core training (DCT). This further training is often undertaken in secondary care in a particular dental-focused specialty such as OMFS or oral surgery. 5 Traditionally posts are for one year, and dentists may undertake up to three years of dental core training (DCT1, DCT2, then DCT3). Completion of DCT2 is usually a minimum requirement for dental specialty training.

Exposure to OMFS is therefore possible for single-qualification (SQ) holders through foundation year (FY) or DCT posts for medical and dental graduates, respectively. In England these posts are hosted by the UKFPO and Health Education England (HEE). The potential for the collaboration of FY doctors and DCTs within OMFS clinical teams provides a unique opportunity to capitalise on interprofessional education (IPE). IPE is a valuable tool for delivering optimised clinical outcomes in healthcare settings and enhancing the knowledge and skills of medical and dental trainees alike. 67 The literature also highlights the fact that IPE exposes trainees to different viewpoints and methodologies, which leads to increased knowledge retention. 8

There is an absence of literature comparing the ratio of opportunity in OMFS at the SQ level. Thus, the aim of this paper was to understand the composition of SQ OMFS posts across England by collecting data from foundation schools and analysing publicly available data from HEE and the UKFPO. This understanding will have implications for future workforce development and will help to identify clearer opportunities for specialty recruitment. We also hope to promote more widely an understanding of the interprofessional nature of our specialty’s workforce and thus the need for interprofessional collaboration.

Methods
Data on FY and DCT posts were collected and analysed separately, given the previously outlined structural differences in post allocation.

FY posts
In England 15 foundation schools are responsible for FY posts ( Table 1 ). 2

An open enquiry was made to each foundation school via email to collect basic data about the FY posts available. The following questions were asked:

1. Do you offer OMFS posts for foundation doctors?
2. If so, how many posts are available?
3. How many foundation doctors will have worked in OMFS across the 2023-24 period?
The scale of the UK Foundation Programme was then gauged using the most current publicly available UKFPO data. 4 This enabled OMFS exposure for FY doctors to be contextualised in relation to the total number of medical graduates. The exclusion criteria for data collected on FY posts are outlined in Table 2 .

Table 2
Exclusion criteria set by the authors and corresponding justifications for FY posts.
Exclusion criteria        Justification
Posts in Wales, Scotland and Ireland excluded (England only)        Foundation tear medicine posts vary across the UK including rotations, hours worked, and contracts. By restricting to England, we maintain uniformity in the junior doctor contract when comparing with DCT posts.
Core surgical training (CST) posts excluded        Dual qualification holders can apply for CST as part of their OMFS pathway, but very few CST posts have OMFS focus. We were focused on OMFS-only posts for SQ holders.
 View full size
Consequently, data on FY posts were collected for England only and excluded core surgical training (CST) posts. An exception was made with the UKFPO data, where the context of collected data was simply compared with the scale of the entire UK Foundation Programme.

DCT posts
The publicly available HEE dataset ‘2023 DCT post preferences and descriptions’ 9 was used to determine the number of OMFS posts for dental graduates. The dataset includes “oral surgery” as a ‘secondary exposure’ opportunity for DCTs working in OMFS on-call posts. When the search was restricted to an “OMFS” clinical focus only, posts with on-call OMFS requirements were inadvertently removed from the dataset. Therefore, “oral surgery” had to be included as an optional (+/-) secondary filter in addition to OMFS.

DCT posts that met the following criteria were analysed from the HEE dataset: those that were located in England, and those that specified a clinical focus of “OMFS” +/- “oral surgery”.

DCT data were collected in England only and were restricted to one-year posts. The exclusion criteria for DCT posts are outlined in Table 3 .

Table 3

Exclusion criteria        Justification
Posts in Wales, Scotland and Ireland excluded (England only).        Due to national variation in the junior doctor contract, only DCT posts in England were analysed to enable direct comparison with England’s FY posts.
Longitudinal DCT posts excluded.        These are DCT posts that are typically 2-year rotations. These posts can involve variable rotation between different specialties, therefore it would not be possible to quantify the degree of OMFS exposure within these posts.

Results
FY posts
Fourteen of England’s foundation schools responded to our enquiry (14/15; 93.3% response rate). A total of 25 OMFS FY posts were offered in England in 2023-24 ( Table 4 ). Each OMFS post was a four-month placement, supporting three doctors annually.

Based on the available information and assuming all known OMFS posts were filled, at least 75 FY doctors worked in OMFS in 2023-24. UKFPO data confirmed there were 9702 eligible applicants in 2023/2024, 4 giving perspective to the size of the programme.

DCT posts
A total of 530 DCT posts were available in England in 2023-24. 5 Over half (279) were one-year posts in OMFS distributed across DCT1, DCT2 and DCT3 posts ( Fig. 1 ).

Areas of underestimation
The reported numbers of FY and DCT OMFS posts are underestimated for the following reasons:

FY posts
Area of underestimation: no data from one foundation school.
Impact: the average foundation school hosts approximately two OMFS posts, suggesting a possible further six FY doctors.
DCT posts
Area of underestimation: exclusion of longitudinal posts.
Impact: 27 excluded longitudinal posts included OMFS as a clinical focus, increasing the potential for OMFS exposure, but by an unquantifiable amount.
To summarise the data and allow direct comparison, the ratio of posts and clinicians has been calculated in Table 5 .

Discussion
The data present increased opportunities for SQ OMFS exposure amongst dental graduates, with over 11 times as many OMFS posts for DCTs (279 vs 25), hosting 3.7 times as many clinicians (279 vs 75). Given that both the DCT and FY posts have been underestimated, we are confident that this reflects an accurate picture across England. These results therefore allow for the following points of discussion.

Workforce implications
In England, dual accreditation in medicine and dentistry is required to practice as an OMFS registrar or consultant. As per the “European Standards of Postgraduate Medical Specialist Training in October 2021”, 10 dual accreditation is beneficial to patients due to clinicians acquiring the necessary medical knowledge while developing improved surgical skills. Traditionally, most OMFS trainees obtain their dental degree first. 11 The demand for an additional medical degree has meant that 15 UK medical schools now offer accelerated graduate entry programmes for dentists as a ‘second degree route’. 12 Our data highlight the fact that with the increasing proportion of FY doctors providing valued membership of the clinical team, there may be an increased demand for second-degree entry into postgraduate dental training. Comparatively, only four UK dental schools currently offer accelerated graduate entry programmes for doctors as a ‘second degree route’. 13 We suggest that our specialty should approach this positively by working with local medical and dental schools to develop graduate entry programmes for both dentistry-first and medicine-first graduates.

To increase their awareness and potentially incentivise careers within OMFS, it can also be said that medical and dental trainees should be able to experience the specialty during their undergraduate training, before commencing their respective FY and DCT posts. However, a survey across two UK medical schools found that 61.1% of medical students had no exposure to OMFS, and 97% were unable to state any resources or organisations available to support them to pursue a career in OMFS. 14 Consistently, ‘insufficient exposure and awareness of the specialty’ is reported in the literature for medical students. 15 There is an acknowledgement that if OMFS was a ‘medicine-only’ specialty there would need to be a ‘significant increase in the exposure of [medical students and] foundation doctors to OMFS to create a group of young doctors who might apply to posts in the specialty’. 16 Perhaps this highlights an opportunity to integrate increased opportunities for OMFS exposure in the undergraduate curriculum for medical trainees, whilst continuing to provide opportunities for dental trainees.

Interprofessional education and collaboration
OMFS brings together a broad range of interprofessional staff, including DCTs and FY doctors, whose knowledge and expertise can be combined to deliver holistic patient care. 17 OMFS units have a unique opportunity to optimise the quality of trainee education and patient care through IPC to a greater extent than other medical specialties. Strong IPC has demonstrable benefits, including providing high-quality care for patients and attaining better clinical outcomes. 18 In addition, clinicians who have learned via an IPE setting have shown increased participation in teaching sessions and demonstrated higher knowledge recall. 6 In clinical teams with junior colleagues from mixed professional backgrounds, IPC facilitates shared learning, which promotes skill development. For example, shared learning can optimise a clinician’s understanding of appropriate referral pathways for patients. 1920 We also acknowledge that there could be dually qualified FYs and DCTs working within junior OMFS teams, which could further optimise IPC. The number of these clinicians is likely to be small, but this could serve as the basis for additional research.

UK Foundation Programme applicants on the rise
The number of eligible FY applicants is continually rising and, due to a shortage of available posts, a large number of candidates were previously placed on a ‘reserve list’. The number of applicants added to this list increased dramatically from 45 applicants in 2016 to 791 in 2022. 3 As of 2023, the post allocation system changed to preference informed allocation (PIA), in which eligible candidates were assigned a post based on a computer-generated rank. 4 The ‘reserve list’ was subsequently removed as all candidates were allocated a post, but some candidates were assigned ‘placeholder jobs’. 21 These are posts that have not been finalised, meaning doctors have, in some cases, been informed about their training location and rotations at short notice. There is potential scope and capacity to increase the number of OMFS posts for eligible FY applicants without detriment to the existing DCT workforce. This would simultaneously promote exposure to OMFS early in the career of medical graduates and address the growing number of FY doctors entering the UK Foundation Programme.

Limitations
We recognise some limitations in the paper. The data presented are a snapshot from 2023-24, and do not consider previous years or how the situation may evolve in the future. Although we can speculate on the trends and if they will continue, it may not accurately reflect the future. There is also clear under-reporting from both datasets, as highlighted in the ‘areas of underestimation’. However, with the current data, there would be insufficient margin to change the overall narrative shown.

Research direction
This paper provides a current snapshot of SQ OMFS posts in England with evidence that there are currently more OMFS posts for DCTs than FY doctors. These data identify the number of posts and theorise the potential impact this has on professionals in OMFS. There is further scope to investigate the specific composition of the workforce in different OMFS units and how this impacts patient care. In addition, further research could attempt to identify the effect of IPE specifically within OMFS units, and if the impact translates from other studies.

Conclusion
The number of SQ OMFS posts is significantly greater for DCTs than FY doctors. There is scope to increase the number of FY posts within the UK Foundation Programme without detriment to the existing DCT workforce. This could promote interprofessional working and development, increase awareness of the specialty among junior clinicians, and potentially alleviate the strain on the UKFPO due to increasing numbers of FY applicants. 34 The OMFS environment is a unique place for IPE and collaborative working, where separately qualified individuals can support one another and share their knowledge and skills, a necessity for the specialty. The national picture provides an initial insight into the OMFS workforce and paves the way for further research exploring the impact of this unique learning environment within individual departments.

OMFS is a unique specialty that requires dual qualification in medicine and dentistry, yet early exposure is possible through dedicated placements during the UK Foundation Programme for medical graduates and dental core training (DCT) for dental graduates. Historically, unmatched foundation doctors were placed on a reserve list until 2023 when a computer‐generated Preference Informed Allocation system replaced this method, ensuring all candidates receive a post. In contrast, dental graduates complete a year of dental foundation training before entering DCT posts in OMFS, which are typically one-year placements.

Data were gathered by emailing 15 English foundation schools and analyzing publicly available datasets from Health Education England and the UK Foundation Programme Office for the 2023–24 period. Fourteen schools responded, reporting a total of 25 OMFS foundation year (FY) posts, which would expose approximately 75 foundation doctors out of 9,702 eligible applicants. Meanwhile, analysis of DCT posts identified 279 one-year positions, indicating that dental graduates have over 11 times more OMFS opportunities than FY doctors, with a ratio of 1:3.72 in clinician exposure. The findings suggest that increasing FY posts could promote interprofessional education, improve specialty awareness among junior doctors, and help manage the growing number of applicants.

The major challenge has been to identify a degradable scaffold that remodels into TMJ disc-like tissue, and prevents increased joint pathology, among other significant complications. Tissue engineering research provides a foundation for promising approaches towards the creation of successful implants/scaffolds that aim to restore the disc. In light of improving the quality of life of patients who undergo TMJ disc removal, it is critical to establish a preclinical animal model to evaluate the properties of promising scaffolds implanted post-discectomy and to determine the most efficient implantation procedures to ensure a more reliable in-depth evaluation of the biomaterial replacing the articular disc. The present study evaluated the outcomes of two protocols for implantation of an acellular scaffold composed of an extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from the small intestinal submucosa (SIS) of the pig, as a regenerative template for the TMJ disc in a goat model. The outcomes suggest that leaving one-half of the disc medially will allow anchoring of the device to the medial aspect of the joint while avoiding lateral displacement of the ECM scaffold. The goat model is ideal to assess the longevity of tissue-engineered solutions for the TMJ disc, considering that goats chew for 12?16 hours a day. This study provides an important reference for the selection of a suitable scaffold implantation procedure and the goat model for the development of new strategies to assess TMJ disc regeneration.","Introduction
Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc removal, also known as discectomy, is a surgical procedure typically considered when conservative treatments have failed to alleviate symptoms associated with TMJ degenerative joint disease such as severe pain, limited jaw movement, clicking or popping noises, locking of the jaw, and difficulty chewing. The most common anatomical dysfunction of the TMJ is internal derangement of the disc; that is, the disc is anteriorly displaced and becomes morphologically damaged and/or perforated. Although there is not enough evidence of efficacy for the alleviation of pain, patients often opt for TMJ discectomy (disc removal) as a definitive treatment. 1

Unfortunately, when patients opt for surgical removal of the TMJ disc, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved allograft replacements, which results in direct bone-to-bone contact and subsequently leaves the joint susceptible to condylar remodelling and degeneration. 2 Even when utilising autografts such as dermis-fat grafts, these materials typically resorb within a year post-implantation, 345 which can lead to future osteoarthritis, donor site morbidity associated with tissue collection, eventual formation of scar tissue, and decreased range of motion of the mandible. Consequently, there is an imperative need to provide a permanent therapeutic solution to improve the quality of life of people who opt for disc removal.

An effective strategy for disc regeneration would represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of affected patients and prevent the inevitable consequence of degenerative damage to the articular surface and the downstream need for total joint replacement. While the TMJ Concepts (Stryker) and Zimmer Biomet systems offer a total joint replacement alternative for severe TMJ degeneration, 6 they require significant surgical intervention, are costly, and are not guaranteed to last more than 20 years. 7 Thus, the identification of an effective off-the-shelf replacement would represent a significant clinical advance. This could also benefit patients with congenital disorders (hemifacial microsomia and Nager syndrome) or others who suffer injury or trauma that requires effective replacement of a degenerative, non-repairable TMJ disc. 8 The TMJ disc is relatively avascular (like most cartilaginous tissues) and does not spontaneously regenerate or repair itself in vivo. 9 Therefore, creation of a tissue-engineered TMJ disc replacement that matches the native disc, and the ideal protocol for scaffold implantation constitute our major goals.

Previously, after implantation in canine and porcine models, we have demonstrated the rapid transformation of an acellular, xenogeneic extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold into tissue that exhibited similar properties to the native TMJ disc. 10111213 The canine model, while initially logical for disc replacement development (due to its hinge-socket TMJ preventing implant migration), lacks human-like anterior-posterior motions. 1112 Similarly, rapid growth of the zygomatic arch in pigs obstructs surgical access in adult animals, requiring studies in growing juveniles and limiting relevance to human anatomy. To address these issues, the goat model was introduced in this study. Goats provide human-like access and TMJ motions at skeletal maturity, and their extensive daily mastication (12–16 hours/day) makes them a valuable model for assessing the durability of a TMJ disc replacement for humans. 214 The present study aimed to use a goat model to evaluate the feasibility of two surgical approaches for the implantation of an acellular scaffold composed of an ECM derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS).

Material and methods
Animals
To address the purpose of the study, eight adult female goats (Capra Boer) were used with an approximate age of 3.5 years and a mean bodyweight of 40 kg. All animal experiments complied with the National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, under a protocol reviewed and approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

SIS scaffold manufacturing
SIS implants were manufactured as previously described. 10111213 Manufacturing and characterisation of the device was performed by Cook Biotech Inc at a laboratory that follows US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations.

Using standard operating procedures, total TMJ discs were removed from the goat under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation and in a lateral decubitus position. Animals were initially pair-housed before the study started and individually housed post-surgery. Before the day of surgery, goats were allowed to fast for 24 hours. On the day of surgery, they were sedated using a combination of ketamine (5 mg/kg) and xylazine (0.10 mg/kg) injected intravenously, followed by induction with propofol (4-6 mg/kg) before intubation. Next, isoflurane (2%-3%) was administered by inhalation throughout the entire surgery. Lidocaine (2%) was injected around the surgical opening. The surgical approach involved a horizontal incision (∼3 cm) just anterior to the tragus, with soft tissue dissection preserving the local innervation and vasculature (especially the facial nerve). The native disc was exposed and then completely excised ( [CR] ). Following discectomy, the SIS scaffold, which had previously been hydrated in sterile saline (0.9%) for approximately 10 minutes before implantation, was adapted in size to the joint space and positioned between the articular surface of the condyle and the temporal fossa. Two fixation sutures were placed laterally through the sheet portion of the SIS scaffold to anchor the device to the anterior and posterior aspects of the joint and to the surrounding soft tissues adjacent to the scaffold ( [CR] ).Then the muscle, fascia, and overlying skin were closed using resorbable sutures. After the surgery, signs of pain or distress were monitored through observations for depression or antisocial behaviour, decreased eating, and abnormal vocalisation. In addition, the goats were monitored for poor gait or lethargic behaviour. Animals were allowed to heal for 14 days post-implantation. Body weight was measured at the time of acceptance into the study, on the day of the surgery, and at one-week post-implantation.

The same surgical procedures were performed as described previously. However, in this second approach, one-half of the TMJ disc (lateral portion) was removed to anchor the device to the medial aspect of the joint. Three to four sutures were placed on the remaining disc, then on the sheet of the scaffold. Once the sutures were pulled and tied, the scaffold was pulled into place. Secure fixation was validated by trying to pull the scaffold laterally and out of the joint space. Images describing and illustrating the procedures are shown in Fig. 2 and [CR] . Animals were allowed to heal for 7, 14, or 21 days post-implantation after which the native tissue and the remodelled implant were harvested for further analysis.

Postoperative care
The animals were recovered from anaesthesia, extubated, and monitored until they were resting comfortably in a sternal position. Food and environmental enrichments were provided at the discretion of the Department of Laboratory Animal Resources (DLAR) veterinarian staff as needed. Animals were provided with a soft diet for the first seven days post-implantation and were returned to a normal laboratory diet afterwards.

Euthanasia
After 7, 14, or 21 days post-implantation, the animals were euthanised by intravenous administration of an approved euthanasia solution (sodium pentobarbital- based).

Histology
After death, the TMJ native disc/remodelled scaffold/ECM scaffold from each joint was harvested in its entirety, as well as the musculotendinous junction. With careful dissection, the articular surface was examined for continuity and integrity of the articular cartilage. One specimen within each TMJ time point (7, 14, or 21 days post-implantation) was utilised for histological analysis. Tissues were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 hours, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Each sample was sagittally sectioned at a thickness of 8 µm, stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and evaluated for ECM remodelling.

Statistical analysis
For body weight, values are expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD). Statistically significant differences were determined using the paired t-test over time to determine weight loss. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software).

Results
SIS implantation procedures
All surgeries were performed as previously planned in this study ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). After surgery, all animals recovered well without major complications. In some goats, swelling and hay compaction was seen during the first week, in which cases, painkillers were administered for seven days. Our results show that when the SIS scaffold was implanted in the joint space after complete removal of the TMJ disc, the ECM device shifted laterally, resulting in the device migrating out of the joint space in all the animals in which this procedure was performed (n = 5) ( [CR] ). As a result, after 14 days post-implantation the ECM device was not suitable for further histological analysis, since neither efficient positioning of the scaffold nor disc regeneration was achieved. Considering this first outcome, we used a second approach, where one-half of the TMJ disc (lateral portion) was removed to enable the device to be anchored to the medial aspect of the joint ( [CR] ).

Post-implantation clinical observations
Swelling of the face and mouth was noted in all animals in the study and varied from light to moderate. These observations are consistent with recovery from the procedure. Decreased activity and abnormal consistency of faeces were also noted, but were largely attributed to the surgical procedure and modified, soft diet.

Body weight and body weight loss
On average, animals’ mean body weights on the day of surgery were within a normal range for the species, sex, breed, and age (low: 37 kg – high: 46.5 kg). After one week post-implantation, the mean (SD) body weight loss was 0.99 ± 0.93 kg ( [CR] ). This could be attributable to the surgical procedure itself and the modified diet consumed during recovery.

Gross morphological and histological assessment
The removal of the total TMJ disc affected scaffold implantation and caused displacement of the device from the joint space, condylar erosion, and unsuitable regeneration of the articular disc ( Fig. 3 ). We therefore only analysed the integrity of the SIS scaffold in the goats in which the new anchoring method was performed (Approach 2). Gross morphology of the goat condyles showed formation of disc-like tissue ( Figs. 4 and 5 ). No new tissue formation was shown in unimplanted joints (images not shown). Next, we analysed the native disc (medial remaining portion), the interface between native disc-ECM and the ECM-only portion by histological assessment at 7, 14, and 21 days post-implantation (n = 1 goat per time point).

At seven days, the SIS scaffold was not remodelled and was not yet infiltrated with cells ( Fig. 6 , first row). At 14 days, mononuclear cell infiltration into the SIS scaffold was readily apparent. Interestingly, the remaining medial disc piece also seemed to be remodelling in the periphery, and the SIS scaffold was merging or incorporating with the remaining disc ( Fig. 6 , second row). At 21 days post-implantation, there was robust remodelling of the SIS scaffold, and the interface was hard to discern, indicating good integration of the SIS scaffold with the remaining disc ( Fig. 6 , third row). At these early time points it was not possible to perform mechanical testing.

Discussion
In the present study we have performed and compared two different approaches for the implantation of an ECM scaffold in the TMJ of a goat model to replace the TMJ disc. Scaffolds of ECM derived from porcine SIS were utilised as TMJ disc replacements following a full or half discectomy procedure, since they have proved to have promising characteristics as a constructive remodelling scaffold. 131516 In addition, this source was selected to maintain the xenogeneic nature of implants that are likely for translation to humans. The primary finding of this in vivo study was that only after removing one-half of the articular disc and securing the ECM device to the remaining medial portion of the disc in the goat could we avoid displacement of the device from the joint space that allowed for remodelling inside the joint. As early as 21 days post-implantation our results suggest robust remodelling of the SIS scaffold. Of note, placement of the device resulted in the formation not only of fibrocartilage within the bulk of the implant, but also site-appropriate muscular and ligamentous attachments resembling those found in native discs.

Considering that the ease of surgical access and the size of the goats are close to humans when compared with small animals, we introduced the goat model in our studies of TMJ tissue engineering following discectomy. 17 However, no definite conclusions can be drawn on the reproducibility of the results when using SIS scaffold to regenerate the TMJ disc due to the number of animals analysed using this model. Further studies are warranted to reveal the mechanical and biochemical properties of the tissue post-implantation at later time points.

To the best of our knowledge, our group is the first to develop a new caprine model and SIS scaffold-implantation procedure for the study of a xenogeneic material for TMJ disc regeneration. Since most FDA-approved ECM scaffold-based devices are porcine-based materials, it is logical to implant porcine-based ECM into another species, such as the goat. The model presented in this study seems simple, viable, and reproducible for the assessment of new treatment options, especially since the implanted material remains in situ.

In conclusion, we believe that this study provides an important reference for the selection of a suitable scaffold implantation procedure and the goat model for the development of new strategies to assess TMJ disc restoration.

Traditional discectomy, while relieving severe pain and dysfunction, leaves the joint vulnerable to bone-to-bone contact and subsequent degeneration due to the absence of FDA-approved allograft replacements and the transient nature of autografts. To overcome these limitations, the researchers investigated a tissue-engineered solution using an acellular xenogeneic extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS).

The study was conducted using a caprine model, chosen for its anatomical and functional similarities to the human TMJ, including comparable access and joint motions at skeletal maturity. Eight adult female goats underwent two different surgical approaches. In the first approach, complete removal of the TMJ disc led to lateral displacement of the scaffold and poor integration. In contrast, the second approach involved a partial (lateral) discectomy that preserved the medial disc, allowing the SIS scaffold to be anchored securely. This method prevented scaffold migration and promoted rapid cellular infiltration and remodeling. Histological analyses at 7, 14, and 21 days post-implantation revealed the transformation of the SIS scaffold into fibrocartilaginous tissue that closely resembled the native disc, with evidence of integration into surrounding tissues.

Overall, the findings suggest that partial discectomy with targeted scaffold anchoring is a promising strategy for TMJ disc regeneration. This approach could offer a durable, off-the-shelf therapeutic alternative to conventional treatments, although further studies are needed to fully assess the mechanical and biochemical properties of the regenerated tissue.","This study investigates the feasibility of using an acellular porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) scaffold to regenerate the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc in a goat model after discectomy, a procedure often performed when conservative treatments fail for TMJ degenerative joint disease. The rationale is that current surgical options lack ideal allograft replacements, leading to complications like condylar degeneration. The study compared two surgical approaches: complete disc removal followed by scaffold implantation, and partial disc removal with scaffold anchoring to the remaining tissue. The first approach resulted in scaffold displacement. The second approach, however, demonstrated promising scaffold integration and tissue remodelling resembling native disc tissue as early as 21 days post-implantation. The goat model was chosen due to its human-like TMJ motions and extensive mastication, making it suitable for durability assessment. The authors conclude that the partial discectomy approach in the goat model shows promise for evaluating TMJ disc regeneration strategies using xenogeneic ECM scaffolds. Further research is needed to assess the long-term mechanical and biochemical properties of the regenerated tissue.","This research paper investigates the use of a porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold as a potential replacement for the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc in goats, aiming to address the limitations of current treatments for TMJ degenerative joint disease.

The study evaluates two surgical approaches for implanting the SIS scaffold: complete disc removal (Approach 1) and partial disc removal with scaffold anchoring to the remaining disc (Approach 2).

The results showed that complete disc removal led to scaffold displacement and joint degeneration, while partial removal allowed successful scaffold integration and remodelling.

Robotic assistance may aid surgeons in operating in confined spaces with minimal access incisions by improving the degree of freedom of operative instrumentation.","Introduction
Paediatric craniofacial abnormalities affect the skull and facial bones in children. These conditions are predominantly congenital and can vary in severity from mild to profound craniofacial defects. The overall incidence is considered to be 0.2 to 0.5 per 1000 births[1]. The most common anomaly is cleft lip or palate (CLP). The overall incidence of CLP is approximately 1 in 600 to 800 live births[2]. Surgical interventions are crucial for craniofacial anomalies and pediatric head and neck conditions [2,3]. Other common paediatric craniofacial surgeries include management of craniofacial microsomia, microtia and craniosynostoses [3-5]. Common ENT procedures performed in the paediatric population include removal of nasal foreign bodies, drainage of neck abscess procedures, thyroglossal duct cyst excision, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy [6].
Surgical challenges in paediatric craniofacial and head and neck surgery include operating in a small cavity with limited depth perception, difficult angles, restricted access and poor visualization. There is a need for delicate tissue handling, muscle dissection and suturing at depth with simultaneous access using operative microscopes Emerging reports suggest that robotic assistance may r aid surgeons overcome t challenges faced by gaining optimal access, better ergonomics and more freedom with the use of operative instruments, thereby protecting surrounding structures and reducing patient morbidity.
Robotic Assistance in Paediatric Surgery
Previous work on Robotic Paediatric Surgery has demonstrated safety in the approach with low conversion to open surgery. This mode of surgery can allow procedures to be carried out in neonates weighing 2.2 kg[7]. The use of robotics in head and neck surgery has been reported in adult patients. Transoral robotic surgery is increasingly utilised for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal ablative cancer treatment,[8]. . The safety and feasibility of robotics in patients with head and neck cancer, parapharyngeal tumors, and skull base tumors requiring resection has been demonstrated in previous preclinical and clinical studies, as have the applications of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in supraglottic laryngectomy, radical tonsillectomy, and partial pharyngectomy procedures [9-13]. Whilst robotics has been used in neurosurgery for many years [14,15], there is little dedicated literature on the application of robotic assistance in craniofacial cases. This systematic review will investigate the use of robotic systems in Paediatric Craniofacial and Head and Neck Surgery.
Aims
This study will review the use of robotic systems in paediatric head and neck and craniofacial surgery. The total complications, length of surgery and surgeon experience will be evaluated.
Literature search
A literature search was conducted in June 2023 by two independent reviewers on Pubmed, Dynamed, DARE, EMBASE, Cochrane and British Medical Journal electronic databases for articles published between 1960-2024. The following search parameters were used to retrieve the relevant articles: “cleft lip”, “cleft palate”, “cleft”, “robotic surgery”, “orofacial defects”, “DaVinci” “robotic repair” “craniofacial” “congenital”, “orthognathic”, “oral and maxillofacial”, “head and neck”, “ear, nose and throat” and “cleft repair”. The search was updated in July 2024 to include the following search terms: “craniosynastosis”, “midfacial hypoplasia“, and ”frontofacial correction“.
Only original research studies published between 1960-2024 were considered. The following study types were reviewed: randomised control trials, prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, case studies and case series. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts for eligibility and inclusion. The same reviewers then screened relevant full papers before inclusion.
Inclusion
For this review, all studies focussing on the use of robotic systems to assist in paediatric craniofacial and head and neck surgery met the inclusion criteria.
Exclusion
Studies focused exclusively on robotic assistance on adult patients or those not involving craniofacial or head and neck surgery were excluded (>16 years old).
Data Extraction
The population studied were those patients undergoing head and neck surgery/craniofacial surgery including cleft/cancer/congenital malformations/craniosynostosis. The Intervention investigated was robotic surgery for craniofacial surgery/head and neck surgery. No compartor was used.
Outcomes: success rates, re-operation rates, complications, length of surgery, patient/relative satisfaction and surgeon experience.
Risk of bias and quality assessment
Each study was reviewed individually for risk of bias associated with the selection, comparability and outcome reporting using the Newcastle Ottawa Tool [16]. The results from the Newcastle Ottawa Tool were translated into the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) scores [17].
Complication rate
Complications from each study were recorded in Table 1. Those included papers with no complications mentioned were excluded from complication rate calculations, and Table 1 records these as “none mentioned”. Complications were totalled and divided across those papers which commented on complications, and excluded those which did not comment on any complications.Table 2.

Results
A literature search yielded 1,186 total results. 233 duplicates were removed. 629 were excluded from the title. 119 were excluded after screening the abstracts. A further 188 were excluded following a full-text review. Seventeen papers were included in the final review (Figure 1). Nine papers originated from the United States, three from Turkey, two from Italy, and three from India.

patients were included (male=29, female=32, unspecified=18) from seven case series [18,21,22,25,27,28,32], eight case studies [19,20,24,26,29-31,34] one case-control [23], and one cohort study [33]. All patients included were under 16 years of age (age range= 2 months—16 years). Indications for surgery are listed in Table 1.
Robotic Surgery procedures performed
Robotic surgery procedures performed are listed in Table 3. Robotic assistance was used to achieve visualisation (n=25) by either holding a camera or endoscope and holding a variety of different instruments needed to perform the required surgery (Table 4) [23,25-27,30-34]. Seven included papers did not specify which specific aspect of the surgery required robotic assistance or which instruments were held by the robot [19, 20, 21, 23, 25, 29 30]. Three papers commented on specific aspects of surgery conducted with robot-held instruments. Robotic assistance was also used to grasp the laser (n=2) in the repair of Type II laryngeal cleft; to denude the edges of the interarytenoid segment of the cleft (n=1), and to place sutures (n=2) [21]. Hot Shears and DeBakey forceps were used for tissue dissection, and the needle driver and fine tissue forceps were used for the suturing of muscles in the dissection and reconstruction of palatal muscles in ten consecutive cleft patients [23]. Robotic assistance was used (with the help of a drill guide), to progress a transfacial pin (2.0-mm Kwire) through bilateral zygomatic bones in midface distraction (n=12), frontofacial advancement (n=5), midface distraction and frontofacial advancement (n=1) [33] in 18 cases of robot-assisted LeFort level III midface distraction.

The Da Vinci robotic system was used for forty-eight included procedures. Seven included procedures were performed using the Da Vinci Si System, and three included procedures were performed with Da Vinci XI. The type of robot used was not mentioned in twenty-one cases.
Duration of Surgery
Eleven included studies commented on operating times [21-23,25,27-30,33,34], and six did not [19,20,24,26,29,32]. Operating times varied based on the type of procedure performed ranging from 10—320 minutes [21-23,25,27,28,30,32-34].
Success and complication rates
The average success rate for seventy-nine procedures performed was 93.7% (n=74). All included studies reported on success rate, and this was defined by successful completion of the robotic surgery operation with no further surgery or return to theatre. Mortality for all performed procedures included was zero. Four robotic surgery cases failed (5.1%) [18,21], and all four were due to limited robotic access, with one case requiring conversion to an open technique [21]. Only one case (1.3%) required further surgery at follow-up due to residual endolaryngeal neurofibroma within the vocal fold [30]. This case subsequently underwent laser microsurgery with no further complications. Two of the failed cases were attempted repair of laryngeal cleft, and one was an attempted posterior cricoid split with cartilage grafting (Table 1).
Thirteen studies reported on complications. A total complication rate of 16.0% was observed, and most of these complications were immediate with good resolution. Complications included; buccal laceration 8.3%% (n=1), prolonged anaesthetic time 8.3% (n=1), re-intubation 16.7% (n=2), minor bleeding 8.3% (n=1), silent aspiration 8.3% (n=1), accidental rupture of cyst with no complications 8.3% (n=1), partial dehiscence of mucosal wound closure with spontaneous resolution 8.3% (n=1). Of those patients who underwent procedures for craniofacial dystosis syndrome, two patients required revision surgeryfor an incomplete osteotomy due to inadequate movement during distraction 16.7% (n=2); one patient with severe airway issues required postoperative tracheostomy 8.3% (n=1); and one patient with severe globe subluxation required additional tarsorrhaphy 8.3% (n=1). Functional improvement at follow up was evident in all four cases [33].
Benefits to the surgeon
Only one included study commented on the benefits of transoral robotic-assisted surgery. Nadjmi et al [23] found that the use of robotic surgery in the repair of cleft patients in the paediatric population afforded the surgeons enhanced dexterity and precision, delicate soft tissue handling, excellent 3D depth perception, and relatively easy intraoral suturing.

Discussion
The overall success rate for included procedures within this review was 93.7%, with a complication rate of 16.0%. All complications were immediate with good resolution.
Success and complication rates
Whilst the complications reported in our included studies are minor with quick resolution in most cases and no long-lasting morbidity, complication rates are higher with endoscopic techniques [35] and open techniques (29% complication rate in open [37] vs 16.0% within this study) in common head and neck procedures. The most common complications seen with open techniques included seroma formation, surgical wound infection, haematoma and prominent scar formation. Cervical and laryngeal oedema has also been reported in some open approaches [36-40]. None of these complications were reported in this review.
Respiratory failure (range 0–28.6%), bleeding (range 0–4.4%), voice change (range 0–4.4%), and feeding problems (range 0–9.1%) have been reported following endoscopic transoral techniques [39,41,42]. The bleeding rate was higher within this review (8.3%) however not all papers commented on complications and the total number of complications was low (n=12). The rate of respiratory failure was less (16.7%) compared to previous literature, with only two patients requiring re-intubation post-surgery due to increased secretions. Voice change and feeding problems did not occur in any patients in this review at follow-up. Chen et al reported a 28.6% recurrence of lesions rate within their paediatric series [41]. In this review, there was no recurrence in all 79 included patients, with only one case (1.3%) requiring further surgery at follow-up (range 4 weeks to 3 years) due to residual endolaryngeal neurofibroma, rather than recurrence. Of the patients undergoing robot-assisted LeFort level III midface distraction, none had injury to the globe or tooth buds [33] and in all cases, the degree of airway obstruction significantly reduced and eye closure improved in all patients.
Benefits and drawbacks of robotic surgery
Several benefits of robotic surgical approaches to craniofacial, ENT or head and neck surgery have been reported including filtering of tremors [17,18,20,21], and improved ergonomics for the operation surgeon [43]. Paediatric head and neck surgery requires operating in a small cavity with limited depth perception and restricted access. With poor visualisation, operating microscopes often have to be used and the operations can be tedious. Multiarticulated endo-wrist movements of the robotic arms combined with higher magnification and three-dimensional depth perception allow for a more precise surgery with better visualization in otherwise inaccessible areas resulting in improved surgical outcomes [32] and improved depth perception [18]. Robotic-assisted surgery also allows for enhanced dexterity, delicate soft tissue handling, and relatively easy intraoral suturing [23]. Precision movement to avoid injury to local structures or indirect tissue injury is essential especially in paediatric cases. Indeed, our included studies do not report damage to local structures as a complication. These advantages allow for a reduction in the overall complication rates which indeed have been reported here. Not all included studies compared operating times between open and robotic-assisted surgery cases, but the one that did report that robotic-assisted surgery operating time was longer [23]. However, the duration of robotic-assisted surgery is known to be significantly shorter with increasing experience [21], and so the expertise of the operating surgeon can affect surgery times. The steep learning curve in robotic surgery can be addressed via simulated surgical settings and improved training in the current surgical workforce in robotic-assisted surgery techniques, alongside increased research in the area and improved reporting within the literature. Nonetheless, the duration of hospitalization was shorter in robotic-assisted surgery compared to other techniques [19,23] in included patients. This is likely due to the reduced rate of complications which we also report.
Applications of robotic surgery in craniofacial surgery
The implementation of robotics in paediatric craniofacial surgery has shown promise in improving safety in complex procedures which are otherwise delayed until later life. For example, midface surgery in the first two years of life has a high failure and is technically difficult due to lower ossification of the facial bones [44,45] and as such these operations are often postponed until after 5 years of age [45]. Long-term follow up however has demonstrated improvement in intracranial pressure and consequently cognitive function in paediatric patients with midface hypoplasia and faciocraniosynostosis [47,48]. The use of robotic assistance could facilitate the use of techniques otherwise avoided till a later age, and allow for faster operating times and preservation of surrounding tissues. The transfacial pin technique allows for reduced blood loss and elinates the risk of communication between nasal and paranasal compartments within the intracranial space, but has not been widely used in young patients due to high morbidity from iatrogenic injury to orbital and tooth buds [48,49]. Indeed, using transfacial pins for midface distraction in very young patients with midface retrusion and distortion is challenging with a high morbidity rate due to iatrogenic orbital and tooth bud injury, and sees high failure rates, due to their deformed skull and hypoplastic midface [50,51]. Our included paper, the only paper in the literature at present on the topic,demonstrates no orbital and tooth bud injury using robotic-assisted transfacial pin. The age profile of included patients undergoing midface retraction is also lower than elsewhere [52-55] in this included study. Compared with traditional osteotomy techniques, the technique of using transfacial pins allows for midface distraction to be addressed early [48] and could prevent iatrogenic injury if passed with robotic assistance. However this paper included only eighteen patients, and so the published research on this topic remains limited. Further research within the area is required to draw well-informed conclusions on the true safety and application of robotic assistance in craniofacial surgery, but the available literature does show promise.
Limitations
All studies included within this review often focused on different aims with no universal definition of surgical failure making comparison difficult. The quality of the papers included in this review and the significant heterogeneity between the papers were major limitations. A range of surgical procedures considered made it difficult to compare operative times and length of hospital stay. The heterogeneity and different comparators used did not allow for a meta-analysis to be performed. The limited availability of published research within the area makes it difficult to draw convincing conclusions, especially in the case of craniofacial surgery where there was only one paper suitable for inclusion. There is also likely to be an inherent selection bias in patients selected for minimally invasive surgery using robot-assisted systems which should be considered when comparing complication rates.
Conclusion
Robotic-assisted surgery demonstrates a low complication rate in our included studies in treating a range of different pathologies in the head and neck. Robotic-assistance in craniofacial surgery demonstrates promise in preventing iatrogenic injury from more traditional methods, and could allow for operations to proceed earlier in life in the management of midface distraction Whilst the literature is more established in the applications of robotics in head and neck surgery, we demonstrate that more research is required in the applications of robotic-assistance in craniofacial surgery. Whilst the method demonstrates promise, we are still far from drawing well-informed conclusions but the field does demonstrate promise which should be considered. Our findings demonstrate the critical need for further research into the applications of robotic assistance in OMFS. Investigating the implications for clinical safety, efficacy, and long-term outcomes will be essential for defining the role of robotics in maxillofacial surgery.

Craniofacial abnormalities, predominantly congenital in nature, include conditions such as cleft lip and palate, craniosynostosis, and other complex craniofacial malformations. Traditional surgical approaches in these cases are challenging due to limited operating space, poor depth perception, and restricted access. Robotic assistance, offering enhanced 3D visualization, improved dexterity, and tremor filtering, has been posited to overcome these challenges and potentially reduce patient morbidity.

A comprehensive literature search was performed across multiple databases (PubMed, Dynamed, EMBASE, Cochrane, among others) for studies published between 1960 and 2024. Seventeen studies meeting strict inclusion criteria—focusing on paediatric patients (<16 years) and robotic intervention in craniofacial or head and neck surgery—were selected. The studies comprised various designs, including case series, case studies, one case-control, and one cohort study, encompassing 79 procedures across diverse indications such as cleft repairs, tumour resections, and midface distraction.

The findings reveal an overall success rate of 93.7% and a complication rate of 16.0%, with most complications being minor and resolving promptly. The Da Vinci robotic system was predominantly used. Despite longer operating times initially, the robotic approach may reduce hospital stays and the risk of iatrogenic injury, while providing surgeons with improved ergonomics and precision. However, the review also notes limitations including heterogeneity among studies, variable quality ratings, and a steep learning curve. Ultimately, while robotic-assisted surgery shows promise in enhancing paediatric craniofacial interventions, further high-quality research is required to fully establish its clinical benefits and long-term outcomes.","This systematic review investigates the use of robotic systems in pediatric craniofacial and head & neck surgery, aiming to evaluate complications, surgical duration, and surgeon experience. A comprehensive literature search identified 17 relevant studies published between 1960 and 2024. The review encompassed various procedures, including cyst excisions, cleft repairs, midface distraction, and tumor resections, performed on children aged 2 months to 16 years. The Da Vinci system was predominantly used.

Results indicated a 93.7% success rate with a 16% complication rate, predominantly immediate and resolvable. Benefits include enhanced dexterity, precision, and 3D depth perception for surgeons, potentially improving outcomes in difficult-to-access areas. Operating times varied, and one study indicated that robotic surgery took longer but shortened hospitalization compared to other techniques. One study suggested that robotic assistance in craniofacial surgery shows promise in preventing iatrogenic injury from more traditional methods, and could allow for operations to proceed earlier in life in the management of midface distraction The authors highlight the need for further research to establish the safety, efficacy, and long-term outcomes of robotics in maxillofacial surgery, acknowledging limitations due to study heterogeneity and limited literature, especially in craniofacial applications.","This systematic review evaluates the use of robotic systems in paediatric craniofacial and head and neck surgery, focusing on success rates, complications, and surgical outcomes. The study analysed 17 papers, including case series, case studies, and cohort studies, involving 79 paediatric patients under 16 years old. The Da Vinci robotic system was predominantly used for procedures such as cyst excision, laryngeal cleft repair, and midface distraction. The overall success rate was 93.7%, with a complication rate of 16.0%, primarily minor and resolving quickly. Common complications included buccal laceration, prolonged anaesthetic time, and re-intubation. Robotic assistance offered benefits such as enhanced precision, improved depth perception, and reduced tissue injury, particularly in complex procedures like midface distraction, where it minimized risks to orbital and tooth bud structures. However, the literature on robotic applications in craniofacial surgery remains limited, with only one study addressing midface distraction. The review highlights the potential of robotic systems to improve surgical outcomes and reduce complications in paediatric head and neck surgery but underscores the need for further research, particularly in craniofacial procedures, to establish definitive conclusions and optimize robotic techniques.",9,3.8,15.23,,,95,95,10,95,84,85,15,90,88,90,10,95

In terms of the V2 trigeminal neuralgia, the most difficult procedure in nerve block is accurate and fast greater palatine foramen (GPF) insertion. In this study, we developed a new technique using a personalised digital tooth-supported guide plate to increase insertion accuracy and success rates and reduce the pain of patients during injection. A total of 18 patients with TN (11 female and 7 male) were enrolled and treated between September 2020 and June 2022. Before injection, the guide plate was designed via Mimics three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technology and printed via 3D printer. Then, all patients underwent maxillary nerve block with a guide plate for each injection. In this study, placement of all guide plates was completed within one minute and all punctures were successful the first time. The depth of the injection needle was over 2.5¬†cm in all cases and the guide plate was stability-supported by the maxillary teeth. The various pain scores had an obvious improvement. No patients presented symptoms of local anaesthetic toxicity or onset of new neurological sequelae. Using this new technology, we can significantly reduce the difficulty of GPF insertion and decrease patient pain during injection. The enhanced success rate of nerve block can achieve better therapeutic effect. For surgeons, personalised digital tooth-supported guide plates make the operation easier, especially for novice surgeons.","Introduction
Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is one of the most common neuropathic disorders that occurs most frequently in people over 50.1–3 The characteristic of pain in trigeminal neuralgia is electric shock-like, burning, or stabbing and is located in the innervated region of the trigeminal nerve.1,4 During TN attacks, patients find the pain extremely intolerable and intense, often making them feel severely depressed and anxious, which seriously affects their quality of life.3,5
The aetiology and the mechanism of TN are complicated. Accordingly, an effective treatment remains a challenge.3 The treatment methods of trigeminal neuralgia mainly include drugs and surgery.6 The first-line drug to treat trigeminal neuralgia is carbamazepine.3,7,8 However, carbamazepine has poorly responsive for some stubborn TN patients, and its long-term use may exerts adverse events such as somnolence, dizziness, and liver dysfunction.3,7,9 The surgical methods mainly include microvascular decompression (MVD), gamma knife radiosurgery, percutaneous radiofrequency, percutaneous rhizotomy, and trigeminal ganglion percutaneous balloon compression (BC).10–12 Although surgical treatments may exert a better therapeutic effect, all of these percutaneous methods have the propensity to cause lesions in the trigeminal nerves or trigeminal ganglia, and these consequences appear to be directly proportional to the severity of the post-treatment sensory impairment.13,14 Nerve blocksing uses local anaesthetics to block the pain-producing processes via nerve axons for a long time, which is wildly employed.15,16 Nerve block therapy for TN can relieve the pain immediately and the effect of regular treatment can last for a period of time.17 More importantly, nerve blocking is almost non-invasive, has no age limit for patients, no complications, and no strict contraindications. The mixture of carbamazepine and local anaesthetics for nerve block exerts a synergistic effect to achieve a better therapeutic effect.18,19
The trigeminal nerve has three major branches (V1: the ophthalmic division; V2: the maxillary division and V3: the mandibular division), which affects the region of pain independently or mutually.1 Case V2 is the most prevalent.5,20 The V2 nerve can be accessed through the greater palatine foramen (GPF) in the hard palate of the oral cavity.21 Therefore, the greater palatine foramen is the intraoral marker point for maxillary nerve block anaesthesia.21,22 However, the GPF is covered by the palatal mucosa which results in difficulty in locating the GPF.23 Meanwhile, the position of the GPF and the anatomy of the greater palatine canal (GPC) have the possibility of variation, which also leads to repeated insertion or insertion failure, thereby increasing the discomfort of the patient and failure rate of the nerve block.24 To further solve this difficulty, computed tomography (CT) is often used to obtain high-quality anatomical data. However, during injection, real-time CT guidance for nerve block seems impossible. With the advanced development of 3D reconstruction technology and 3D print techniques, we have designed a guide plate to reveal the location of the GPF clearly and guide the injection needle into it accurately. The digital plate-guided nerve block can enhance the success rate, reduce the injection time to relieve the pain of patient, and achieve a better therapeutic effect.

The design and preparation for the digital injection guide plate
The maxilla was scanned with a medium-field-of-view CT (0.265 mm slice intervals) and the date was saved using the DICOM 3.0 format. Using Mimics 17.0 software (Materialise) and automatic segmentation techniques, the CT data were transformed into 3D reconstructions. The Mimics 17.0 software can be used to obtain the required data to create a 3D representation of the desired bony tissue. Then, the intraoral laser scanners scanned the maxillary dentition of the patient to obtain accurate 3D surface data. Finally, the 3D CT reconstruction data were matched with the 3D data obtained from the maxillary dentition and the exact 1:1 model of the maxilla was fabricated via 3D printer (Stratasys Eden350v 3D printer). According to the 3D CT reconstruction data, we confirmed the location of the GPF and the angle and direction of the GPC, and further determined the proper size and position of the holes of the guide plate. The maxillary teeth were chosen as the retention surface. Based on the above design, the injection guide plate was 3D printed and placed into the model of the maxilla to ensure its stability and position.
The procedure for plate-guided maxillary nerve block through the mouth
The guide plate was disinfected with iodoform and placed on the maxillary teeth of the patient. We inserted the 30-gauge needle into the injection hole of the guide plate, following the injection canal. After aspiration without blood, we slowly injected the mixture of lidocaine and mecobalamin into the greater palatine canal to block the nerve. All participants had the nerve block every other week and in total received seven treatments.
Evaluation indexes for digital guide plate-guided maxillary nerve block
In this study, we compared six different time points for each participant: before the first injection (T0), thirty minutes after the first injection (T1), before the third injection (T2), before the fifth injection (T3), before the seventh injection (T4), and two months after the last injection (T5). We recorded the trigger point, the longest pain duration, and the highest frequency of pain attacks. Participants were categorised into five grades based on their pain duration (PD): grade 0 (painless), grade 1 (0< PD ≤20 s), grade 2 (20 s< PD ≤60 s), grade 3 (60 s< PD ≤120 s), grade 4 (120 s< PD ≤300 s), and grade 5 (PD >300 s). The attack frequency (AF) was also classified into five grades: grade 0 (AF =0), grade 1 (1< AF ≤5), grade 2 (5< AF ≤10), grade 3 (10< AF ≤20), and grade 4 (AF >20). We also evaluated the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain intensity score, and the visual analogue scale (VAS) score.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed via SPSS 23.0 software. We compared PD, AF, and BNI pain intensity using the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test. The VAS scores were assessed with paired sample t tests. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Following an assessment of their medical histories, a total of 18 patients with TN (11 female and 7 male) were enrolled and treated between September 2020 and June 2022. The characteristics of the patients based on the inclusion criteria are presented in Table 1.

The digital guide plate was 3D printed, and the diameter of the anchor pin was 1.5 mm, which was suitable for the injection needle to make sure the great stability of needle with no movement. The average length of the anchor pin was 3 mm to ensure enough length to guide the needle's angle and direction to insert GPC precisely. In this study, we recorded the time of placement of the guide plate, which was inserted in the maxillary teeth within 60 seconds for each injection of each patient. With the help of the guide plate, successful injections into the GFC were achieved at the first attempt for all 17 participants and the depth of injection needle was all over 2.5 cm, indicating that the needle was inserted into the GFC completely.
The continuous changes of the trigger point, PD, AF per day, and BNI pain intensity score throughout the course of the timepoints are shown in Table 2. After a period of nerve block treatment, only one patient found that it was not completely effective, but the pain was tolerable and had little impact on daily life with no evident trigger point. The trigeminal nerve pain of the other 17 patients was perceptibly relieved after the nerve block. The trigger points disappeared. The attack time, the frequency of pain, and BNI pain intensity score had significant improvements. We also compared VAS scores (Table 3). The mean (SD) VAS score of patients before therapy was 8.00 (0.91) points. The VAS score decreased evidently after 30 minutes of injection, which suggests that the nerve block generated an immediate effect. The mean (SD) score measured two months after the procedure was 1.24 (0.63), indicating an effective and long-lasting therapeutic effect.

Case study
A 57-year-old male had been diagnosed with left TN(V2) for two years. He received carbamazepine drug therapy for six months, but there was no significant improvement even at the highest dose. Hence, we performed a maxillary nerve block to further relieve the pain. At the first injection, we located the position of the GPF at the distal palatine of the second molar and inserted the injection needle after several angle adjustments. However, the needle could not be inserted deeply enough to completely enter into the GPC, and the patient also had an unsatisfactory response to the first nerve block treatment. Hence, we performed a maxillofacial CT scan and obtained relevant data concerning the GPF and GPC. We observed that alongside the regular anatomical position of the GPF, there existed a variable tubular structure with no nerves and blood vessels in the sagittal section. The correct position of the GPC is located in the proximity of the second molar, anterior to the conventional anatomical position. The abnormal position of this GPF therefore resulted in the failure of the nerve block therapy (Fig. 1).

Basing on the CT data, we designed the tooth-supported guide plate and further adjusted and confirmed optimal insertion site and angle in the plate. We printed the 3D guide plate with the site of injection marked on it with an additional anchor pin (Fig. 2). The patient lay in the dental chair, and the angle between the maxillary plane and the ground was about 45°∼ 60°. We inserted the injection needle into the GPF through the designed anchor point and pushed the needle through the cannula. With the help of the guide plate, the needle was inserted into the actual GPC successfully with one attempt and the insertion depth was over 2.5 cm. In the following therapy, all nerve blocks were achieved the first time (Fig. 3).

Discussion
The trigeminal nerve block is recognised as a useful treatment for TN. It has the advantages of reversibility, minimal trauma, long-lasting therapeutic effect, and has almost no complications. The key to the long duration of pain mitigation after the local anaesthetic dissipated is ‘breaking the pain cycle’ by rapid blockade of sensory afferents of Na+ channels.25 The injected drugs include lidocaine and carbamazepine. The lidocaine attenuates the nociceptive transmission within the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and cervical dorsal horn to interrupt the pain cycle and carbamazepine suppresses the hyperexcitability and ectopic firing of the Gasserian ganglion and dorsal root.18,26 Consequently, it is possible to speculate that the mechanism of drug action operated in conjunction.
There are two intraoral approaches to blocking the maxillary nerve: high tuberosity approach and GPC approach. In our previous study, we attempted the high tuberosity approach for TN therapy.22 However, the high tuberosity approach lacks profound anaesthesia due to the wide space and has a high relative risk of haematoma due to the adjacent pterygoid venous plexus, which resulted in an unstable therapeutic effect and associated complications. In the GPC approach, the needle inserts into the GPF and advances finally reaching the inferior part of the PPF, which has a higher success rate for maxillary nerve block with minimal risk. The difficulty of performing greater palatine block of the trigeminal nerve (which is the most effective) is confirming the position of the GPF and adjusting the inserted angle of GPC, especially for novice surgeons.
The development of digital medicine provides us with new ideas and methods to solve such problems. However, a guide plate for nerve block has not yet been perfected. We used the 3D reconstruction technique and 3D printing technology to design a personalised tooth-supported digital guide plate. The position of the teeth is relatively constant, which can provide retention for the guide plate and enhance stability of the guide plate. By managing and analysing CT data, this guide plate offers a uniquely precise position and direction of insertion to reduce the injection time and frequency of insertion and guarantee the needle insertion into a sufficient depth of GPC. The guide plate can avoid subjective influence of the operator to reduce the times of repeated insertion. The guide plate is reusable, and a problem or defect concerning a single tooth will not influence the stability of the whole guide plate. More importantly, mainly aiming at the maxillary nerve block via GPC approach, this guide plate can also apply to a variety of surgical procedures in this region or nasal surgical repair to reduce bleeding.
This study concentrating on the use of new technology, still has some drawbacks, including a small sample size, the absence of a control group, and a short period of extra follow up. A future study must address these issues in order to produce more accurate and reliable conclusions and data. One problem is that the placement or support of the guide plate may be made more challenging by compromised conditions such as tooth loss, dentition defects, or insufficient dental treatment, particularly in edentulous jaws. In a subsequent study, we will identify a more stable guide plate supported by soft tissue or other fixation methods to solve the above issue.
Conclusion
The maxillary nerve block via the greater palatine foramen is a simple, safe, and effective treatment for medication-refractory V2 TN. To locate the GPF and adjust the angle and direction of injection, we designed a tooth-supported digital guide plate. Using this new technology, we can significantly reduce the difficulty of GPF insertion and decrease patient pain during injection. The enhanced success rate of nerve block can achieve better therapeutic effect. For surgeons, personalised digital tooth-supported guide plates make the operation easier, especially for novice surgeons.

Data availability

Treatments include carbamazepine and various surgical interventions; however, these can be limited by inadequate pain relief, adverse effects, or complications such as nerve damage. This study focuses on a minimally invasive nerve block technique targeting the V2 branch via the greater palatine foramen (GPF), which can be challenging to locate due to mucosal coverage and anatomical variability.

Utilizing high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and intraoral laser scanning, the researchers reconstructed 3D models of the maxilla and dentition, which were then fused to design a personalized, tooth-supported digital guide plate. This guide plate was 3D printed and used to precisely direct a 30-gauge injection needle through the GPF into the greater palatine canal (GPC) for administering a mixture of lidocaine and mecobalamin, thereby achieving an effective nerve block. Eighteen patients with refractory V2 TN underwent this procedure, receiving seven treatments over several weeks. Outcome measures—including trigger points, pain duration, attack frequency, Barrow Neurological Institute pain scores, and visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings—demonstrated significant improvements, with immediate and sustained pain relief observed.

The study concludes that the digital guide plate enables accurate, efficient, and safe maxillary nerve block, offering an effective therapeutic option for TN patients while simplifying the procedure for clinicians. Limitations include a small sample size, lack of a control group, and short follow-up duration, suggesting that future research with larger cohorts and extended monitoring is necessary to further validate these findings.","This research paper investigates a new approach to maxillary nerve blocks for treating trigeminal neuralgia (TN) affecting the V2 branch. TN, characterized by intense facial pain, is often treated with medication like carbamazepine, which can have limited effectiveness and side effects.

For dental graduates stepping into their first junior oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) role, the transition from general dental practice to a hospital setting can be daunting. Managing complex facial trauma, handling orofacial emergencies, and adapting to new medical concepts are just a few of the challenges they face. On-call shifts, an almost inevitable aspect of OMFS roles, add further complexity.1 This article aims to review the key resources available to help dental graduates prepare for, and succeed in, their OMFS roles.
Material and methods
A survey was conducted among dental graduates currently or recently employed in junior OMFS roles, such as dental core trainees (DCTs), across the UK. The survey asked which resources were most useful when preparing for, and during, their OMFS roles, and what additional resources or training they would find beneficial. The questionnaire was distributed across the country via social media channels including the Junior Trainees’ Group (JTG) of the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons’ (BAOMS) Facebook page, gaining responses from all regions across the country. A total of 61 responses were received.
Results and Discussion
Table 1 lists the resources that were cited most frequently by the participants. Those most frequently mentioned were the “Dentist on the Ward” by Sadler and Cheng and the “Oxford Handbook of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery” by Luke Cascarini et al, each cited by 53.3% of respondents. “Dentist on the Ward” is particularly valued for its accessible introduction to the hospital environment and common OMFS scenarios, tailored specifically for dentists.2 The “Oxford Handbook,” though not specifically for dental graduates, is praised for its practical advice and compact size, making it a handy reference during on-call shifts.3

The book, “On-Call in Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery”4 was mentioned by 30% of respondents, appreciated for its practical, hands-on advice and visual guides. The BAOMS website was highlighted by 15% of respondents, particularly its “eFace” e-learning platform,5 which offers targeted training for junior OMFS trainees. However, awareness of the “eFace” resource was relatively low, with only 16.7% of respondents mentioning it.
Other resources mentioned included FlexFacs, an online platform offering live lectures and recorded content mapped to the OMFS curriculum6 (cited by 6.7% of respondents), and omfssurvivalguide.co.uk7 (4.9%) and omfsho.com8 (3.3%), both online websites developed by trainees for junior OMFS trainees, which provide practical insights and lecture recordings directly relevant to junior OMFS work.
When asked about additional resources or training that would be helpful, respondents pointed out the lack of awareness of existing tools, and suggested developing a small, portable guide specifically for dental graduates entering OMFS roles. Others proposed the creation of an OMFS-specific app, comparable to those available in other specialties like ENT.

Conclusion
This review highlights the wide range of resources available to dental graduates entering OMFS roles, with particular emphasis on a few key tools that have been found to be most helpful. However, the findings also suggest gaps in awareness and accessibility of these resources, indicating potential areas for development.
In conclusion, addressing any gaps in training resources for DCTs is crucial. By providing comprehensive support and resources, we not only enhance their learning experience but also ignite their passion for the specialty. This increased interest can inspire many to pursue a second degree and a career in OMFS, ultimately helping to solve the ongoing challenges of recruitment and retention in the field.

It is also used in aesthetic surgery and access surgery. Different approaches of transconjunctival surgery, however, can be complicated by the complex lower lid anatomy. In this publication we revisit the anatomy of the transconjunctival approach, and discuss the surgical steps for preseptal and postseptal dissection. We introduce the concept of interseptal space (potential space), its anatomy first described in 1991.","Introduction
The transconjunctival approach was first described in 1923.1,2 Tessier applauded Bourqet for using this approach in lower eye lid blepharoplasty.2,3 Since then it has been used to access the orbital walls and infraorbital rim, and in the management of orbital fat. The approach is used in trauma, aesthetic, deformity, and access surgery.4,5 The hidden surgical incision, which results in excellent cosmesis and comparatively fewer reported complications when compared with transcutaneous approaches, has resulted in it gaining popularity among surgeons.5,6 However, the anatomy described is somewhat confusing so we have attempted to clarify it based on histology and surgical experience.
Related anatomy
The anatomy of the lower eye lid ideally should be divided into anterior, middle, and posterior lamellae,1,2 although in some literature it is divided into only two compartments. The components of the anterior lamella include skin, subcutaneous tissue, and the orbicularis oculi muscle. The middle lamella consists of the tarsal plate and orbital septum, and the posterior lamella includes the palpebral conjunctiva, lower lid retractors (including Muller’s muscle), and capsulopalpebral fascia.
The orbital septum fuses inferiorly with the periosteum of the inferior orbital rim at the arcus marginalis and superiorly with the lower eye lid retractors, beginning approximately 4 - 5 mm inferior to the inferior tarsal border.2 In 1991 Ilankovan presented a cadaveric and clinical study describing a potential space between the capsulopalpebral fascia and orbital septum, which extends up to the arcus marginalis (Fig. 1).2 The presence of this potential space was described as interseptal space by us, and this was further strengthened by another study by Tiwari et al, who identified a separate fascial layer away from the periorbita which, they claimed, was another route for the spread of orbital tumours.5 We believe therefore that there should be three planes of dissection for the transconjunctival approach, namely preseptal, postseptal, and interseptal.

Preseptal and retroseptal approaches
The palpebral conjunctiva is sharply incised just below the inferior margin of the tarsal plate. The extensions of the incisions should be decided by the operator to allow adequate exposure. The palpebral conjunctival flap dissected posteriorly can be retracted superiorly and sutured to the skin of the upper lid to protect the cornea. Dissection should now go through the capsulopalpebral fascia and orbital septum. To enter the preseptal space, the fascial connections between the septum and the posterior surface of the preseptal orbicularis oculi should be dissected bluntly. The dissection then proceeds between the muscle and the septum, similar to a percutaneous approach.
In the retroseptal approach, after sharply incising the palpebral conjunctiva, the dissection proceeds through the capsulopalpebral fascia and orbital fat to reach the arcus marginalis. Fat prolapse is commonly seen in this approach.
The “interseptal” approach
The incision along the palpebral conjunctiva is made just below the inferior border of the tarsal plate. The conjunctival flap is dissected and sutured to the upper lid to prevent damage to the cornea. The dissection proceeds after releasing the capsulopalpebral fascia and lower lid retractors. There is a plane where it is lined by septum anteriorly and posteriorly, or along the posterior lining of the Tiwari layer without exposure of the orbital fat and orbicularis oculi muscle. This space was also illustrated as a “potential space” by Spinelli (Fig. 2).6 The dissection plane will lead us to the arcus marginalis.

Discussion
Over the past few decades the transconjunctival approach has gained in popularity over transcutaneous incisions, mainly in trauma management.5 In fact, most authors believe that the transconjunctival incision is the best surgical approach with the luxury of a well-hidden scar and low complication rate.1,2,6 One of the major drawbacks against this approach, however, is limited surgical exposure. This is overcome by combining the above with a transcaruncular approach to expose fractures of the orbital floor and medial wall, and a lateral canthotomy for wide exposure of the lateral orbital wall.5,6 Nonetheless, many authors suggest that lateral canthotomy should not be taken lightly, as most lower eye lid problems are related to malposition of the lateral canthus.4,5 The reason is that accurate reattachment of the lateral canthus is challenging and can cause blunting of the sharp definition of the canthus.
In general, two different routes are described as stated above. Although there is conflicting evidence, many authors prefer the preseptal to the retroseptal approach for multiple reasons.5–7 In the retroseptal approach the extensive dissection through the intraorbital connective tissue framework and lower lid retractors can increase adhesions and fibrosis of the conjunctiva, fat, and lower lid retractors. The risk of scarring the intraorbital connective tissue framework and anterior part of the orbital fat can lead to ocular motility disorders and enophthalmos.5,7 Exposure of the orbital fat during dissection is another challenging task. This can also contribute to vertical lid shortening or entropion, which is associated with the transconjunctival approach.
The preseptal approach allows dissection of the inferior tarsal muscle and the capsulopalpebral fascia to gain access to the preseptal space, thus the risks stated above are said to be low.5,6 In addition, orbital fat is directly encountered in the retroseptal approach, and visibility of the surgical field is reduced due to prolapsed orbital fat. Baumann and Ewers, although favouring the preseptal approach, stated that the retroseptal approach could be beneficial in lower eye lid blepharoplasty.8 It is therefore up to the clinician to decide on the approach depending on the intent of surgery. On the other hand, studies that depict the preseptal approach suggest that it is more technically challenging than the retroseptal approach, and takes longer.6,7
In aesthetic surgery, the retroseptal transconjuctival approach is used to carry out excision of prolapsed fat. Currently, the majority of aesthetic surgeons do not advocate excision of herniated fat as it can lead to a sunken lower lid. Hamra advocated the fat preservation approach for septal reset.9
We have found that the interseptal approach will facilitate septal reset without fat reduction. Also, with our surgical experience over the years we have found that the interseptal approach better achieves subperiosteal dissection to expose the orbital floor and medial and lateral walls for fracture repair without requiring canthotomy or a transcaruncular approach.
In summary, the interseptal approach is easier and quicker, and provides adequate surgical exposure with few complications, and we encourage surgeons to consider it as an option.

The study emphasizes that this approach, which offers a hidden incision and excellent cosmesis, has become increasingly popular among surgeons compared to traditional transcutaneous techniques due to its lower complication rates.

A central component of the project is a detailed analysis of lower eyelid anatomy. The eyelid is divided into anterior, middle, and posterior lamellae, with each layer comprising specific tissues such as skin and orbicularis oculi (anterior), tarsal plate and orbital septum (middle), and palpebral conjunctiva with associated retractor muscles (posterior). Special attention is given to the fusion of the orbital septum with the periosteum at the arcus marginalis, and to the identification of a potential interseptal space between the capsulopalpebral fascia and the orbital septum—a finding that corroborates earlier cadaveric and clinical studies.

The authors describe three distinct dissection planes: preseptal, retroseptal, and interseptal. The preseptal approach, though technically more demanding, minimizes exposure of orbital fat and reduces risks of adhesions and fibrosis. In contrast, the retroseptal approach, while useful in specific aesthetic procedures, may increase the likelihood of fat prolapse and subsequent complications. The study advocates the interseptal approach as a superior alternative that facilitates efficient septal reset and subperiosteal dissection for orbital fracture repair without necessitating additional incisions. Overall, the project encourages surgeons to consider the interseptal route for its ease, speed, and favorable safety profile.","This research paper explores the transconjunctival approach, a popular surgical technique accessing the orbit through the lower eyelid for trauma, aesthetic, and reconstructive purposes. While praised for its hidden incision and reduced complications compared to transcutaneous methods, anatomical understanding remains confusing. The authors clarify lower eyelid anatomy, traditionally divided into anterior, middle, and posterior lamellae, emphasizing the orbital septum and capsulopalpebral fascia. They propose a third, ""interseptal"" plane of dissection, building on previous studies highlighting a potential space between these structures. The paper compares the traditional preseptal and retroseptal approaches, noting risks like adhesions, scarring, and fat prolapse with the retroseptal method. They argue the interseptal approach, situated between the septum and a separate fascial layer, offers advantages, including easier access to the orbital floor and walls, facilitating septal reset and fracture repair without needing additional procedures like canthotomy. Ultimately, the authors advocate for the interseptal approach due to its ease, speed, adequate exposure, and low complication rate.","This research paper explores the transconjunctival surgical approach, which has gained popularity for accessing the orbital walls and infraorbital rim due to its hidden incision, excellent cosmetic outcomes, and lower complication rates compared to transcutaneous methods. The approach is widely used in trauma, aesthetic, and reconstructive surgeries. The paper clarifies the anatomy of the lower eyelid, dividing it into anterior, middle, and posterior lamellae, and introduces the concept of an ""interseptal space"" between the capsulopalpebral fascia and orbital septum, supported by histological evidence and surgical experience.

Three dissection planes are described: preseptal, retroseptal, and interseptal. The preseptal approach involves dissecting between the orbicularis oculi muscle and the orbital septum, while the retroseptal approach involves dissecting through orbital fat, often leading to fat prolapse. The interseptal approach, a novel contribution, involves dissecting within the potential space between the septum and capsulopalpebral fascia, offering a balance between the two traditional methods. This approach avoids direct exposure of orbital fat and reduces the risk of complications such as scarring, fibrosis, and eyelid malposition.

The paper highlights the advantages of the interseptal approach, including easier subperiosteal dissection for orbital floor and wall fractures, reduced need for lateral canthotomy, and preservation of orbital fat in aesthetic procedures. The authors argue that the interseptal approach provides adequate surgical exposure with fewer complications and shorter operative times, making it a viable alternative to traditional methods. They encourage surgeons to consider this approach for its technical ease and favorable outcomes. The study concludes that the interseptal approach is a valuable option in orbital surgery, combining the benefits of both preseptal and retroseptal techniques while minimizing risks.",9,3.5,13.89,,,90,90,10,95,80,85,15,90,85,88,10,95

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis is a pathological condition characterised by formation of a bony or fibrotic union between the mandibular condyle and glenoid fossa. It can happen either unilaterally or bilaterally and causes restricted mouth opening which impairs daily function including speech, mastication, and oral hygiene practices.1–3 In the paediatric population it leads to impaired growth of the mandible and results in micrognathia and retrognathia, which can contribute to the characteristic “bird profile”.4,5 The retrognathic and micrognathic mandible usually causes retro-displacement of the tongue, resulting in narrowing or obstruction of the oropharyngeal airway and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) syndrome.1–5 The triad of TMJ ankylosis, micrognathia, and OSA has increasingly been reported in the literature as the classic clinical feature of TMJ ankylosis in the growing population.1–3,6
Andrade et al proposed that the treatment principles for the management of patients with characteristic triads should aim to address each component: release of TMJ ankylosis, and mandibular advancement to correct micrognathia, which will simultaneously enlarge the collapsed posterior airway space (PAS) and relieve OSA.2 Subsequently many authors have reported variation in the surgical interventions used to treat these patients, while working along the above principles.
This article aims to present a comprehensive systematic review of the surgical strategies used in the management of these patients, with the objective of finding the most favourable intervention to achieve optimum functional rehabilitation.
Material and methods
Protocol development
This systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with the registration number CRD42024526325, and was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.7 A protocol was developed based on the PICO framework for the selection of studies:
Population: patients with the triad of conditions, namely TMJ ankylosis, micrognathia, and OSA
Intervention: surgical interventions to treat the triad of conditions
Comparison: different surgical strategies to correct the triad of conditions
Outcome: postoperative outcomes such as mouth opening, incidence of reankylosis, amount of mandibular advancement, and the status of OSA.
Focus question
The focused question for this review was whether there is any difference in outcome between the different surgical interventions used in the management of patients with the triad of TMJ ankylosis, micrognathia, and OSA. The primary outcomes considered were differences in maximum mouth opening (MMO), incidence of reankylosis, amount of mandibular advancement, posterior airway space (PAS), apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI), and arterial oxygen saturation before and after surgical intervention. Secondary outcomes were changes in other cephalometric or polysomnographic variables.
Information sources and search strategy
A literature search was performed via PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, based on PRISMA guidelines7 using the keywords: “Temporomandibular joint”, “TMJ”, “Ankylosis”, “Micrognathia”, “Obstructive sleep apnoea”, “OSA”, “Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome”, “OSAS”, and “Surgery”. Reference lists of accepted systematic reviews were also checked for additional studies.
Selection criteria
Studies in English that included patients of any age and gender with the triad of unilateral or bilateral TMJ ankylosis, micrognathia, and OSA, were included. Studies with the highest level of scientific evidence, that is, systematic reviews (preferably with meta-analysis), randomised controlled trials, and prospective studies were sought, but other types of studies, case series, and case reports, were also included. Animal studies, cadaveric studies, and any that were not focused on surgical techniques, were excluded.
Screening methods
Two reviewers (TFY and CTK) initially screened the abstracts before full-text manuscripts were obtained and summarised. Final data analysis was performed independently by two other reviewers (TJHS and FH).
Data extraction
The following data were extracted from studies that met the selection criteria: author(s), year of publication, study design, number of patients, age, diagnosis, surgical technique, outcomes, incidence of reankylosis, and follow-up period.
Quality assessment
Quality assessment was based on the Cochrane Reviewer's Handbook, 2009 by Higgins and Green.8 The quality criteria evaluated were randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, and completeness to follow up. Each criterion was assessed with “yes”, “no”, or “unclear”. The study was classified to be at high risk of bias if it did not record a “yes” in three or more of the four main categories, at moderate risk if two of the categories did not record a “yes,” and at low risk if all four categories recorded a “yes”. In the case of non-randomised and clinical trials with no control group, “not applicable” was recorded. Table 1 shows the risk of bias in the included studies.

Results
A literature search on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus yielded 121 results while additional studies were also included from the reference list of an accepted systematic review. From a total of 118 research articles, 34 were included after screening and exclusion. The selection process was based on PRISMA guidelines7 as elaborated in Figure 1. As shown in Table 1, all the selected papers were not randomised and had a high risk of bias. The detailed characteristics of the 34 studies are given in Supplemental Table 2 (online only) (1 systematic review, 9 prospective studies, 1 pilot study, 3 clinical studies, 1 cross-sectional study, 4 case series, and 15 case reports). The follow-up periods varied from 1 month to 12 years. The total sample size of all the studies was 360. Thirteen studies included children only, five included adults only, while the remaining 16 included both.1–6,9–36

Surgical intervention involving mandibular advancement alone was reported in one case report, two case series, one cross-sectional study, and one prospective study, whereas intervention involving release of TMJ ankylosis alone was reported in only one case report. Interventions involving both mandibular advancement and release of TMJ ankylosis were reported in the remaining 28 studies, in which mandibular advancement was done via distraction osteogenesis (DO) in 25. In studies that did not use DO, mandibular advancement was achieved via bilateral inverse L osteotomy of ramus and iliac bone grafting (n = 1), and a combination of bilateral Epker osteotomy and bilateral vertical osteotomy at the symphyseal region anterior to the mental foramen (n = 1). Among the studies that reported different protocols for surgical intervention involving both the release of TMJ ankylosis and mandibular advancement via DO, six reported simultaneous arthroplasty and DO (SAD), 12 reported pre-athroplasty DO (PrAD), and three post-athroplasty DO (PAD). One clinical study discussed the use of PrAD and PAD, while one systematic review compared outcomes between surgical protocols involving SAD, PrAD, and PAD. Other additional procedures for mandibular advancement such as genioplasty were also reported. The variation in the sequence and combination of arthroplasty and DO is illustrated in Figure 2.

In terms of TMJ ankylosis, the most common surgical intervention was interpositional gap arthroplasty (11 studies), other surgical options being gap arthroplasty (4 studies), costochondral grafts (CCG) (1 study), transport DO (1 study), removal of fibrous adhesion (1 study), and arthroplasty with disc repositioning (1 study). Seven studies reported more than one approach, while three did not mention the exact type of procedure for the release of ankylosis. Many authors also performed coronoidectomy in addition to release of ankylosis to optimise mouth opening.
One case report described a case with follow up from 2 - 19 years of age in which DO and bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) were used for mandibular advancement, and a combination of gap arthroplasty (GA), interpositional gap arthroplasty (IGA), coronoidectomy and, eventually, total joint prosthesis, were used for the management of TMJ ankylosis.
Mouth opening
The primary outcome for the treatment of TMJ ankylosis was the change in mouth opening, which was objectively measured in 24 of 29 articles that reported release of ankylosis. Most surgical management achieved a significant gain in mouth opening, with most of the patients achieving functional mouth opening of more than 25 mm after treatment.
Reankylosis
The incidence of reankylosis was evaluated in 16 of 29 studies that reported release of TMJ ankylosis. Reankylosis was reported in 12 subjects in two case reports, one prospective study, and one clinical study. Four subjects were treated with SAD using either GA (n = 3) or IGA (n = 1), while the remaining eight underwent PAD, treated either with GA (n = 1) or IGA (n = 7). The reason for reankylosis was reported to be poor compliance with, or intolerance of, mouth opening exercises after surgery. Similarly, the systematic review by Albert and Muthusekhar concluded that reankylosis was reported more in PAD followed by SAD, with none in PrAD. HYPERLINK ""SPS:refid::bib1"" 1
Mandibular advancement
In terms of the treatment for micrognathia or retrognathia, the distance of mandibular advancement was measured as an outcome for the different surgical strategies used. The amount of advancement achieved by authors using DO (6–34 mm) was more than that in studies that reported mandibular advancement without DO (10–15 mm). Meanwhile, in their systematic review, Albert and Muthusekhar reported that change in mandibular length occurred sooner in patients treated with PrAD and SAD than in those in whom PAD was indicated due to a delay in DO after arthroplasty. HYPERLINK ""SPS:refid::bib1"" 1
Apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)
Fifteen studies reported the AHI as the treatment outcome. For studies that described the release of TMJ ankylosis and DO as the treatment protocol, a post-intervention outcome of no OSA (AHI < 5) to mild OSA (AHI between 5 and 15) was reported in almost all cases treated by PrAD, whereas in cases treated by SAD and PAD a post-intervention AHI in the mild OSA category (AHI between 5 and 15) was reported. In one study that treated triad patients with a preoperative AHI as high as 163, the PrAD approach managed to reduce it to between 0 and 18.1. Studies using DO alone for the treatment of triad patients reported slightly less optimum outcomes in terms of AHI, with post-intervention readings between 0.5 and 28.6. Treatment with a combination of IGA and Epker osteotomy also reported a post-surgical AHI reduction from 38 to 0.
Oxygen saturation
Of the five studies reporting lowest arterial oxygen saturation, SAD provided the most optimum reading (98.2%) followed by PrAD (2 studies reporting lowest oxygen saturation of 93% and between 68% and 94.6%) and PAD (2 studies with lowest oxygen saturation of 81% and 92.9%). Six studies that evaluated OSA in terms of mean oxygen saturation used PrAD as their surgical strategy of choice (a range of post-intervention readings between 80% and 98.4% was achieved), while the other study reported post-intervention readings of 94% to 96% after surgical intervention involving DO only. The author who reported the lowest post-intervention mean oxygen saturation of 80% also treated the subject with the lowest pre-intervention reading of 55%.
Posterior airway space (PAS)
Studies with measurements of PAS involved the use of PrAD (5 studies), DO only (1 study), ankylosis release and genioplasty (1 study), SAD (1 study), and bilateral inverse L osteotomy of ramus and iliac bone grafting (1 study), all of which were able to achieve PAS of between 7 mm and 15 mm. Similar improvements in OSA symptoms for subjects in the PrAD and SAD groups were noted by Albert and Muthusekhar in their systematic review.1 However, in contrast to the findings of the present review, the same systematic review reported worsening polysomnographic data among subjects in the PAD group.
Discussion
Based on current literature, there is a well-established link between OSA and mandibular deformity secondary to TMJ ankylosis.1–5 Polysomnography and CT scans therefore need to be performed in patients with TMJ ankylosis to assess the airway and to plan treatment. The AHI is used to grade the severity of OSA where, in the paediatric population 1–4.9 events/hour is mild, 5–9.9 events/hour is moderate, and more than 10 events/hour severe. Most clinical presentations can be observed by parents during sleep. They include snoring, paradoxical breathing, gasping, restless sleep, frequent awakening, respiratory pauses, diaphoresis, and enuresis. Daytime presentation of OSA in children differs from that in adults in whom neurobehavioural sequelae (rather than daytime somnolence) are more often present. These clinical features are thought to be the result of chronic exposure to intermittent hypoxemia and sleep deprivation, and can fall into two main categories: behavioural (aggression, impulsivity, and hyperactivity) and neurocognitive (deficits in attention, executive function, and language).37 Cardiac workup is necessary prior to surgical management especially in patients with long-standing, severe OSA to rule out problems such as pulmonary and systemic hypertension as well as right ventricular hypertrophy.37,38 Poor growth and failure to thrive due to increased baseline calorific expenditure for breathing effort and reduced growth hormone secretion due to fragmented sleep can also be seen in this group of patients.38
A recent systematic review by Albert and Muthusekhar in 2021 provided a comprehensive overview of the surgical outcome of different treatment sequences involving DO for the management of patients with TMJ ankylosis and micrognathia.1 Of the 10 studies included, only six reported parameters for the assessment of OSA. The scope of the review also did not include mandibular advancement using methods other than DO or triad patients who were treated only with DO without release of TMJ ankylosis. The present review has aimed to add to previous systematic reviews in terms of functional outcomes with more emphasis on changes in OSA parameters, as well as the inclusion of methods other than TMJ ankylosis and DO for the comparison of treatment outcomes.
In the management of the triad of TMJ ankylosis, micrognathia, and OSA in growing patients, the ultimate goal of surgical treatment is to allow advancement of the hypoplastic mandible and widening of the obstructed oropharyngeal airway, and to ensure mobility of the condyle. Andrade et al discussed five surgical options for the treatment of TMJ ankylosis and micrognathia: release of TMJ ankylosis alone, release of TMJ ankylosis with reconstruction using a CCG, simultaneous release of TMJ ankylosis and mandibular distraction, two-stage surgery involving release of TMJ ankylosis followed by mandibular distraction, and two-stage surgery involving mandibular distraction followed by release of TMJ ankylosis.2
Option one involves release of TMJ ankylosis only. Based on the present narrative review, most surgical procedures reported in the literature, including interpositional gap arthroplasty, gap arthroplasty, CCG, transport DO, removal of fibrous adhesion, and arthroplasty with disc repositioning, result in adequate mouth opening of at least 25 mm.1–4,6,16,18,21,22,24,26,27,30,32,35,36 Nevertheless, this option is more suitable for patients with isolated TMJ ankylosis without micrognathia or OSA. When treatment for micrognathia is required, options two to five are more appropriate, as they allow lengthening of the mandible with growth. The choice of the most suitable approach will depend on the OSA status of the patient.
Option two comprises release of TMJ ankylosis followed by correction of micrognathia using a CCG, which is believed to possess growth potential. Alternatives to CCG include autogenous bone grafts from the coronoid process, tibial or clavicular bone, sternoclavicular joint, iliac crest, metatarsal bone, or metatarsophalangeal articulation.39,40 However, this approach does not provide an immediate solution to the respiratory issues caused by OSA and thus is not the preferred surgical treatment for triad patients.2 Furthermore, the surgical outcome of CCG has been reported to be unpredictable, with problems such as overgrowth, absent or suboptimal growth, ankylosis of the TMJ following reconstruction, and graft resorption or necrosis.41–43
Surgical treatments that combine release of TMJ ankylosis with mandibular advancement via DO (options 3, 4, and 5) have shown advantages over the use of CCG, including shortened surgery time and length of stay, lower risk of relapse, concurrent lengthening of both hard and soft tissues,40,43 and lack of donor-site morbidity.40,43,44 Disadvantages of DO are related to the cost of distraction devices, as well as the need for the device to remain in place throughout the distraction and consolidation period.40 Nevertheless, the controlled direction and amount of bony lengthening offered by DO 40,43 makes it a more ideal option for the treatment of patients with respiratory issues secondary to OSA.
To solve both the issues of TMJ ankylosis and micrognathia in a single operation, option 3 is a tempting approach for the oral and maxillofacial surgeon. Indeed, many case series and case reports have shown successful outcomes using this option for the management of TMJ ankylosis and hypoplastic mandible.18,21,22,35,36 Despite successful outcomes, however, several concerns may still arise when using this approach to treat triad patients with bilateral TMJ ankylosis. Firstly, the need for aggressive mouth opening exercises after the release of TMJ ankylosis may result in constant movement and stretching of the distraction site, causing fibrous union or pseudoarthrosis. Secondly, the difficulty in predicting the mandibular position after condylectomy or release of TMJ ankylosis, and the need for continuous active physical therapy, contribute to the challenge of establishing occlusal stability after simultaneous bilateral release of TMJ ankylosis and mandibular DO. For these reasons, many authors propose the use of a two-stage surgery (options 4 and 5) if the patient requires it.2,45
Proponents of the release of TMJ ankylosis followed by mandibular DO (option 4) believe that it is better to stabilise the mandible after the release of ankylosis before deciding on the position and vector of the mandibular distraction devices. Kwon et al reported success in the management of patients with this approach.45 Andrade et al reported a series of 15 cases managed with two-stage surgery, with their initial protocol being the release of ankylosis followed by mandibular DO.2 The study found that in patients with severe OSA, forced mouth opening tended to trigger choking episodes, bradycardia, and desaturation, which the authors attributed to obstruction of the posterior airway space and trigeminocardiac reflex. These symptoms often lead to non-compliance with jaw physiotherapy and reankylosis. Staged surgery involving mandibular DO followed by release of ankylosis is therefore suggested for patients with severe OSA.2 A summary of the treatment strategy from this systematic review is further illustrated in Figure 3, which shows a proposed decision flow chart for the appropriate surgical management of patients with TMJ ankylosis. Nevertheless, this review must be interpreted with some caution, as it is unfortunately impossible to draw a reliable conclusion due to the low level of literature evidence, high risk of bias, and limited sample size.

This study acknowledges that TMJ ankylosis is a complex disease with many possible sequelae and associated presentations, including micrognathia and OSA, which potentially require multiple staged operations to be planned over extended periods. This systematic review has a limitation as it was not able to comprehensively determine the degree of TMJ ankylosis. The diversity and nature of tissue ankylosis would ideally require a case-based approach. Further research initiatives in this field are recommended to identify the optimum intervention that can be tailored to each specific condition. In addition, other surgical interventions such as fat tissue grafts, and a combination of orthognathic surgery and TMJ prostheses, must not be excluded.
Perioperative assessment and management of systemic disorders related to OSA, including airway management, are important aspects that are best approached via a multi-disciplinary approach. This systematic review shows that the diversity and nature of TMJ ankylosis would ideally require a case-based surgical strategy. Even though PrAD, which is a favoured option due to the ability to lengthen the mandible, helps alleviate respiratory issues caused by OSA, simultaneous release of TMJ ankylosis and mandibular DO show promising outcomes, but may pose challenges such as maintaining occlusal stability and managing postoperative complications. For severe OSA cases, staged surgery may be necessary to optimise outcomes. In conclusion, effective case-specific management of TMJ ankylosis, micrognathia, and OSA in growing patients requires careful consideration of the surgical options that promote mandibular advancement and airway improvement. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial for managing these complex cases effectively, and further research is needed to refine the surgical techniques and improve outcomes.

Ethics statement/confirmation of patients’ permission
Ethics approval and patient consent not required.","Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis is a condition where a bony or fibrotic fusion occurs between the mandibular condyle and glenoid fossa, leading to restricted mouth opening and subsequent functional impairments in speech, mastication, and oral hygiene. In growing patients, this condition often results in mandibular growth disturbances, causing micrognathia and retrognathia, which further contribute to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) due to a narrowed oropharyngeal airway. The reviewed systematic study aimed to compare various surgical interventions addressing the triad of TMJ ankylosis, micrognathia, and OSA. Following PRISMA guidelines and registered with PROSPERO, the literature search across PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus identified 34 relevant studies, involving 360 patients with follow-up durations ranging from one month to 12 years. The surgical strategies evaluated included isolated TMJ ankylosis release, mandibular advancement alone, and combined approaches where both procedures were performed concurrently or in stages. Distraction osteogenesis (DO) was the primary technique for mandibular advancement in 25 studies, with approaches subdivided into simultaneous arthroplasty and DO (SAD), pre-arthroplasty DO (PrAD), and post-arthroplasty DO (PAD). Outcome measures focused on maximum mouth opening, incidence of reankylosis, extent of mandibular advancement, posterior airway space, apnea-hypopnea index, and oxygen saturation. Results indicated significant improvements in mouth opening and respiratory function, with PrAD showing fewer complications. The study concludes that optimal management of this complex triad requires a tailored, multidisciplinary approach, though further research is needed due to limited high-quality evidence. Moreover, the review emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment planning and multidisciplinary collaboration to optimize long-term outcomes critically.","This systematic review examines surgical strategies for treating temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis, micrognathia, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) - a triad often seen in children. The study aimed to determine the most effective surgical intervention for optimal functional rehabilitation. The review analyzed 34 studies, finding that surgical interventions typically involve releasing the TMJ ankylosis and addressing micrognathia, often through mandibular advancement. Mandibular advancement was achieved using distraction osteogenesis (DO), with variations in timing: simultaneous (SAD), pre-arthroplasty (PrAD), and post-arthroplasty (PAD) DO. Most studies reported significant improvement in mouth opening post-surgery. Reankylosis occurred in some cases, potentially due to non-compliance with post-operative exercises. The study found that Mandibular advancement by distraction osteogenesis (DO) achieved greater distances than without. PrAD tended to be associated with a return to the pre-operative OSA levels, while PAD and SAD gave a post-operative profile slightly higher than the pre-operative AHI levels, and a post-intervention AHI in the mild OSA category. The authors concluded that careful consideration of surgical options and a multidisciplinary approach are crucial for effective case-specific management. The high risk of bias and limited sample size of the studies included in this review means that there is no reliable conclusion to the presented outcomes.","This systematic review examines surgical strategies for managing the triad of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis, micrognathia, and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in paediatric and adult patients.

The review, following PRISMA guidelines, analysed 34 studies (360 patients) to evaluate outcomes such as mouth opening, reankylosis rates, mandibular advancement, and OSA improvement. Surgical interventions included gap arthroplasty, distraction osteogenesis (DO), and costochondral grafts (CCG). Key findings indicate that combined TMJ ankylosis release and mandibular advancement via DO (pre-arthroplasty DO [PrAD], simultaneous arthroplasty DO [SAD], or post-arthroplasty DO [PAD]) yielded the best functional outcomes. PrAD was particularly effective in improving OSA symptoms, with significant reductions in the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) and increased posterior airway space (PAS). However, SAD and PAD showed higher reankylosis rates, attributed to poor compliance with postoperative physiotherapy.

The 2008 Review of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) Training1 was, and is, the most extensive and expensive review of OMFS training in the world. It was jointly chaired by Peter Rubin, chair of the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Body (PMETB) and Barry Cockcroft, Chief Dental Officer of England. The politics around the review have been discussed.2–4 This paper will look at the specialty’s current views on its five OMFS-specific recommendations.
Method
An online survey was created to assess awareness of the PMETB review and the current views of OMFS trainees and consultants in the context of its recommendations. Trainees at all levels and consultants/specialists were contacted using email and social media (WhatsApp, Twitter, and Facebook). Use of social media made a denominator impossible to calculate. To encourage participation a prize draw was offered. Analysis was undertaken on Winstat®.
Results
Response rate
A total of 304 responses were received, eight of which were anonymous. Of those responding, 124 (41%) were consultants, 66 (22%) specialty trainees (STs), and 114 pre-specialty trainees (made up of 27 (9%) pre-second-degree studies, 61 (20%) second-degree students, and 26 (9%) post-second degree).
Defining the response rate is not possible because distribution included social media. For consultants the General Medical Council’s OMFS specialist list in January 2023 was used as the denominator. With 503 active OMFS specialists on the list, 124 consultants are 25%. For STs, of whom there are approximately 150, the response rate was 44%. Calculating a response rate for other groups was not possible.
Reviewing the first degree of those responding, 248 were ‘dentistry first’ (82%) and 48 ‘medicine first’ (16%). A total of 111 (90%) consultants were ‘dentistry-first’ and 12 (10%) ‘medicine-first’, similar proportions to the first degrees across the consultant body.5 For STs, 50 (76%) were ‘dentistry-first’ and 16 (24%) ‘medicine-first’, similar proportions to all UK STs (Table 1).2
Which recommendation(s) do you support?        No. (%)

Gender
Of those responding, 229 (75%) were male and 67 female (22%). Within the groups, 113 (91%) consultants were male, 10 (8%) female, and 1 (1%) unknown. For STs, 51 (77%) were male and 15 (23%) female. Seventeen (65%) post-second-degree trainees were male, 7 (27%) female, and 2 (8%) unknown, whilst 35 (57%) second-degree students were male, 25 (41%) female, and one (2%) unknown. Finally, 13 (48%) pre-second-degree trainees were male, 10 (37%) female, and 4 (15%) unknown. Gender distribution was similar to that across these groups as a whole.2
Support for PMETB recommendations by those responding (Table 1)
“Recommendation 1: The need for dual qualification - There should be no change to the current statutory requirement for those training in OMFS to obtain primary qualifications in both medicine and dentistry.”
This was supported by 255 (84%). Within trainee subgroups, 53 (80%) STs, 23 (88%) post-second-degree, 52 (85%) second-degree, and 21 (78%) pre-second-degree trainees supported this recommendation.
Considering the first degrees of those replying, 213 (86%) of those studying dentistry first supported this recommendation compared with 34 (71%) of those who were medicine-first, a difference that was statistically significant using a chi-squared test (0.01). There was no gender difference in the support for dual-degree OMFS.
“Recommendation 2: The duration of training - Discussions should take place with medical and dental schools and the regulators to explore ways of streamlining the education and training of those dentists or doctors who wish to pursue a career in OMFS. Any reduction in the length of training leading to a primary qualification must be compatible with the European Professional Qualifications Directive 2005/36”.
This was supported by 283 (93%). The support did not vary significantly with first degree, gender, or stage of OMFS training.
“Recommendation 3: The training pathway: when should training begin? - Since OMFS is unique in requiring two primary qualifications, we recommend that all those responsible for training in the specialty explore the feasibility of beginning specialist OMFS training at the start of the second-degree course.”
This was supported by 203 (67%). Consultants were most in favour (n = 93, 75%) and pre-second-degree trainees least in favour (n = 8, 30%). There was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.03) between first degrees, with dentistry-first supporting strongly (70% n = 173) compared with medicine-first respondents (54% n = 26). There was no gender difference for this recommendation.
“Recommendation 4: Registration - Those on the specialist register in OMFS need be registered only with the GMC.”
This was strongly supported with 258 (85%) in favour. There were small variations within trainee subgroups and genders but these were not statistically significant.
“Recommendation 5: The relationship between Oral and Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery: there should be a separate review of the specialty of Oral Surgery.”
The Oral Surgery Review was published in 20126 making this the one recommendation of the review that has been delivered.
“Recommendation 6: Foundation programme – Dually qualified individuals who can demonstrate to the PMETB that they meet foundation year 2 (F2) competencies have the option to move directly into competition for specialty training programmes without completing F2. This does not alter the requirement to complete F1, which remains compulsory. The PMETB notes that the Department of Health for England intend to publish a review of the foundation programme later this year, and this may be subject to some change.”
This had the support of 260 (86%). The Review of Foundation Training was published in 2010 and did not recommend any changes in foundation training for OMFS trainees.7
Awareness of the PMETB review
The review was published in 2008 and included visits to OMFS units, evidence collection from a wide range of stakeholders, and the associated political lobbying which took place during the preceding two years. Overall, 136 (45%) of those responding said they were aware of the PMETB review prior to receiving the survey, 138 (45%) said they were unaware and, 28 (9%) were not sure.
Of 124 consultants responding to this question, 89 (71%) were aware of the report, 22 (18%) were not aware, and 13 (10%) ticked ‘not sure’. Of the 178 trainees responding, 47 (26%) were aware of the review, 116 (65%) were not aware, and 15 (8%) unsure. There were small differences between each trainee subgroup, but these were not statistically significant. There was no difference between male and females responding.
All those trainees who registered their interest in OMFS with BAOMS between 2010 and 2020 were sent the PMETB report.8 Some of the differences in knowledge of it may be explained by this.

Options to change OMFS training that could be within the control of the specialty
In the context of the failure of all stakeholders to deliver on any of the PMETB recommendations specific to OMFS, options were given that could be within the remit of the specialty to address. Free text was also offered. Of those replying, 102 (34%) chose the option to Formalise existing ‘shadow’ programmes (like the BAOMS Mentoring and Support Programme8) to demonstrate that ‘Run-Though-Max’ is possible, including national annual reviews of competency (ARCPs) for this group. The next largest group (n = 79, 26%) chose The creation of regional OMFS clinical fellows (with local appointment and national benchmarking akin to National Institute for Health and Care Research Academic Clinical Fellow and Academic Clinical Fellow posts - NIHR ACF/ACLs also known as Walport posts). Of those replying, 55 (18%) chose nothing to be done, not sure, or left the answer blank.
Next step for specialty / BAOMS
When those responding were asked to choose what should be the next step for the specialty, 83 (41%) chose ‘Lobby for when UK law is changed to remove references to EU directives to enable integration of the second degree into OMFS training’. The next two options with similar numbers were to ‘Focus on the most important recommendation and set a target for its delivery’ chosen by 55 (27%), and ‘Design and deliver a strategy to deliver on all recommendations with a specific target’ chosen by 49 (24%). ‘Nothing – recommendations are no longer relevant’ was chosen by 16 (8%).
Of those not expressing an opinion, 83 said they did not know and would need to read the report before deciding, and 18 left the answer blank.
Discussion
The PMETB review represented significant and detailed external scrutiny of OMFS training in the United Kingdom. As a dual-degree medical specialty, OMFS was seen as an ‘outlier’. The focus of the review’s co-chair, the Chief Dental Officer England, was the nature of the hospital dental specialty of Oral Surgery. The first two hospitals that the reviewers planned to visit as part of a review of OMFS training (Swindon and Lancaster) did not have any OMFS trainees. When the review team visited OMFS units and met patients in Glasgow, London, Sunderland, Brighton, and Salisbury, as well as Swindon and Lancaster, they understood why OMFS was a dual-degree specialty.
Recommendation 1: OMFS is a dual-degree specialty.
This was strongly supported at the time by the specialty and its patients. Vocal subgroups inside and outside the specialty question this ‘unique selling point’.3,9–11 Each time the question is asked the specialty as a whole responds to support OMFS as a dual-degree specialty.10 Across Europe, the majority of nations (n = 21) have dual-degree OMFS, including eight nations which have changed or are changing their specialty toward dual-degree OMFS and away from single-medical-degree OMFS with dental training but no dental degree.12,13 Even in the eight nations that do not require a dental degree, many OMFS surgeons are dually qualified because of the advantages this gives them in their clinical practice.
Recommendation 2: Shortening training
There is no evidence that any of the previous actions to shorten surgical training have worked.14 OMFS trainees joining the specialist list at similar ages to other surgical specialties reflects poorly on them (due to delay in CCT) rather than well on OMFS.15
Recommendation 3: Training should start at the beginning of the second degree
Previous attempts to create ‘Run-Through Max’, by incorporating the second degree into specialty training led by David Koppel and Patrick Magennis, were unsuccessful. The General Medical Council (GMC) considered that European law prevented this even though it was explained to them that the German medical authorities allow doctors to acquire a dental degree during their OMFS training.13 Dentistry-first trainees would need special arrangements for GMC oversight of training in the medical specialty of OMFS in the period before their final year when provisional GMC registration is possible.
Brexit could also allow a change in UK legislation from the current wording which requires OMFS surgeons' dental qualification to be ‘registrable’ by the General Dental Council to their dental qualification to be ‘recognised’ by the ENIC (European Network of Information Centres in the European Region) and NARIC (National Academic Recognition Information Centres in the European Union).16 This change would allow overseas dentists to train in the UK without needing the overseas registration examination (ORE). There has been a softening of the GDC's approach to non-registerable dental qualifications with the creation of provisional registration as well as temporary registration26.
Issues with shortened medical and dental courses, which were erroneously considered to be against EU law,17 have also been eliminated by Brexit.
Recommendation 4: OMFS should have a single regulator – the General Medical Council
In 2008 less than a handful of OMFS consultants had let their GDC registration lapse. In 2023, almost half of all consultants are solely on the medical register.18 Rationalising the regulation of OMFS with a Memorandum of Understanding between the GMC and GDC would be a significant advance for the specialty and would further clarify what the GDC defines as a ‘medical task’.19
Recommendation 6: Removing the need for Foundation Year 2 for OMFS trainees
Between 2010 and 2013, trainees who had passed their MRCS exam were able to enter specialty training without completing Foundation Year 2 (FY2) training or Core Surgical Training. This shortcut, avoiding FY2, was recommended by the PMETB and supported by ‘Modernising Medical Careers’ but stopped by the GMC based on EU regulations.20 The involved trainees successfully completed training with no detriment or delay21 and Brexit now introduces an option to change foundation training for OMFS trainees.
Other important issues post-dating the PMETB review
Student fees
Student fees have changed the financial consequences of dual-degree training. Most doctors will never pay off their first student loan,22 effectively paying 6% graduate tax for the remainder of their career. As rules mean that remaining debt is written off at the age of 65 or after 25–30 years (depending on which student loan ‘plan’ one is on) this creates a massive life-long debt with significant emotional impact.23
National recruitment
National recruitment started for OMFS in 2010. The process leaves some jobs unfilled when appointable applicants do not want to move home. Evidence-based options previously published recommend linking second-degree trainees formally into training programmes. There is currently support within the specialty to create ‘OMFS Run-Through-Max’ posts with NIHR ACF style regional recruitment and national bench-marking.27,20
BAOMS Mentoring and Support Programme (MSP)
This started in 2010 with support from the Severn Deanery and has had the highest conversion rate to STs of any programme.24
Conclusion
Hundreds of OMFS consultants, trainees, and patients contributed to the original review. For depth and breadth of consideration, nothing before or since has been similar.
Like all surgical specialties, OMFS is under pressure for both recruitment, retention, and managing an aging workforce.25 It is the responsibility of those currently leading the specialty to do their best under the current circumstances to support it now and plan for its future. To quote the title of an editorial from BJOMS only a few years ago “The future of OMFS lies in creating pathways to implement the PMETB recommendations and inspiring our trainees. Enough time has been spent debating, we need to deliver!”3

Chaired by Peter Rubin and Barry Cockcroft, the review critically examined the dual-degree requirement—mandating primary qualifications in both medicine and dentistry—and proposed key recommendations to enhance the training pathway and regulatory framework for OMFS. The study deployed an online survey targeting OMFS consultants, specialty trainees, and pre-specialty trainees via email and social media, ultimately collecting 304 responses. Among these, 124 respondents were consultants (representing 25% of active OMFS specialists) and 66 were specialty trainees (with a 44% response rate), while the remainder were pre-specialty trainees. Most participants were “dentistry-first” and predominantly male.

Respondents showed strong support for several recommendations: 84% endorsed maintaining the dual qualification requirement; 93% favored initiating discussions with medical and dental schools to streamline training; 85% agreed that specialists should register solely with the GMC; and 86% supported allowing OMFS trainees who demonstrate F2 competencies to bypass Foundation Year 2 (while retaining the compulsory F1 year). A notable 67% supported commencing specialist training at the start of the second degree, although this view varied among subgroups. Additionally, the survey revealed differences in prior awareness of the original PMETB review, with higher familiarity among consultants than trainees. The study concludes by highlighting proposals for future action—such as formalizing support programmes and lobbying for legislative changes—to ensure that the PMETB recommendations are effectively implemented, thereby securing the future of the specialty.","This study surveyed UK OMFS trainees and consultants to assess current views on the 2008 PMETB review's five OMFS-specific recommendations.

However, support was weaker for starting specialist training during the second degree (67%). A statistically significant difference was seen between medicine-first and dentistry-first degrees for the dual qualification and starting training early.

The duration of oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) training and its lack of continuity prior to specialty training (ST) raises unique problems. Previous publications have highlighted the attrition points1–3 and repeated geographical relocation is frequently cited as a problem by trainees.2
In 2008, the most extensive and expensive review of OMFS training undertaken by the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board (PMETB)4 recommended that specialty training should start with the second degree. All previous attempts to deliver this recommendation have failed. We propose it may be time to create a pathway for regions which already have all the components needed to deliver the PMETB recommendations to do so. The key elements of ‘OMFS Run-Through Max’ include OMFS selected second degree places, potential for OMFS foundation, ST1 or other surgical posts, which would allow the trainee to acquire Certificate of Requirements for Entry into Higher Specialty Training (CREHST), and OMFS ST3 posts.
‘Local recruitment and national benchmarking’ have been proven already for academic posts. In 2005, the Walport Report5 and the creation of the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR)6 led to nationally funded academic ‘Walport’ posts - Academic Clinical Fellows (ACF) and Academic Clinical Lecturers (ACL). ACFs and ACLs are locally appointed and then ‘benchmarked’ at the national ST selection process. They have proved a solution to the problem of academic recruitment.7
Once ACFs/ACLs were defined, training rotations and universities worked together to generate posts and appoint to them. ‘OMFS Run Through Max’ posts would require cooperation from universities, foundation schools, schools of surgery and employing Trusts/Lead Employers. The specific recruitment method for ACFs/ACLs was not defined. Applicants simply had to reach the same benchmark as their non-academic ST colleagues in the national selection process either before or after their ACF/ACL appointment.
OMFS specialty recruitment has been centralised since 2010. Whilst ST1 recruitment is competitive with a near 100% fill rate, the fill rates at ST3 level are much lower, with many posts rejected by appointable candidates.8,9 Many rejections were based on the location of the posts offered.2,10,11
The aim of this study was to ascertain attitudes towards the current recruitment process and views about potential routes to deliver on the PMETB recommendations, including creating a locally appointed nationally benchmarked variant on ‘Run-Through-Max’.
Method
In autumn 2022 an online survey was designed on Formdesk® to assess the opinion of OMFS consultants and trainees about the selection process into specialty training and the possibility of local ‘OMFS Run-Through-Max’ NIHR style Clinical Fellow posts. Invitations were shared using social media, direct e-mails, and personal communication, which made the denominator difficult to establish. To encourage participation, those who completed the questionnaire were offered entry into a prize draw.
The data were downloaded from FormDesk into Microsoft Excel © and analysed using Winstat©.
Recruitment data for Competition Ratios12 and Fill Rates13 for OMFS ST1 and ST3 were downloaded from specialty application data websites.
Results
When the survey closed, 306 participants had entered data in which eight did not include personal contact details. Participant breakdown by grade showed replies from 125 consultants (41%), 66 specialty trainees (22%) and 114 trainees aiming for specialty training, with one respondent whose status could not be identified. Of the 114 pre-ST trainees, 26 (9%) had completed two degrees and were either in foundation or core training, 61 (20%) were enrolled in second degree studies, and 27 (9%) were considering applying for a second degree. Of those whose first degree was known, 249 (81%) studied dentistry first and of all replying 75% (n = 230) were male where gender was reported.
Experience of national recruitment
Almost half (n = 147, 48%) of respondents had no experience of national recruitment (52 consultants). Older consultants responding would have been appointed into specialty training by local processes. and those pre-ST responding would not yet have experienced the selection process. Of the 157 (52%) with experience of the process, 120 (39% of all replying) had experience as a candidate only, 20 (7%) as a selector only and 17 (6%) experience as both candidate and selectors.
Views on local/regional recruitment vs national selection
Of 293 expressing an opinion on which form of selection they would consider most appropriate for OMFS specialty training, 155 (53%) preferred a local or regional process, 94 (32%) national selection and 44 (15%) did not express a preference either way. This distribution of preferences was similar across the different OMFS tiers except for Specialty Trainees who were evenly split and dual degree pre-ST trainees who preferred national selection (Table 1).

Further analysis of the 155 responders who supported local selection showed they were relatively evenly split between those who wanted local selection at ST1/ST3 with national benchmarking (n = 67, 43%), and those who wanted earlier selection during second degree training with national ARCP and later ST1/ST3 benchmarking 72 (46%). A minority of responders advocated local selection only (n = 16, 10%).
Of the 94 who supported national selection, the majority (62) wanted those appointed to have a wider window to be appointed i.e. to enable appointable candidates to take up posts which become available between recruitment rounds. The remaining 32 (34%) felt the current system was satisfactory.
Of the 29 with experience as a selector as part of national recruitment, 19 (66%) supported local selection. Of the 137 responders with no experience of national selection, 78 (57%) favoured local selection. Of the 126 whose only experience was as a candidate, 57 (45%) favoured local selection and 59 (47%) national selection.
Reasoning
The trainers supporting local/regional selection specified a wish to be more involved in trainee selection, which is currently limited to the relatively small group involved in the national recruitment process. Comments included a need for improved communication with regional Training Programme Directors (TPDs), especially when posts are unfilled. The lack of involvement of local faculty in the process lead to some trainers expressing frustration with a process in which trainees are ‘imposed’ upon them.
From the trainee perspective, geographical continuity was cited as the most important factor by that phase in life (Table 2). In comparison to other surgical specialties, personal commitments of OMFS trainees to location may be greater than other surgical specialties due to increased age. Many expressed their disappointment about the lack of contact with local OMFS units during and after their second degrees. Geographic security earlier in training was cited as an important factor to progress professionally through fostering strong relationships with local units.14

Routes to improve the current national selection process
Those who supported national selection specified fairness and openness as some of the advantages over local selection, and, that if a local/regional process was adopted, national benchmarking of the candidates would be important to avoid the worst aspects of the ‘old system’. Comments in favour of national recruitment included avoidance of unfair advantage and selection bias.
When respondents were asked to preference how to improve OMFS selection (Table 3), geographical continuity was most popular (61% of responders). Obtaining a training contract during second degree was second highest (n = 159, 60%) on total choices. Involvement of local faculty in candidate selection for that rotation was second in the first preferences (n = 48) but fourth (n = 117) when all the choices were combined. Closer support and assessment during second degree studies was ranked third in first choices (n = 35) and overall (n = 151).

Poor quality of candidates received from national selection was an option chosen by trainers/consultants and although the numbers are small, it is an important concern to acknowledge.
Factors within the control of the specialty
A total of 245 responders expressed opinions on factors which are within control of the specialty without direct involvement of other stakeholders. Of these, 102 (41%) chose to formalise existing ‘shadow’ programmes such as the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons Mentoring and Support Programme (BAOMS MSP)15 to demonstrate that ‘OMFS Run-though-Max is possible including national ARCPs for this group.
A smaller proportion of 79 (32%) chose to create Regional OMFS Clinical Fellows (with local appointment and national benchmarking like NIHR ACF/ACLs), leaving 68 (27%) who selected to widen the time window during which successful candidates at national selection can be appointed to a post which becomes vacant.
Discussion
The introduction of an OMFS national selection process followed the pan-specialty national recruitment calamity which was the Medical Training Application System (MTAS)16 and the Tooke Report of the independent inquiry into MTAS in 2008.14 When national selection was introduced for OMFS in 2010, under the supervision of the Modernising Medical Careers (MMC) team, it was much more autonomous than it is now.
For the first three rounds, possession of the MRCS was sufficient to demonstrate acquisition of Core Surgical knowledge, skills and understanding which meant some ‘dentistry first’ individuals entered ST3 from Foundation Training including some at the end of Foundation Year 1 (pre-registration year) FY1.17 In 2011, the General Medical Council stopped this approach.18 Local OMFS recruitment processes were suspended whilst a national process was organised. At the same time, the King’s Dental Programme for Medical Graduates (DPMG)19 was opened, which meant for those whose surgical career was halted by MTAS (because they had more than 24 months’ experience in their preferred specialty), switching to OMFS meant that the first seven rounds of OMFS ST3 national selection were competitive, and most candidates seemed to achieve their first choice posts.20
As time has passed, autonomy of the OMFS specialty within national recruitment has eroded. Two changes, which have had a direct negative impact on OMFS, have been the rules around timing of passing MRCS exam and use of the Multi-Specialty Recruitment Assessment (MSRA) for shortlisting. The former has prevented some OMFS candidates entering selection and delayed their appointment by 12 months. The latter impacted on all applicants but especially medicine first trainees who might be more than five years from their Foundation Training, having completed their dental degree and dental foundation training. From the start of OMFS national recruitment, OMFS has adopted a ‘no shortlisting out’ policy for our dual degree applicants. OMFS needs to regain some autonomy. One size does not fit all.21
There is evidence that supporting trainees during pre-ST training is effective. In 2010, shortly after national selection to OMFS started, the OMFS Mentoring and Support Programme (MSP) for pre-ST OMFS trainees was created.15,22,23 Of the 250 trainees in the MSP who subsequently became eligible to apply for specialty training, over 98% have been successful. This contrasts with the 50% or higher drop-out rate for second degree students aiming for OMFS showing the effectiveness of the programme. A formal ‘OMFS Run-Through-Max’, as recommended by the 2008 PMETB Review of Training14,11 should be at least as effective as the informal MSP.
The published competition ratios for OMFS Specialty Training are summarised in Tables 4 and 5.12,13,24,9,10,21 A recent paper highlighted that approximately one third of appointable candidates at ST1, but for whom there were not enough posts, never reappeared for ST3 recruitment rounds.8,5 Approximately one-third of ST3 posts have gone unfilled.8,12,13,5,9,10 Trainers who have unfilled training posts, and/or have participated in the national selection process have expressed frustration when appointable candidates decline their posts. Successful trainees who cannot accept any of the posts initially offered, could be offered unfilled posts across a longer time window.

As time has passed, our ability to understand the specialty’s own recruitment has been limited by the lack of data provided by Severn Local Education Training Board (LETB). Lack of transparency is adding to the feeling of crisis in the specialty.1
Conclusion
The application ratios for OMFS ST3 recruitment tell a sorry tale. ST1 recruitment data demonstrates there are dual degree trainees who are hungry to pursue higher training in OMFS. We are letting these trainees down.
There is strong support for the PMETB recommendations in the specialty.26 Failure to deliver on the PMETB recommendations has persisted despite unanimous support from our specialty association.25 Dissatisfaction with the current centralised selection process and evidence that there are enough trainers and trainees within OMFS who would be willing to try NIHR style local recruitment and national benchmarking may present an opportunity to finally try implementing recommendations made 15 years ago. What these posts are called and the specifics of local selection are less important than creating a route to appoint earlier than ST to ‘OMFS Run-Through-Max’.
Creating this atypical route helped to address the crisis in academic medicine and dentistry. The crisis in OMFS recruitment matches or exceeds the crisis that provoked the Walport Report. If central funding were to be made available, the posts would follow.
If it proves impossible to persuade all the medical training stakeholders to create OMFS Run-Through-Max posts, then benchmarking before or during a candidate’s second degree and giving strong recognition of this within the ST1 and ST3 person specifications could be a useful step forward. Recognition of the BAOMS MSP within the person specifications did encourage OMFS trainees to use this option during their pre-ST studies and training. Formalising existing support programmes with ARCPs at regional or national levels would improve this support and generate strong evidence to enhance specialty trainees’ applications.
We make three suggestions.
A formal research project should be developed to monitor and understand OMFS specialty recruitment and all those entering OMFS ST1 and ST3 recruitment should be consented to participate in the study. We need to understand what does and does not work.
Pre-ST OMFS trainees should have the option to benefit from a national annual review of their progress and any existing local/regional support should be formalised as much as possible.
The offer of centrally funded ‘Walport’-like NIHR style local selection with national benchmarking to ‘Run-Through-Max’ posts including pre-ST training would stimulate the creation of pre-ST ‘OMFS’ posts. This would include those just embarking on or already enrolled on second degrees to those in second degree studies including OMFS specific Foundation programmes and CREHST posts. A pilot should be part of a formal review programme so that if successful it can be extended.

None needed.","This research project examines the challenges in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) training, focusing on the prolonged duration and discontinuity before specialty training, alongside frequent geographical relocations that disrupt trainees’ progression. Historical reviews, notably the 2008 PMETB report, recommended that specialty training should commence with the second degree; however, previous attempts to implement this have failed. The study proposes a novel “OMFS Run-Through-Max” pathway that integrates OMFS-selected second degree placements, subsequent foundation or ST1 posts, and eventual ST3 posts, thereby ensuring a continuous and cohesive training trajectory.

An online survey conducted in autumn 2022 captured opinions from 306 participants, including consultants, specialty trainees, and pre-specialty trainees. The survey assessed experiences with the current national recruitment process—which has been centralised since 2010—and gathered views on alternative recruitment models. Results revealed that 53% of respondents preferred a local or regional selection process with national benchmarking, while 32% favoured maintaining national selection. Key factors influencing support for local recruitment included the desire for improved geographical continuity, earlier acquisition of training contracts during second degree studies, and enhanced involvement of local faculty in candidate selection. Additionally, the study highlighted significant disparities in fill rates between ST1 and ST3 posts, with many ST3 posts remaining unfilled and candidates often rejecting available offers due to location issues.

In conclusion, the authors argue that OMFS is facing a recruitment crisis that could be mitigated by adopting a NIHR-style, locally appointed, and nationally benchmarked recruitment pathway. They call for further research and pilot programmes to formalise support structures and improve the overall effectiveness of OMFS specialty training.","This study investigates dissatisfaction with the current national recruitment process for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) in the UK, highlighting low fill rates at the ST3 level, geographical relocation issues, and a desire for greater local involvement in trainee selection. A survey of consultants and trainees revealed that a majority (53%) prefer a local or regional selection process over national selection, citing improved trainee selection, geographical continuity, and local faculty involvement as key benefits. The research proposes adapting the NIHR model of locally appointed, nationally benchmarked Academic Clinical Fellow posts to create ""OMFS Run-Through Max"" posts, enabling earlier recruitment during second degree training with ARCP and ST1/ST3 benchmarking. The authors also suggest creating a research project to monitor recruitment and offering centrally funded posts.","This research paper examines the challenges in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) training in the UK, particularly the lack of continuity and geographical relocation issues faced by trainees. The 2008 Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board (PMETB) review recommended starting specialty training at the beginning of the second degree, but this has not been implemented. The study proposes a ""Run-Through-Max"" model, inspired by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Academic Clinical Fellow (ACF) posts, which would allow local recruitment with national benchmarking. A survey of 306 OMFS professionals (consultants, specialty trainees, and pre-specialty trainees) revealed that 53% preferred local or regional recruitment over the current national selection process, citing geographical continuity and stronger local faculty involvement as key benefits. Many respondents supported formalizing pre-specialty training programs, such as the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS) Mentoring and Support Programme, to improve trainee retention and progression. The study highlights the high attrition rates in OMFS training, with many appointable candidates declining ST3 posts due to location preferences. The authors recommend piloting a ""Run-Through-Max"" pathway, formalizing pre-specialty training support, and conducting further research to understand recruitment challenges. The goal is to address the specialty's recruitment crisis and implement the long-overdue PMETB recommendations to improve OMFS training sustainability.",5,2.8,17.83,,,90,90,10,100,80,85,10,100,85,90,10,100

(Integra LifeSciences) is a well-known dermal regeneration template used in partial and full-thickness wound reconstruction. It can be applied directly on to vascular tissue to create a bed for a skin graft, which is often placed in a second surgery. We present our experience of its novel use in oral and maxillofacial surgery patients, using it directly on bone and cartilage (avascular tissue) without further skin grafting. Patients who required full-thickness excision of lesions down to bone or cartilage and who were treated using Integra? were included. After scalp or ear lesion resection, the collagenous dermal layer of Integra? was placed directly on to bone or cartilage and, along with its outer silicone epidermal layer, secured to the defect with absorbable sutures and a bolster dressing. The wounds were kept dry for 14 days, at which point the dressing and silicone were removed and patients continued regular wound care. Seventeen patients were included, 15 of whom had squamous cell carcinoma. One was lost to follow up. The rest achieved complete healing of the defect. Histology showed epidermis developing on the Integra? surface and at one year, the appearance of normal scarred skin. This novel approach could redefine the uses of Integra?, avoiding the need for free-flap surgery or skin grafting when reconstructing large defects. Further resection of close margins or recurrence is easier after reconstruction using dermal regeneration material than after reconstruction with a local or free flap.","Introduction
Surgery to reconstruct skin following the removal of a lesion, for example skin cancer, traditionally involves removing skin from a different area and transplanting it at the location of the defect. This complicated procedure requires hospital admission, and in the elderly it has a significant risk of complications. Laboratory-created dermal regeneration templates are designed to reduce the thickness of the skin needed for transplantation or avoid the need for it completely. The material is a fibrous meshwork that helps to stimulate normal growth of skin. This study reports the novel use of a dermal regeneration template called Integra® (Integra LifeSciences), which is applied directly on to bone in head lesions without the use of skin transplantation. To our knowledge this has not been reported before and is contrary to how the product is designed to be used.
Sixteen patients were followed up after use of this new technique and all achieved complete healing. We therefore conclude that the technique could be suitable for certain groups such as elderly patients with multiple chronic conditions.
Integra® is a dermal regeneration template (DRT) for use in the reconstruction of partial and full-thickness wounds.1 It is composed of two layers. The inner layer is a porous fibre matrix of cross-linked collagen and glycosaminoglycan, which stimulates cell migration from surrounding host tissue into the dermal layer. There is also a thin outer silicone layer that acts as a temporary epidermal substitute to prevent bacterial entry and control fluid loss.2,3
According to the manufacturer, the prerequisites of Integra® include use on vascular tissue, achievement of haemostasis, and a flat and uniform wound bed. Small scalp defects are most often managed by primary closure, but larger defects often require skin grafting or flap reconstruction. Skin grafts are contraindicated for direct use on to full-thickness defects. While skin grafts carry a high success rate, they are not without risk. Complications include donor site morbidity, contraction, contour deficit, infection, and necrosis.4 Free flaps present a challenge in elderly patients who have much comorbidity and who often have reduced tolerability. Elderly patients with multiple skin lesions and widespread skin damage can have ill-defined lesions, making it difficult to achieve clear margins. There is also the risk of recurrence; flap reconstructions make further resections challenging due to loss of the original orientation of the surgical margin.5 DRTs such as Integra® are a viable alternative.6,7
Integra® has been routinely used over vascular layers (such as pericranium) so that only an epidermal skin graft is needed, leaving the dermal layer intact at the donor site.6 The manufacturer advises the reconstruction of defects extending to a vascular bed with Integra® followed by a skin graft. The epidermal silicone layer is then removed, and a thin skin graft placed on to the Integra® dermal layer either immediately or within three weeks postoperatively.8–11 The dermal layer is gradually resorbed over two to three weeks, and replaced by natural protein produced by the skin.
In this paper, we present a series of clinical and histological findings of cases in which Integra® was placed directly on to avascular tissue without a subsequent skin graft, contrary to usual practice.
Material and methods
Patient selection and data collection
We identified a total of 15 patients over a period of four years, who underwent reconstruction of full-thickness, soft tissue defects greater than 5 x 5 cm with direct placement of Integra®. Those without autogenous skin grafting were included. Patients were identified using operating theatre prosthesis usage logbooks. Demographic, operative, histological, and follow-up data were collected retrospectively using medical records.
Reconstructive protocol
Procedures were carried out in a theatre setting. Lesions were prepared with a chlorhexidine or iodine-based solution, and edges were marked and then anaesthetised using local anaesthetic infiltration. Resections were performed with margins taken in accordance with the British Association of Dermatologists’ guidelines.12 Scalp lesions were excised down to bone or cartilage and debrided. Haemostasis was achieved by electrocautery. A sheet of Integra® was cut to fit the size of the defect. Larger defects required multiple sheets attached together with absorbable sutures. The collagenous dermal layer of Integra® was placed directly on to the bony or cartilaginous defect and, along with its outer silicone epidermal layer, secured on to the defect with absorbable sutures. This was then covered with an iodine-soaked bolster dressing and surgical staples. Procedures were performed as day-case surgeries.
Follow up
Patients were asked to keep the dressing and wound clean and dry. They were reviewed in an outpatient dressing clinic between 10 and 21 days postoperatively, and removal of the Integra® silicone epidermal layer was considered. The Integra® was then dressed with a Betadine®-based dressing covered by a secondary atraumatic dressing. Wounds were often found to be exudative and these were dressed with absorbent dressings. The colour of the wound was monitored for signs of vascularisation. Regular dressing care continued in accordance with the local hospital protocol until complete healing was achieved.
Results
Between June 2014 and August 2017, 17 patients were identified. Three were female. The median (range) age was 83 (76–101) years. After histological assessment of the excised lesions, one patient had a pleomorphic dermal sarcoma, one had an atypical fibroxanthoma and 15 had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The median (range) dressing follow up by the nurse was 94 (31–239) days. Patients were seen postoperatively on average 11 times in the dressing clinic (median (range) follow-up time 230 (11–995) days).
One patient died at five months postoperatively due to progression of SCC. All other patients showed complete healing of the reconstructed area during the follow-up period. The only complications were localised infections that required oral antibiotics in two patients. No patient required further reconstruction with a skin graft.
Figure 1 shows one of the patient’s defects following SCC excision and immediate reconstruction with Integra®. Figure 2 shows the healing process following reconstruction with Integra® in a different patient at four weeks and six months.

Figure 4 shows the histology at four weeks, where a clear interface between skin and Integra® can be seen, as well as evidence of chronic inflammation and oedema. Figure 5 shows the histology at one year, where the tissue appears as normal scarred skin. The only remaining evidence of Integra® reconstruction is chronic perivascular inflammation and fibrosis in the dermis. A few eosinophils are also visible. The dermis shows dense collagenisation in keeping with scar tissue. Interestingly, there was the appearance of incidental necrotising palisaded granulomas in both cases, as seen in Figure 6. This is a noteworthy feature as it can be interpreted as an infection in the absence of a surgical history.

Discussion
Integra® was initially intended for use on burn injuries, but is now accepted as a DRT for oncology and trauma cases. In the context of reconstruction, however, most studies report its use on vascular tissue which is then grafted by autogenous epidermis, as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. To our knowledge, the placement of Integra® directly on to bone without further skin grafting has not previously been described.
Data from other units have shown the application of Integra® directly on to bone following burring of the calvarium to achieve adequate bleeding.13 It is not our practice to burr the calvarium before placing the Integra®, and we have not seen treatment fail when this has not been done. Given the histological evidence of the ingrowth of epidermis from the peripheries over the Integra®, it would be logical to avoid excessive bipolar haemostasis of the margins, especially of the epidermis layer. Further research is needed to quantify the distance to which the epidermis can grow over the Integra®, as well as the speed of growth. This could guide the choice of reconstruction method.
The repair of scalp defects can be challenging, especially in the elderly population, usually because of the nature of the disease, multimorbidity, and tolerance. This paper demonstrates the successful application of Integra® DRT on avascular bone and cartilage without the need for skin grafting. Both cosmetic and functional outcomes were acceptable in all patients. Histopathological examination proved that Integra® can successfully mature on to avascular tissue, with histological appearances indistinguishable from normal, albeit scarred, skin after four weeks.
Artificial dermis is beneficial because of the reduction in patient morbidity, procedure complexity, and operating time. Its ease of application and ready availability support its use as a grafting material. Cosmetic outcomes with artificial dermis have also shown reductions in contracture, scarring, and colour differences when compared with skin grafts.14,15
Additionally, as demonstrated by our cases, the use of artificial dermis preserves orientation of the surgical margin, which is a significant advantage from an oncological point of view.6
Free-flap reconstruction is a lengthy general anaesthetic procedure, which commonly requires at least overnight admission in a high dependency unit, often followed by 10 to 14 days of inpatient stay. Conversely, DRTs such as Integra®, which can be placed under a local anaesthetic during a day-case procedure, saves health services significant resources, and outweighs the cost of running nurse-led dressing clinics and the Integra® template (around £400 ($530 USD) for 5 × 5 cm).
We have had widespread success with this technique, but we recognise that our patient cohort presented with primary skin cancer. The use of Integra® on post-radiotherapy skin or skin treated with topical immunomodulators requires further investigation. Histological assessment has shown that epithelialisation is dependent on the ingrowth of epidermis from the peripheries. Presumably, healthy surrounding epidermis is a prerequisite.
In our retrospective review of 17 patients, we found successful application of Integra® on avascular tissue without the need for postoperative skin grafting. Histopathological examination showed excellent healing with dermal fibrosis and epidermal regeneration over the defect, proving that Integra® can be used on its own, and placed directly on avascular tissue while still maturing to skin. These interesting findings offer alternative management for head and neck defects, as well as remarkably redefining the uses of Integra®.

Traditionally, reconstruction after skin cancer excision involves harvesting skin from another site to cover the defect—a process that can be complicated, especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. Integra®, originally designed for use over vascular tissue and followed by skin grafting, consists of a porous collagen and glycosaminoglycan dermal matrix topped with a silicone epidermal substitute. Its typical use is to reduce the amount of autologous skin required and minimize donor site morbidity.

In this retrospective review spanning four years, 17 patients (median age 83) underwent full-thickness scalp reconstruction with direct placement of Integra® after lesion excision. The defects, resulting primarily from squamous cell carcinoma and other skin cancers, were managed as day-case procedures under local anesthesia. The Integra® sheets were secured onto the defect without burring the underlying bone, contrary to some previous methods, and covered with appropriate dressings.

All patients achieved complete healing, with only two experiencing minor localized infections treated successfully with antibiotics. Histological analysis at four weeks and one year postoperatively demonstrated epidermal ingrowth over the Integra®, with the tissue eventually resembling normal, albeit scarred, skin. The findings suggest that this technique is not only safe and effective but also offers advantages such as reduced operative time, lower morbidity, preserved oncological margins, and cost savings compared to traditional free-flap or skin graft reconstructions.","This research paper presents a novel approach to reconstructive surgery following lesion removal on the head, using a dermal regeneration template (DRT) called Integra®. Traditionally, skin grafts are required, but this study explores direct application of Integra® onto bone or cartilage without subsequent skin grafting, a deviation from the manufacturer's instructions.

The study retrospectively reviewed 17 patients who underwent this procedure. Results showed complete healing in all but one patient (who died from cancer progression), with only minor localized infections. Histological analysis confirmed that the Integra® successfully integrated with the underlying tissue, promoting epidermal growth and creating scarred but normal-appearing skin.

The authors suggest this technique is particularly beneficial for elderly patients with comorbidities, reducing surgical complexity, hospitalization, and costs. The method also preserves surgical margin orientation, important for oncological purposes. However, they acknowledge that the technique may be dependent on a healthy epidermis surrounding the area and that further research is needed to assess its efficacy on post-radiotherapy skin or skin treated with topical immunomodulators. The study concludes that Integra® can successfully regenerate skin when placed directly on avascular tissue, offering an alternative management for head and neck defects.","This research paper explores the novel use of Integra®, a dermal regeneration template (DRT), for reconstructing full-thickness skin defects directly on avascular bone and cartilage without the need for skin grafting.

A 10-year review of maxillofacial dog bite injuries,"Meek, E; Lewis, K; Hulbert, J; Mustafa, S",2024,British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,10.1016/j.bjoms.2024.07.012,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2024.07.012,"Dog bites are common within the United Kingdom, with their incidence increasing over recent years. Bites to the head and neck region can have substantial and multifactorial implications for victims, and can provide a challenge to maxillofacial departments. This study is a 10-year retrospective review of head and neck dog bites that required input from the maxillofacial team within the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board. Data collected included demographics of the patients involved, relationship with and breed of dog, nature of the injury, treatment received, and nature of any complications. In total, 168 records matched our inclusion criteria. The median age of our cohort was 12 years, with 57.1% of patients being younger than 15. Of the patients, 52.4% were female. Eighty-three per cent of cases involved a known dog, with Jack Russells being the breed most commonly involved. The upper lip was the most commonly affected area (30.3%), followed by the cheek (24.5%). Twenty-eight per cent of patients were admitted for management in theatre, with 8% of the total patients experiencing a complication. In conclusion, head and neck dog bites most commonly affect children and the upper lip.","Introduction
Dogs have a longstanding reputation for being man’s best friend, with an estimated 31% of households in the United Kingdom owing at least one.1 However, friend can quickly become foe, with the canines of said beloved canines often inflicting injuries. From companion to a formidable adversary, dogs have bite forces of around 937 newtons (N), compared with the 280 N that their two-legged owners can achieve.2,3 Although controversial, American XL Bully dogs have been in the media spotlight recently, with high profile attacks and fatalities.4
Dog bites are a common occurrence, with a recent cross-sectional study finding that 25% of respondents had been bitten by a dog.5 Furthermore, the trend seems to be increasing, with the incidence more than doubling in a 20-year period up to 2018.6 Children are known to be disproportionately affected by dog bites, which is thought to be due to their shorter relative size, coupled with cognitive and motor immaturity.7,8
Rates of dog bites also seem to be inversely proportional to socioeconomic status. Data between 2014 and 2015 in England show that hospital admissions as a result of a dog injury were 2.6 times higher in the most socioeconomically deprived areas compared with the least deprived.9 In the 2019 Welsh Index for Multiple Deprivation report, Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board (CTMUHB) had the largest percentage of deprived areas across Wales. Looking at the most deprived 10% of lower layer super output areas (LSOAs) in Wales, 15% of these were in the CTMUHB, higher than any other health board.10
The impact of dog bites on the individual can be varied and far reaching, ranging from zoonotic infections (rabies, tetanus) to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).11 The psychosocial impact of facial trauma is a well-recognised and important factor and, although not unique to head and neck trauma, can nonetheless be significant.12 It is therefore evident that dog bites are by no means trivial injuries.13 Due to the dirty nature of the wounds, bites can also lead to delayed complications such as infections.14 Within the literature, dog bite infection rates are within the range of 5%–25%, with the variation in rates possibly being attributed to the heterogeneity of the bites and treatment regimens.15
The mechanism of a dog bite involves crushing, tearing, and puncturing, which may also avulse the blood supply of the tissue. These features are thought to lead to a longer inflammatory phase of healing, thereby increasing the likelihood of developing pathological scarring.16 With these injuries being so multifactorial, it comes as no surprise that they pose a challenge to the maxillofacial team.
This study is a retrospective review of dog bites managed by the oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) team within the CTMUHB area between 2012 and 2022. Prevalence and trends of dog bites over this time are outside the remit of this current paper. Instead, we focus on factors pertaining to individuals who have been unfortunate enough to have been bitten by a dog, and subsequently presented at our centre.
Material and methods
The accident and emergency (AE) codes for “Animal bite” and “Maxillofacial patient” were searched between December 2012 and December 2022, covering a 10-year period in the Health Board’s AE database. The search delivered records of all the patients seen with the aforementioned codes within the CTMUHB area. Our inclusion criteria were patients who presented to accident and emergency (A&E) or a minor injuries unit (MIU) in the CTMUHB area with a dog bite to the head and neck region that needed OMFS intervention. This extended to cases in which the OMFS team were consulted via telephone for advice on management.
After these patients were identified, their AE records were scrutinised to ascertain the following factors: demographics, location of injury in the head and neck area, relationship of patient to dog, breed of dog, and treatment received.
The presence of postoperative complications was evaluated by assessing the presence and content of letters sent by the maxillofacial team to the general medical practitioner (GMP).
Results
From a total of 401 records, 168 matched our inclusion criteria. These spanned a time frame from December 2012 to December 2022 (Fig. 1).

Gender distribution
Of the 168 records, 88 (52.4%) patients were female and 80 (47.6%) male.
Relationship to the dog
A total of 139 records (83%) noted that the dog involved was known to the patient. Seventeen cases (10%) involved an unknown dog. In 10 cases the relationship to the patient was not documented.
Breed of dog
The breed of dog was stated in only 66 cases (39%). Nineteen different breeds of dog were noted. Border Collies accounted for six cases (10% of documented cases), and Staffordshire Bull Terriers for seven cases (11%), as did Spaniels. Bulldogs accounted for eight cases (12%), and Jack Russell Terriers accounted for nine (14%).
Injury location
The location of the injuries was quantified into categories. The upper lip was the area most commonly affected (30.3%), followed by the cheek (24.5%). The neck and scalp were the least affected (1.4% and 1.0% of cases, respectively) (Fig. 3).

Treatment of injuries
Of the 168 patients seen, 47 (28%) were admitted to allow for closure of the wound(s) in a theatre setting under general anaesthesia. A total of 148 patients (88%) were discharged with antibiotics. Of those included in our study, none died as a result of their injuries.
Fourteen patients (8%) experienced a postoperative complication following treatment. Seven (4.2%) of these complications were a result of scarring, and four (2.4%) were due to infection. The remainder were due to wound dehiscence and retained sutures. There were no recorded cases of zoonotic infections.
Discussion
Age distribution
The age distribution of those affected by dog bites mirrors other studies, and ties in with the notion of dog bite incidence being inversely proportional to age.8 A recent 20-year review of dog bites to the head and neck found that 50% of their sample were younger than 18 years of age.17 In our case, 57.1% of the patients were younger than 15 years, reflecting a greater number of injuries in children.
Gender distribution
The gender distribution of dog bite injuries varies throughout the literature. In this current study, females accounted for 52.4%. A cross-sectional survey of households found that males were 1.81 times more likely to be bitten by a dog than females.5 Furthermore a 20-year retrospective analysis also found that males had a higher incidence of dog bites than females; however, these studies were not specific to the head and neck region.6 Looking at bites in children, a year-long retrospective review showed no gender difference in head and neck bites, with men being affected more when considering general dog bites.7 Conflictingly, a recent study, which looked specifically at head and neck injuries in children, found that girls were affected more than boys.18 The notable variation in the gender that is affected most may reflect a difference in cultural behaviours towards dogs in different geographical areas. Furthermore, in our study, a selection bias may be present, as we studied only those who attended A&E or MIU units. Men may be less likely to seek medical treatment.
Characteristics of the dog
The relationship of the dog to the patient in our study showed a remarkable trend, with 83% of dog bite injuries being caused by a known dog. Studies within a paediatric population have also shown that known dogs caused 72% of head and neck bites.7,18 Due to the retrospective nature of this review, medical notes were scrutinised and, as such, the breed of dog was noted in only 39% of cases. With such a low percentage of cases stating the breed, confidence in identifying any trends based on this data is therefore low. Other studies, however, have commented on the high incidence of Pit Bull Terrier, German Shepherd, and Husky breeds.7 The Dangerous Dogs Act (1991) prohibits or restricts the ownership of certain dog breeds, and makes it an offence to allow any dog to be dangerously out of control.19 In our sample, we did not identify any dogs covered by this Act, including XL Bully dogs. Future prospective studies might be able to gain a better understanding of the breeds involved in facial dog bites. A pro forma would ensure more thorough documentation of the cases involved.
Injury location
Our findings of injury location tie in with the work of others, with a 10-year review also finding that the upper lip was the site most commonly affected (32.75%) followed by the cheek (23.35%).17 This study did, however, manage to distinguish the periorbital area from the cheek. Our study design relied on scrutinising medical records, and variation in the quality of documentation resulted in some confusion of these two areas (meaning that periorbital areas were not distinguished from the cheek/forehead). Within the head and neck region, behaviours such as kissing and holding a dog’s face close to that of the owner are known to increase the risk of a facial dog bite, which may account for the high incidence of upper lip bites.20
Assessment and treatment options
Of our patients, 28% of those who presented required admission. The work of other authors shows an admission percentage of 35%.17 With the median age of those admitted being six years, it is reasonable to assume that the main reason for admitting for theatre closure under general anaesthetic was lack of cooperation.
Eighty-eight per cent of patients seen were given antibiotics on discharge. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on the use of antibiotics in the UK were only published in November 2020, so it would be unfair to compare overall performance with these.21 In an equivalent study, 95.52% of patients were prescribed antibiotics on discharge.17 Further studies should aim to establish adherence to the aforementioned antimicrobial guidelines.
Of the 8% of patients who developed postoperative complications, only 2.4% of these resulted from an infective complication. The quoted incidence of postoperative infection of head and neck dog bite wounds is in the range of 5% - 25%.15 Based on this, infective complications at our centre seem to be on the lower side of those reported in the general literature. Four per cent of patients suffered a postoperative complication related to scarring.
It is important to note that the external validity of this study and the trends that it presents relate only to the cohort studied (those who received input from the maxillofacial team). In the process of collecting data, it was clear to the authors that a large number of patients did not receive input from the maxillofacial team and were treated independently in A&E and MIU units. Of 348 records pertaining to head and neck dog bites, 180 (51.7%) did not receive OMFS input. It should therefore be noted that those patients included in this study are likely to be a cohort that had more extensive injuries than those with head and neck dog bites in general.
Conclusion
Dog bites are common, with their management comprising a significant amount of an OMFS department’s workload. Our study shows that children are most at risk, with the upper lip being the most common site of injury, which correlates with current literature. Within our centre, admission following a dog bite was largely based on the level of the patient’s cooperation with treatment. Further work should look at the breeds of dog involved in head and neck dog bites, and adherence with current antimicrobial guidance.

Motivated by rising concerns over dog bite incidents in the UK, the study focuses on injuries requiring OMFS intervention, with children disproportionately affected due to their smaller stature and developmental vulnerabilities. Dog bites can cause severe trauma from crushing, tearing, and puncturing, leading to complications such as infections, scarring, and psychological distress.

Accident and emergency records were searched using specific codes for “Animal bite” and “Maxillofacial patient” to identify relevant cases. Out of 401 records, 168 met the inclusion criteria. Data collected included patient demographics, injury location, the relationship between patient and dog, breed, and treatment details. The median patient age was 12 years, with 57.1% being 15 years or younger, and a near-equal gender distribution. Notably, 83% of bites were inflicted by known dogs, and the upper lip was the most commonly injured site (30.3%). Approximately 28% of patients required admission for surgical wound closure under general anaesthesia, and 88% were discharged with antibiotics.

Dog bites are a significant public health issue, with children being disproportionately affected due to their size and developmental immaturity. The study highlights that 57.1% of the 168 patients included were aged 15 or younger, with the upper lip being the most commonly injured site (30.3%). Most bites (83%) were inflicted by dogs known to the victims, though the breed was documented in only 39% of cases, with no involvement of breeds restricted under the Dangerous Dogs Act (1991).

The study found that 28% of patients required hospital admission for wound closure under general anesthesia, often due to the young age of the patients. Antibiotics were prescribed to 88% of patients upon discharge, and postoperative complications occurred in 8% of cases, primarily scarring (4.2%) and infection (2.4%). The infection rate was lower than the 5%-25% range reported in other studies. The paper emphasizes the need for better documentation of dog breeds involved in bites and adherence to antimicrobial guidelines. It also notes that the study's findings are limited to more severe cases requiring OMFS intervention, as many dog bite patients were treated independently in emergency settings.

To pursue a career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) in the United Kingdom (UK) clinicians must hold degrees in both medicine and dentistry.1 The financial implications of attaining both degrees and the associated costs of training have been well reported. In 2016, it was estimated that the total training cost of becoming an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon was approximately £116,000; with inflation adjusted in January 2024 this equates to approximately £151,000. Other sources state the cost of undertaking a second degree alone to be around £200,000.1–3 Tuition fees in the UK are currently set at £9250 per year, and although some second-degree students can access partial funding from Student Finance England (SFE) and various bursary programmes, to cover the cost of a second degree many must work alongside their studies.
For those qualified in dentistry first this means working alongside studying a full-time three-, four-, or five-year medical degree. This part-time work must be undertaken outside of hours from the full-time programme, during weekends, nights, and out of term time. The pressure of the debt incurred during a second degree is something that 79% of trainees were ‘concerned’ or ‘very concerned’ about with the financial impact on undertaking the second degree the worst factor of undertaking the degree in 41% of cases.4,5 The stresses and implications that this places on the lives of those wishing to pursue a career in OMFS can be linked to the retention issues faced within the specialty. This is evident with only 54% of the Speciality Training 3 (ST3) places appointed to in 2023.6 This study aims to assess the current working roles and patterns of dentally qualified medical students and the roles they wish to gain more experience in. Analysing this will increase the knowledge base of the workload trainees are undertaking during their second degree and aid OMFS units in how they can best support them and enhance their engagement with the specialty.
Material and methods
The questionnaire shown in Appendix A was formulated by the authors following a comprehensive literature review. Sixteen questions were selected to assess the working roles and patterns of trainees and funding received. It was distributed online using the SurveyMonkey Inc© platform to members of the Junior Trainees’ Group (JTG) of the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (BAOMS) Facebook© group and via second degree student WhatsApp© groups. Responses were collected from 27/04/2023 to 31/07/2023. The inclusion criteria were set as dentists studying medicine at the time of survey distribution and dentists who have completed their medical degree within the past year at the time of distribution who were asked to complete the survey in a retrospective manner.
Results
There were 45 responses included in the study from 16 different universities in the UK. Three responses were excluded as they were completed by students studying at universities outside the UK. Working in OMFS was undertaken by 96% (n = 43), with 49% (n = 22) working in an OMFS unit affiliated with the university at which they study. An average of 58 hours a month of paid work was being completed which equates to approximately 13 hours a week.
First on-call OMFS roles were undertaken by 78% (n = 35) and second on-call roles by 38% (n = 17). Night shifts were being worked by 84% (n = 38). Working general duties roles within OMFS such as: consultation clinics, minor oral surgery lists and theatre lists were completed by 51% (n = 23). Working as a dentist in primary care was being done by 31% (n = 14) (Fig. 1). The main source of income for 80% (n = 36) was OMFS on-call shifts.

Fig. 1 The type of paid role undertaken. OMFS first on-call roles were worked by 78% (n = 35). Second on-call OMFS roles were carried out by 38% (n = 17). Working OMFS clinics and operating lists were carried out by 51% (n = 23). Working as a dentist in primary care was undertaken by 31% (n = 14). Non-clinical jobs and working in non-surgical facial aesthetics were worked by 2% (n = 1) each.
The median pre-tax earnings per annum recorded were in the range of £30,000 to £39,999. The most recorded earning ranges were between £10,000 to £19,999 and £40,000 to £49,999, accounting for 22% (n = 10) of responses each (Fig. 2). Some form of locum work was undertaken by 96% (n = 43) (Fig. 3). Working whilst studying medicine had a positive or strong positive perceived effect on the OMFS clinical skill set of 62% (n = 28) (Fig. 4). Funding was received by 56% (n = 25) via SFE, with 78% (n = 35) receiving funding via the NHS bursary scheme. The BAOMS student bursary scheme was accessed by 24% (n = 11). Funding through other bursary schemes was only attained by 7% (n = 3). The main role trainees wished to gain more experience working in was OMFS day theatre operating lists (Fig. 5), with this being the case for 84% (n = 38).

Fig. 5 Type of jobs second-degree trainees wished to gain more experience in. Gaining more experience working OMFS day theatre operating lists during their second degree was wished for by 84% (n = 38). Gaining more surgical experience working local anaesthetic minor oral surgery lists was wished for by 69% (n = 31). The role respondents least wished to work more of during the second degree was OMFS 1st on-call, with only 16% (n = 7) wishing to gain more experience in this role.
Discussion
Most second-degree students in this study work in OMFS roles and rely heavily on them as their main source of income. This is reflected elsewhere in the literature with rates of second-degree students working in OMFS reported at 74% and 77%.4,7 This highlights the pivotal role OMFS units play in supporting trainees during their second degree. Approximately half of those working in an OMFS unit were working at one affiliated with their university. This suggests that OMFS units should consider how they can create stronger ties with second-degree students at their linked university. Second-degree students have previously proposed that designated OMFS senior support would aid in recruitment.8 If this were employed by OMFS units in conjunction with their local medical school, it would help develop a stronger support network for students, keeping them engaged and involved with the specialty.8 However, some may work in units close to their home or families that may not be affiliated with their medical school. Trainees may then later apply to training posts outside their university location, which may be less well subscribed to, increasing their chances of attaining a desired post and benefiting these undersubscribed areas.
Second-degree students working in an OMFS unit also bring benefits to the unit, often covering gaps in the rota or night shifts. A total of 84% of the students in this survey work night shifts and it has been reported elsewhere that 80% of second-degree students are working at the weekend.9 This highlights the amount of out-of-hours work that is being covered by second-degree students. This work is predominantly at a first on-call level.9 The dentally qualified medical students in this study often come into these roles having previously gained experience working in OMFS, with it being reported that 94% of dentists start medical school having 20 months or more of OMFS experience.10
Both medical and dental degrees are full-time programmes. Working around these requires students to work during the evenings, nights, weekends and out of term time. A study on the working patterns of medically qualified dental students reported an average of 27 hours a week of work being undertaken whilst studying, in comparison to just over 13 hours a week reported in this study on dentally qualified medical students.7 Working on top of the requirements of completing a medical or dental degree impacts upon the time available for activities or pursuits outside of OMFS; such as spending time with family or friends. This has been recognised as one of the biggest drawbacks of becoming dual qualified, with the effect on family and personal life being cited as a drawback by 41% of participants in previous studies.4 It is this impact on work-life balance which 44% of dual-qualified trainees have previously cited as the reason for not wanting to pursue higher training.11 Herbet et al, reported how women are overrepresented in dual-qualified trainees that were no longer interested in pursuing a career in OMFS. Work-life balance and family planning issues were attributed towards this.11 This highlights the importance of how during the second degree ensuring a work-life balance is critical to the retention of trainees.
Retention of trainees has repeatedly been raised as an issue for the specialty.10,11 This is shown with only 70% of all posts advertised at ST3 level between 2010-2019 being filled. Addressing this during the second degree phase is vital as it has been shown that most of those that leave training do so in the first couple of years following attainment of their dual qualification.11 This is reflected in the drop off in the latest competition ratios (round 1, 2023) for specialty training places going from 3.17 at ST1 level to 0.73 at ST3.12 This suggests that trainees unsuccessful at ST1 may not necessarily take up a core surgery post and reapply at ST3. Working extensive hours and night shifts during the second degree may be a factor in burnout, which may manifest with trainees deciding to leave the specialty. Burnout rates amongst OMFS trainees and consultants have been reported at 67.7% and this coupled with the high rates of anxiety and depression amongst surgeons emphasise how it is vital that second-degree trainees are supported to reduce the risk their working patterns have on exacerbating these.13,14 Not only will this protect trainees but also patients as a significant association between burnout in surgeons and patient safety has been reported.15
This study has highlighted that 84% of second-degree students wish to gain more operative experience. It has been shown that providing trainees with more surgical experience means they are more likely to pursue the specialty.11 It will also improve the surgical skill level of trainees and make them more competitive during specialty applications. If OMFS units provided more opportunities for second-degree students to gain surgical experience, such as in a day theatre environment, it would also foster engagement with the specialty and aid in career development. This has been shown to be an issue for second-degree students with some feeling they are deskilling.8
The more funding available for second-degree students through bursaries, and the greater their accessibility, will help to reduce the burden of working during the second degree. Less than a quarter of those in this study received funding via the BAOMS student bursary scheme with Olding et al showing that poor or no awareness of the BAOMS student bursary was reported by 72% of those to whom it would have been available.4 Varying levels of funding via SFE and the NHS bursary scheme have been shown. Second-degree students should be made as aware as possible of the funding available to them, especially given that most of them have previously requested more information on sources of funding.4 Creating resources for second-degree students to improve their awareness of the available funds and aiding them with their applications will help reduce the financial burden on these trainees.
The financial burden of attaining dual qualification is often noted as its main drawback.4,11 The loss of earnings, loss of pay protection, cost of university fees and stasis of career progression results in an estimated cost of upwards of £200,000 in some reports.1 For clinicians qualified first in medicine the cost of meeting the requirements for ST3 for OMFS is 7.5 times greater when compared with other specialties such as plastic surgery or general surgery.16 Ways of reducing this burden must be explored and progress made to address this issue as it is a recurring link to the issues surrounding retention that has not been resolved.
This study has added an insight into the current spread of earnings for those undertaking the second degree. It should be noted that for most trainees even before incurring the cost of university fees and affiliated second degree costs they will have taken a significant pay cut during the second degree period. Issues with the lack of pay protection heighten this and a clear framework needs to be put in place to address this, so those pursuing the second degree are not penalised when they enter the next stage of their training.
Working roles outside of OMFS have been shown to be undertaken by many studying their second degree. Often, for clinicians qualified in dentistry first these are roles working in primary care as a dentist. For medically qualified dental students this is often working in other specialties such as otolaryngology, general surgery and in the emergency department.4,7 This study demonstrated a low number of second-degree students undertaking non-surgical facial aesthetics as a source of income in comparison with medically qualified first clinicians at the same stage of training.7 Second-degree students should be aware of the wide range of working roles available to them and those that will best help them achieve a good work-life balance.
Limitations
Information on the total target population reached was unable to be obtained; having such information would aid in strengthening the survey results. Not all members of the JTG Facebook© group are current second-degree students and it is highly probable that all the intended target audience were not reached by the authors.
Conclusions
Studying for both a medical and dental degree incurs a significant financial commitment, and for most, working during their second degree is not optional to fund their studies. The number of hours worked unsociably such as evenings, weekends and nights on top of the hours necessary to complete a full-time medical or dental degree highlights the significant personal commitment trainees make during this time. These hours when worked in OMFS should provide trainees with training opportunities to improve their clinical skills. OMFS units provide a significant amount of support to trainees during their second degree but also benefit from having trainees work in their departments. For the future of the specialty to flourish emphasis needs to be placed on supporting second-degree students during this period to keep engagement with the specialty but more importantly to produce clinicians with a work-life balance that facilitates their career progression and reduces the risk of burnout.

Funding
Joshua Lopez received a personal student bursary award from the BAOMS to complete this project. The other authors declare that no funds, grants, or other support were received during this manuscript’s preparation.","This research project examines the working roles, financial pressures, and training experiences of dentally qualified medical students pursuing dual qualifications in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) in the UK. To practice in OMFS, clinicians must complete both medical and dental degrees—a pathway that incurs substantial financial burdens. Estimates suggest that the total cost of training was around £116,000 in 2016, rising to approximately £151,000 in 2024 when adjusted for inflation, with some reports placing the cost of a second degree near £200,000. Despite partial funding opportunities from Student Finance England (SFE) and various bursaries, many students are compelled to work alongside their studies to offset these expenses.

The study utilized an online questionnaire distributed between April and July 2023, gathering 45 responses from 16 UK universities. Findings revealed that 96% of respondents were employed in OMFS roles, with nearly half working in university-affiliated OMFS units. On average, trainees worked about 58 hours per month (roughly 13 hours weekly) in paid roles. Common duties included first on-call positions (78%), second on-call roles (38%), and night shifts (84%), with OMFS on-call shifts forming the primary income source. Median pre-tax earnings were reported between £30,000 and £39,999, and most trainees (62%) felt that working enhanced their clinical skills.

The discussion highlights the critical role of OMFS units in supporting trainees, emphasizing the need for more structured operative opportunities (especially in day theatre settings), better funding awareness, improved pay protection, and work-life balance measures to reduce burnout and enhance long-term retention in the specialty.","This UK-based study investigates the working roles and patterns of dentists pursuing a medical degree to become Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (OMFS). It addresses the significant financial burden and its potential impact on trainee retention, given the requirement for dual qualifications in the UK. A survey of 45 dentist-medical students revealed that nearly all work in OMFS-related roles, primarily relying on locum OMFS on-call shifts for income and averaging 58 hours a month. While 62% perceive a positive impact on their OMFS skills, 84% desire more operating theatre experience. Although 56% receive Student Finance England funding, other bursary schemes are underutilized. The study highlights the pivotal role OMFS units play in supporting trainees and suggests strengthening ties with university-affiliated programs. It further emphasizes the need for improved work-life balance and greater surgical experience to promote trainee engagement, career progression, and reduce burnout, ultimately bolstering retention within the specialty.","This research paper explores the challenges faced by dentally qualified medical students pursuing a career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) in the UK, where dual qualifications in medicine and dentistry are required.
